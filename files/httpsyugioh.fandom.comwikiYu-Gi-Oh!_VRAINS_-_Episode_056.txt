 Summary 
 Before the duel against Soulburner, Blue Gal thinks to herself that she won't let herself  Akira  down, having been tasked with capturing an  Ignis . She warns her opponent that she won't go easy, and Soulburner replies that he didn't expect she would. Blue Gal, full of confidence after rebuilding her deck, gets ready to duel.  Flame  informs Soulburner of Blue Gal's strategy, to which Soulburner replies that they need to take the first move. Soulburner speeds over to a level position with Blue Gal, proposing that whoever wins the race to the arch ahead of them gets to go first. Blue Gal agrees, and wins that race after Soulburner has to dodge a falling rock. 
 During Blue Gal's first turn, Soulburner takes 400 damage, and grunts at his opponent's combo plays.  Ghost Gal  watches with a smile as Blue Gal ends her turn, then activates her " Trickstar Lycoris '" effect just as Soulburner draws to start his turn. Blue Gal claims also to have studied Soulburner, revealing that she knows how his Skill works. Flame postulates that they would lose if they time their Skill incorrectly. Soulburner nevertheless continues the duel, fully aware of the burn potential of his opponent's " Trickstar Divaridis ". He is already down to 2200 Life Points when he brings out " Salamangreat Heatleo ", only for " Trickstar Birdhelm " to effectively negate its ability. 
 Soulburner decides to go into battle, thinking that Blue Gal's weakness is her monsters being easy to beat over. But Blue Gal responds that she's repaired that as well, demonstrating with her " Trickstar Corobane " hand trap. (In the dub, Blue Gal pronounces "Corobane" with its original Japanese name of "Calobane".) Soulburner takes 1300 damage, but then smiles that he still has "Heatleo" because of " Salamangreat Wolvie ".  When Soulburner ends his turn, Flame tells him he's already down by more than 3000 Life Points, only for the conversation to descend into bickering similar to  Ai 's with  Playmaker .
 During Blue Gal's turn, she reveals "Birdhelm's" other effect. Flame ponders on whether their opponent is running out of weaknesses to exploit. Soulburner decides to prove her wrong by activating a trap that lets him be immune to small burn effects. Thus, Blue Gal changes tack, by first  Link Summoning  " Trickstar Holly Angel ", then using it to  Fusion Summon  " Trickstar Band Sweet Guitar ". Soulburner is surprised to see his opponent play a  Fusion Monster , and is even more so when Blue Gal reveals that "Sweet Guitar" can double burn damage, making his " Gate of Fire " ineffective. Blue Gal goes into battle aiming to end the duel in her victory, and is denied this when Soulburner gains Life Points through "Salamangreat Raccoon". However, Blue Gal then mistimes the effect of her returned "Corobane", discarding it on "Divaridis'" attack rather than "Sweet Guitar's" attack. This allows Soulburner to start his next turn on 1500 Life Points.
 Soulburner doesn't draw the card he needs on his normal draw. After another small discussion with Flame, Soulburner puts his right fist on his chest. Only then does Blue Gal realize that she did not stop her opponent from using his Skill. Soulburner plays the card he drew, " Fusion of Fire ", with Blue Gal confident that her "Divaridis" will deal the damage that would give her the win. However, to Blue Gal's absolute horror, "Divaridis" is Fusion Material for the Fusion Summon itself, of " Salamangreat Violet Chimera ". 
 The watching Ghost Gal admits she never saw that play coming. "Violet Chimera" then uses its first effect to be able to beat over "Sweet Guitar", and its second effect to dodge "Corobane". "Sweet Guitar" is destroyed and Blue Gal loses all her Life Points to a single attack. She is knocked off her board and struggles to stand on the rock she was knocked against. Soulburner hovers over towards Blue Gal, praising his teamwork with Flame while appearing to commiserate Blue Gal. When Blue Gal tries to explain that her brother wants to know more about the Ignis, Soulburner decides not to entertain the idea, and logs Blue Gal out due to her exhaustion.
 Ghost Gal hovers over, having noticed what Soulburner did, and is thankful due to Blue Gal not being able to log herself out. When Soulburner stumbles on his  D-Board , Ghost Gal recommends that Soulburner takes a rest too, but not before asking to log her out as well. Flame conjures up an emergency logout program for Ghost Gal to use. Before Ghost Gal logs out, she flatters Flame with her charm. Meanwhile, Playmaker arrives to a location Ai describes as the "edge of this world", which is where Playmaker knows  Bohman  is.
 
 Featured Duel: Soulburner vs. Blue Gal 
         
 The Duel is conducted as a  Speed Duel .
 Turn 1: Blue Gal 
 Blue Gal  activates the Spell Card " Trickstar Vision ", Special Summoning a " Trickstar " monster from her hand with its effects negated and ATK halved, then letting both players draw a card. She Special Summons " Trickstar Lilybell " (800 → 400/2000). Blue Gal activates the effect of " Trickstar Lycoris " in her hand, Special Summoning it (1600/1200), then returning a "Trickstar" monster she controls to her hand. She returns "Lilybell" to her hand. As "Lilybell" was added to her hand by a method other than drawing, Blue Gal activates its effect, Special Summoning it (800/2000). Blue Gal uses "Lilybell" and "Lycoris" to Link Summon " Trickstar Divaridis " (1800/LINK-2/↙↓) to the Extra Monster Zone. As "Divaridis" was Special Summoned, Blue Gal activates its effect, inflicting 200 damage to  Soulburner  (Soulburner: 4000 → 3800 LP). Blue Gal activates the Field Spell Card " Trickstar Live Stage ". As "Live Stage" was activated, Blue Gal uses its effect, adding a "Trickstar" monster from her GY to her hand. She adds "Lycoris". Blue Gal activates the effect of "Live Stage", Special Summoning a " Trickstar Token " (0/0) in Defense Position to a zone a "Trickstar" Link Monster points to. She Special Summons it to a zone "Divaridis" points to. Blue Gal Tributes a "Trickstar Token" to Tribute Summon " Trickstar Birdhelm " (0/1800). As "Birdhelm" was Normal Summoned, Blue Gal activates its effect, inflicting 200 damage to Soulburner (Soulburner: 3800 → 3600 LP), then drawing a card, however Blue Gal cannot conduct her Battle Phase this turn. Blue Gal activates the effect of "Lycoris" in her hand, Special Summoning it (1600/1200), then returning a "Trickstar" monster she controls to her hand. She returns "Birdhelm" to her hand. Blue Gal activates the effect of "Birdhelm" in her hand, equipping it to a "Trickstar" Link Monster she controls.
 Turn 2: Soulburner 
Soulburner draws "Gate of Fire". As a card was added to Soulburner's hand, the effect of "Lycoris" inflicts 200 damage to him for each card added (Soulburner: 3600 → 3400 LP). Soulburner activates the effect of " Salamangreat Meer " in his hand, sending a " Salamangreat " monster from his hand to the GY to Special Summon it (800/600). He sends " Salamangreat Falco ". As Soulburner Normal or Special Summoned a monster, the effect of "Divaridis" inflicts 200 damage to him (Soulburner: 3400 → 3200 LP). Soulburner activates the effect of "Falco" in his GY, returning a "Salamangreat" monster he controls to the hand to Special Summon it (1200/1600). He returns "Meer". The effects of "Divaridis" and "Lycoris" are applied (Soulburner: 3200 → 3000 → 2800 LP). As "Meer" was added to Soulburner's hand other than his normal draw, he activates its effect, Special Summoning it (800/600). The effect of "Divaridis" is applied (Soulburner: 2800 → 2600 LP). Soulburner Normal Summons " Salamangreat Wolvie " (1700/1000) (Soulburner: 2600 → 2400 LP). Soulburner uses "Meer", "Falco" and "Wolvie" to Link Summon " Salamangreat Heatleo " (2300/LINK-3/↙↑↘) to the Extra Monster Zone (Soulburner: 2400 → 2200 LP). While "Birdhelm" is equipped to a "Trickstar" monster by its effect, Soulburner cannot target cards Blue Gal controls with card effects. Soulburner Sets a card.
 "Heatleo" attacks "Divaridis". During the Damage Step, as her "Trickstar" monster is battling Soulburner's monster, Blue Gal activates the effect of " Trickstar Corobane " in her hand, sending it to the GY to increase the ATK of "Divaridis" by its original ATK ("Divaridis": 1800 → 3600 ATK). As "Wolvie" was used as a Link Material for the Link Summon of a "Salamangreat" Link Monster, that Link Monster cannot be destroyed by battle or card effects this turn. The attack continues and "Heatleo" is not destroyed (Soulburner: 2200 → 900 LP).
 Turn 3: Blue Gal 
As there is a Set card in Soulburner's Spell & Trap Zone, Blue Gal activates the effect of "Live Stage", Special Summoning a "Trickstar Token" (0/0). While "Birdhelm" is equipped to a "Trickstar" monster by its effect, the equipped monster gains an effect that inflicts 200 damage to Soulburner each time a "Trickstar" monster is Special Summoned. As a card or effect that would inflict damage to Soulburner is activated, he activates his face-down Continuous Trap Card " Gate of Fire ", preventing either player from taking 300 or less effect damage. Blue Gal activates her Skill "Trickstar Gig", sending cards from the top of her Deck to the GY equal to the number of "Trickstar" monsters she controls, then adding a "Trickstar" card from her GY to her hand. She adds "Trickstar Fusion". Blue Gal uses a "Trickstar Token" and "Lycoris" to Link Summon " Trickstar Holly Angel " (2000/LINK-2/↙↘) to a zone "Divaridis" points to. Blue Gal activates the effect of "Live Stage", Special Summoning a "Trickstar Token" (0/0) in Defense Position to a zone "Divaridis" points to.
 Blue Gal activates the Spell Card " Trickstar Fusion ", Fusion Summoning a "Trickstar" Fusion Monster from her Extra Deck using monsters from her hand or field as Fusion Materials. She fuses "Holly Angel" and a "Trickstar Token" to Fusion Summon " Trickstar Band Sweet Guitar " (2200/1200) to a zone "Divaridis" points to. As "Sweet Guitar" was Special Summoned, the effect of "Divaridis" that was granted by "Birdhelm" inflicts 200 damage to Soulburner, but all effect damage from the effect of a "Trickstar" monster that points to "Sweet Guitar" is doubled (Soulburner: 900 → 500 LP). As Soulburner took damage from the effect of a "Trickstar" monster, the effect of "Sweet Guitar" activates, increasing its ATK equal to the damage taken until the End Phase ("Sweet Guitar": 2200 → 2600 ATK). Blue Gal activates the effect of "Trickstar Fusion" in her GY, banishing it to add a "Trickstar" monster from her GY to her hand, however Blue Gal cannot Normal or Special Summon monsters with that name for the rest of this turn. She adds "Calobane" to her hand.
 "Sweet Guitar" attacks "Heatleo".  As Blue Gal's monster attacked his monster, Soulburner activates the effect of " Salamangreat Raccoon " in his hand, sending it to the GY to gain LP equal to the ATK of Blue Gal's attacking monster, prevent his monster from being destroyed, and prevent Blue Gal from activating card effects until the end of the Damage Step (Soulburner: 500 → 3100 LP). The attack continues and "Heatleo" is not destroyed (Soulburner: 3100 → 2800 LP). "Divaridis" attacks "Heatleo". Blue Gal activates the effect of "Calobane" in her hand ("Divaridis": 1800 → 3600 ATK). The attack continues and "Heatleo" is not destroyed (Soulburner: 2800 → 1500 LP). During the End Phase, as "Sweet Guitar" attacked this turn, Blue Gal activates its effect, returning the ATK gained by its effect to 0 ("Sweet Guitar": 2600 → 2200 ATK), then adding a "Trickstar" monster from her GY to her hand. She adds "Calobane".
 Turn 4: Soulburner 
Soulburner activates his Skill "Burning Draw", lowering his LP to 100 to draw a card for every 1000 LP lost (Soulburner: 1500 → 100 LP), in this case one. He draws and subsequently activates the Spell Card " Fusion of Fire ", Fusion Summoning a "Salamangreat" Fusion Monster from his Extra Deck using monsters from his hand or either side of the field as Fusion Materials. He fuses "Heatleo" and "Divaridis" to Fusion Summon " Salamangreat Violet Chimera " (2800/2000) to the Extra Monster Zone. As "Violet Chimera" was Fusion Summoned, Soulburner activates its effect, increasing its ATK by an amount equal to the half the total ATK of the Fusion Material Monsters used for its Fusion Summon ("Violet Chimera": 2800 → 4850 ATK).
 "Violet Chimera" attacks "Sweet Guitar". Blue Gal activates the effect of "Calobane" in her hand ("Sweet Guitar": 2200 → 4400 ATK). As "Violet Chimera" is battling a monster whose current ATK is different from its original ATK, Soulburner activates its effect, doubling its ATK during damage calculation ("Violet Chimera": 4850 → 9700 ATK). The attack continues and "Sweet Guitar" is destroyed (Blue Gal: 4000 → 0 LP).
