 Summary 
   This summary is currently incomplete. 
 When  Yuya  comes to in their hideout,  Yuto  and  Yuri  inform him of everything that occurred after the Duel against  Sora  and that  Yugo  is resting following his Duel against  Ren  and whatever faction he is with. As  Yuzu  arrives after picking up groceries, Yuya notices someone messed with security system and now a “friend” is on his way over. He learns it was  Reiji Akaba , teling a confused Yuzu to sell his stuff should he not return as he quickly activates the trap door under Reiji to take them away from the girl. Meanwhile, with  Shingo  following him,  Shun  searches Leo Corporation excavation site that Reiji was last seen and the two of them find the room visited along with with a frozen digital clock and  science magazines dating twenty years from now.
 After Yuya's trap brought them to a spacious cavern far below Yuya’s hideout, Reiji notices an escape pod and deduces it to be Yuya's. Yuya confirms this and knew of Reiji's reputation since their fathers worked on  Solid Vision  together, expecting they would eventually meet while attempting to convince him that they do not need to fight. But Reiji insists on Dueling Yuya here and now to keep him from obtaining  Genesis Omega Dragon .
