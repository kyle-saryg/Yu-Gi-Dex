 FIRE  ( 炎   Honō  "Fire" or "Flame") is an  Attribute  commonly associated with  Pyro ,  Dragon ,  Dinosaur  and  Machine - Type  monsters, though it is not uncommon in other Types such as  Warrior  or even  Beast . FIRE is diametrically opposed to  WATER , but there is no direct advantage outside some of the video games (however this idea also appears in the effects of some cards like " Frost and Flame Dragon ", " Elemental HERO Inferno ", " Star Boy " or " Little Chimera ").
 FIRE monsters tend to focus on inflicting  Effect damage  to the opponent, a mechanic traditionally known as " Burning ". In recent years, a trend among FIRE monsters is that many of them have 200  DEF .
 Recent FIRE  Archetypes  are also fast and combo-oriented, and while they are slow at the start, they tend to build-up for huge plays that often result in  One Turn Kills . They also tend to use some  Anti-Meta  strategies, like  Graveyard  manipulation,  banishing  and negating effects.
 Archetypes include:" Volcanic ", " Flamvell ", " Laval ", " Jurrac ", " Evol ", " Horus the Black Flame Dragon ", " Fire Fist ", " Hazy ", " Fire King ", " Shiranui ", " Battlin' Boxer ", " Infernoid ", " Igknight ", " Metalfoes " and " Salamangreat ".
 Notable users of FIRE monsters in the anime include  Axel Brodie  in  Yu-Gi-Oh! GX ,  Alito  in  Yu-Gi-Oh! ZEXAL ,  Skip Boyle  in  Yu-Gi-Oh Arc-V ,  Theodore Hamilton  in  Yu-Gi-Oh! VRAINS   Menzaburo Oomori  and  Yuka Goha  in  Yu-gi-oh Sevens. 
 
 Supporting Cards 
 Notable support cards for this Attribute include " UFO Turtle ", " Spiritual Fire Art - Kurenai ", " Rekindling ", " Brotherhood of the Fire Fist - Lion Emperor ", " Blaster, Dragon Ruler of Infernos " and " Sealing Ceremony of Katon ".
 
 Weaknesses 
 Though FIRE monsters can be extremely powerful, they tend to lack support for one another. Instead of focusing on combining and drawing on their strengths as a whole, coupled with the fact that there are few good Spell and Trap Cards to suit them than some of the other Attributes, FIRE monsters can be seen as having a negative impact on the opponent.
