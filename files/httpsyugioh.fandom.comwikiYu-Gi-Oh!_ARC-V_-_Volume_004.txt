However, during the duel, Yuto transforms into Yuya, who wins and escapes. Yuzu Hiragi, who happens to be present at the Duel, becomes Yuya's manager and joins him in pursuit of the Genesis Omega Dragon (G.O.D.)

 A new enemy bars Yuya's way. What is Eve's goal? The mystery is reaching its climax! But my personal enemy is "Yu-Gi-Oh! Duel Links". I'm way too absorbed in that game! [2] 
 
 Message from Naohito Miyoshi 
 At Jump Victory Carnaval in Osaka, lots of people cheered for me and gave me encouraging letters. I'm exhausted, but I'll keep doing my best! I'll eat myself out of house and home and get some power into my system! "Yu-Gi-Oh! ARC-V" is going full speed ahead!! [2] 
 
 Message from Masahiro Hikokubo 
 When they make original cards from the manga into official game cards, it makes me so happy! Ren's White monsters are already showing up!! I do feel a little apologetic toward the preexisting Great White, though. [2]
