 Summary 
 The duel between Espa Roba and Joey Wheeler continues and things do not look good for Joey because Espa's " Jinzo " has 2400  ATK  and prevents Joey from using  Trap Cards . All of Joey's attempts to destroy "Jinzo" fail and he is on the brink of giving up. Back in the hospital, Tristan lies to Serenity about the Duel, saying that Joey is winning when in fact, he is not. When a nurse comes in to examine Serenity, Tristan leaves the room and decides to call Tea, who is at the park with Solomon Muto. Tristan returns to Serenity's room, who now knows the real status of the duel. She asked the nurse to look at the laptop and tell her what was going on while Tristan was out. Tristan apologizes for lying to Serenity and the two start cheering for Joey.
 Back at the Duel, Espa's "Jinzo" and " Reflect Bounder " destroy two of Joey's " Sheep Tokens ", leaving him with just two more before he becomes wide open for a direct attack. Joey doesn't look too good, but Tea and Solomon arrive and tell him that Tristan called from the hospital to say that he and Serenity are watching the duel on the Internet. Tea says they all believe in him, encouraging Joey to fight on. 
 Joey activates " Roulette Spider " and with sheer luck, he ends up winning the Duel. Everyone cheers, except for Espa, who falls down in defeat. Joey tells him that was a good Duel and tells him to hand over his Locator Card and his "Jinzo" as that's the rules. Espa however acts like a sore loser and pleads him to not to make him do so as his brothers are counting him constantly to protect them. Espa reveals that if the public knows he is a loser, they will be picked on by bullies and he won't be able to help them. Joey tries to help him, but Espa slaps Joey away, revealing the earpiece that he was using to communicate with his brothers. 
 Just then, the other Roba brothers arrive and they reveal to Espa that they are proud of him for doing his best and almost winning, even without cheating. Espa stands up and gives his brothers a hug. Later Espa hands over his "Jinzo" and  Locator Card  to Joey and promises he will not cheat again. Joey accepts it, says "Smell you later" to the Roba brothers, and walks off with Tea and Solomon, knowing that he has won his first duel, but there are plenty more challenges ahead of him. However, he knows he will not be alone.
 
 Featured Duel: Joey Wheeler vs. Espa Roba - Part 2 
 Duel continued from previous episode. 
 Joey  has 2600  LP  remaining and  controls  " Alligator's Sword " (1500/1200) in Attack Position.
 Espa Roba  has 1440 LP remaining and controls " Jinzo " (2400/1500) in Attack Position.
 Turn 8: Espa 
 Espa  has just managed to summon " Jinzo ". He then  activates  " Amplifier ",  equipping  it to "Jinzo" and increasing its  ATK  by 500 ("Jinzo": 2400 → 2900/1500). Also "Amplifier" will increase the ATK of "Jinzo" by 300 during each of Espa's Standby Phases. "Jinzo"  attacks  and  destroys  " Alligator's Sword " ( Joey  2600 LP → 1200 LP).
 Turn 9: Joey 
 Joey  draws " Baby Dragon " and subsequently Normal Summons it (1200/700) in  Attack Position . Joey then  activates  " Time Wizard " as a Magic Card. He then activates the effect of "Time Wizard". Joey succeeds in the effect, so "Baby Dragon" transforms into " Thousand Dragon " (2400/2000), but " Jinzo " is unaffected by the effect of "Time Wizard". Espa explains that is because the armor of "Jinzo" can't age or corrode. "Thousand Dragon" attacks "Jinzo" before Joey realizes this. "Jinzo" destroys "Thousand Dragon" ( Joey  1200 LP → 700 LP).  Joey   activates  " Scapegoat " to  Special Summon  four " Sheep Tokens " (0/0 for all four) in  Defense Position .
 Turn 10: Espa 
Espa draws. On Espa's Standby Phase, the second effect of "Amplifier" activates ("Jinzo": 2900 → 3200/1500).  Espa  then  Normal Summons  " Reflect Bounder " (1700/1000) in  Attack Position . When this monster is attacked, both "Reflect Bounder" and the attacking monster will be destroyed after damage calculation. After that is done, the controller of the attacking monster will take all Battle Damage that Espa would have taken from the battle. "Jinzo" and "Reflect Bounder" then  attack  and  destroy  two "Sheep Tokens".
 Turn 11: Joey 
 Joey  draws " Roulette Spider " and subsequently activates it to pay half of his Life Points (Joey 700 LP → 350 LP) [Notes 1]  and target "Jinzo" (as it is the strongest monster Espa has out on the field). "Roulette Spider" then forcibly spins "Jinzo" until it randomly chooses a player or monster for "Jinzo" to attack and whatever is chosen will be attacked by "Jinzo". The effect of "Roulette Spider" chooses "Reflect Bounder" as the target for "Jinzo". "Jinzo" attacks and destroys "Reflect Bounder". Since "Reflect Bounder" was attacked by a monster, its  effect  activates,  destroying  "Jinzo" and inflicting the Battle Damage between the two battling monsters to Espa as "Jinzo" was his monster ( Espa  1440 LP → 0 LP).
 
 Epilogue 
 Joey  obtains "Jinzo" and one  Locator Card  from  Espa  as per the Battle City rules.
