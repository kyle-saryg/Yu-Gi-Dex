 Ancient Fairy Dragon's Location 
 I know that Luna doesn't have her Signer Dragon's card at the moment, but when is it shown (or stated) that the Dark Signers have the card? DinoQueen13  13:29, 26 October 2008 (UTC)
 
 At the end of  episode 19 , we see one of them's hand spinning it around. I think it might have been implied in  episode 30  too. --  Deltaneos  ( talk ) 15:37, 26 October 2008 (UTC) 
 Thats's true from story from episode 30 it is more than certain because one of the Nazca Gods, the spider actually took her along thus sealing AFD too. Mean her spirit on episode 19 said that to Luna before being blown away. So because of it I wonder if that means that their leader Rudger has it. Since he depicts having the spider mark, along with his robes being red colored as the spider was of the same color as well. Maybe coincidence though if you look at the gloved hand that spins her card, mean it looks exactly like Rudger's. with comparison of course.  User:DracoX   —Preceding undated comment added 17:37, October 26, 2008 
 Ok....this is what i think will happen luna and the rudger will duel.leo will be on the sidelines supporting her sister.rex goodwin said when a signer is in trouble the 5th signer ability will be awakened.if luna does duel rudger then leo power will be awakened.if his power arent awaked we can safely say leo ISNT the 5th signer.but i think this will happen.i really hope leo is the 5th signer  —This unsigned comment was made by  217.44.45.70  ( talk  •  contribs ) 17:02, 27 January 2009 (UTC) 
 Actually, the Ancient Fairy Dragon Card is with Demak, the man with the monkey mark. He challenges Luna to a duel, but Luna gets transported to the Spirit World, so Leo duels instead. When Leo is at the brink of destruction, Luna comes back,takes over, and wins(Thanks to Ancient Fairy Dragon, of course)  TheShadowKing   —Preceding undated comment added 20:14, 9 September 2009 (UTC) 
 
 The question had been asked months before that episode had aired. --  Deltaneos  ( talk ) 20:24, September 9, 2009 (UTC) 
 Age 
 People are saying a couple of characters ages were given in  -OZONE- , the opening for the third arc. I assume it's when all the character cards were placed on the Duel Disk? Anyway it said she was 10. That's contradictory to what we were told during the Fortune Cup, since the MC told us she was 11. Saying she's 10, would also mean, she would have been about 2 when she first visited the Spirits' World. And since more than 6 months have passed between the Fortune Cup and the third arc, she could have been 1 1/2. Okay so saying she's 10 mean she was 1 ~ 2.5 years old when she went to the spirit World. Going by the age the MC gave use, she would have been 2.5 ~ 4. The second one seems more locial to me and since 11 was the age given in the show, we know at exactly which time it's refering to. Assuming the age was given on the card (let me know if that's not the part, where the ages are given), we don't know at what point in time it is refering to. --  Deltaneos  ( talk ) 20:35, 2 July 2009 (UTC)
 
 Doesn't matter. It does say 11 on the  card  too. --  Deltaneos  ( talk ) 23:54, 5 July 2009 (UTC) 
 I know that in Yu-Gi-Oh! GX it notes that you have to be 12 to attend Duel Academy.   —This unsigned comment was made by  173.55.147.106  ( talk  •  contribs ) 00:34, 6 July 2009 (UTC) 
 When was this stated? All the students (apart from Blair) seem to be quite older than that. Obviously since this is 5D's, so it's safe to assume it can be much different than GX and Luna couldn't have had 2 birthdays in the space of just over 6 months. --  Deltaneos  ( talk ) 00:49, 6 July 2009 (UTC) 
 the episode that started the WGRP skipped forward a year so she should be 12 now.  —This unsigned comment was made by  174.21.171.57  ( talk  •  contribs ) 18:04, 21 April 2010 (UTC) 
 That doesn't address the card  Leo / Luna  giving her a different age than the MC. We now have a clearer version of the image and can see that it does indeed say 10. The MC said that she was 11 during the Fortune Cup. It's possible the card is referring to an earlier date, but  Aki's card  says that she is 17, while her age during the Fortune Cup was said to be 16, suggesting that the cards use a later date. --  Deltaneos  ( talk ) 19:31, April 21, 2010 (UTC) 
 So now I am thinking that they had birthday in between of Fortune Cup and Dark Signer, and they however skipped it due to Dark Signer's attack. -- FredCat100  19:32, April 21, 2010 (UTC)

 is there any way to stop someone from constantly changing the page if the change is the same thing and it its incorrect (changing age from 11 to 666)  Sonic0chick0ames  17:48, 17 August 2009 (UTC)
 The only way to forbid a user from editing is by blocking them,but only administrators can do that. PoirotH  17:51, 17 August 2009 (UTC)
 who are the admins? because if he/she does it again ill report them  Sonic0chick0ames  17:52, 17 August 2009 (UTC)
 Deltaneos is an admin (see above). I know, it is annoying when I see it on pages. I doubt it is anything other than spam, but did you try disscussing it on his user page? -- Qim1  20:20, 17 August 2009 (UTC)

 The Twins' Parents 
 Do you think we should have an article for Leo and Luna's parents? There is enough info about them and also is the episode Return to the Spirit World there's a picture of them, even though it does not show their faces. I mean, it seems reasonable because there is even an article for Yusei's mom.  —This unsigned comment was made by  66.75.81.157  ( talk  •  contribs ) 13:56, November 10, 2010

 Well Yusei's father is more in the series than Yusei's mom, Yusei's mom shows up as much or less than the twins parents do...hence why I think there should be an article for them.  —This unsigned comment was made by  66.75.81.157  ( talk  •  contribs ) 05:28, November 11, 2010

 Psychic Duelist? 
 Is Luna a psychic duelist? She doesn't have powers like Sayer or Akiza, but still possesses a unique power while dueling. so is she or isn't she, and if she is, shouldn't we add that?  —This unsigned comment was made by  66.75.81.157  ( talk  •  contribs ) 04:36, November 30, 2010 
 Also, we should have a section for her called "abilities" like there is for Bruno and Lucciano.  —This unsigned comment was made by  66.75.81.157  ( talk  •  contribs ) 04:38, November 30, 2010

 Leo and Luna's relationship. 
 Hey Cheesedude, I was wondering if we could go ahead and put in Luna's bio in the relationship section of Leo, that it's hinted in (insert episodes, and Japanese versions only, because the dub cut out the hints) that she may have feelings for Leo (though her hints are subtle). What do you think we can do (the hints are below, and it is very long so I had to seperate them)? 
 Don't get me wrong, It's not like we support incest in real life, but this stuff was hinted on the show, and should be mentioned. Another thing, if they were not giving some kind of hint on Ruka's side in both episodes 143 and 152, they would not have made her look at Rua with a look that is easily infatuation (it is to be noted she did not look at even Lucciano with such a look, yes she was happy Rua was alive, but the fact remains that she did look at him with an infatuated look) in episode 143, or had her blush after Rua turned away flustered in 152 (remember blushes are always brief when it comes to the world of anime, and ussually hint at the characters liking each other). 
 In episode 154 there is a scene in the time-skip that hints her feelings(it is very subtle though, so most could overlook it). A couple of guys blush at Ruka and stare at her, but she doesn't even so much as glance at them, and keeps her focus on Rua(which does seem to imply that she only has feelings for Rua, or they did confess, but are keeping their relationship a secret). Another hint in that episode that is overlooked is that Ruka gives Rua a lot of unusual praise, she says how much Rua changed at least 3 times in a row, and even says "You're more of a man now" she never even reffered to Lucciano as "A man", and she all of a sudden called Rua "Onii-chan" which means big brother.
 Here is one of the very hard to notice hints (though this one is a bit debatable). In episode 78 when the Crimson Dragon saves Rua, Ruka says something like "What was that feeling that I felt from my heart" as she thinks this, she has her hand cluched where her heart is, which seems to hint that she is developing feelings for Rua, or she does but doesn't know it (the dub version completely changed her dialog and hint). 
 Episode 70 is the most subtle/hard to spot hint. When she get's lost she calls Tenpie and Rua's name. Now when she is about to be attacked by the evil spirits, she calls Rua's name(note she doesn't call Tenpie this time) and then closes her eyes and begs for Rua to come save her (see what I mean, her hints are very subtle so most probably did not notice them, It's not like Rua's hints, which were flat-out obvious). The dub version changed her dialog and hint, and made her say "Leo, Dexter, someone please help me". 
 What do you think, do I have enough hints to put this in her biograghy relationship section of Leo? And what do you think of any of this? Shardsilver ( talk  •  contribs ) 19:10, August 18, 2011 (UTC)
 
 Once again, I would go ahead and add it, just be sure to reference it as well. Cheesedude  ( talk  •  contribs ) 19:40, August, 18 2011 (UTC) 
 I don't think the scene with her taking no notice of the boys starting at her meant she was attracted to her brother. If you're not attracted to someone in particular it doesn't mean you have to consider every person that stares at you, especially if you are attractive enough to have that many people interested in you. I don't think she had much choice but to be focused on her brother afterwards, since she was just talking to him and the girls she met started talking about him. 
 Her getting embarrassed by her friends talking how attractive he is doesn't necessarily mean she is attracted in him. I see this situation often on TV and in real life. If someone has a sibling of the opposite sex and that person's friends start talking about how sexy the sibling is in front of them, the normal reaction is to either tell them off or get embarrassed. 
 I don't think there's anything romantic about complimenting her brother in that episode. It was her proud of how much her brother has grown-up. Granted it's not very common to hear a sister tell a brother of equal age that she's proud of how much he's grown-up, but it's not common for a girlfriend to say that to a boyfriend either. It's more like something parents would say to their children. However their parents are never around, so the twins help each other grow-up. Similarly in Death T-3, Yugi, Anzu, Jonouchi and Honda all talked together about how they'd grown-up, but they weren't all romantically interested in one another. 
 The heart is associated with love of any kind. Parents can love their children, teachers can love their students, friends can love each other and sisters can love brothers all without being physically attracted to them. And the heart is often used in association with this kind of love. I don't think her feeling something in her heart extended beyond this. 
 I'm pretty sure there was one point where Luca said that she has always relied on her brother to save her. Her brother has saved her multiple times before and she knows him better than she knows Tenpei, so it's more likely that she'd want or expect Lua's help. IIRC, Tenpei is Lua's friend and Luca knows him through Lua. It might be politically incorrect, but not outright incorrect to say that Luca likes Lua more than she likes Tenpei. But not in a romantic way. 
 Episode 152  where  Luca shows Lua her new clothes  is actually quite suggestive of the point you're making. And looking at the odd filename of the linked image would imply I agree with you. I haven't rechecked the scene, so correct me if I'm remembering it wrong. Wasn't it only Lua who blushed, while Luca was just happy that he liked the look? If so, this is more of a point in favour of Lua likes Luca than vice versa. My interpretation of the scene was Lua realized that his sister is a beautiful girl, which is an embarrassing thing for any brother to admit, which is why he blushed. It doesn't necessarily mean he's attracted to her though. Heterosexual people can think people of the same gender are good-looking without being attracted to them. The same can apply for relatives of opposite genders or really anyone of any gender or sexual orientation. 
 All-in-all, I think there are times when characters are definitely attracted to each other and there are times when it's not so obvious and open to fan interpretation. This seems to fit into the second. I think if you asked the writers if the twins are attracted to each other, the answer would either be "no" or they wouldn't give a straight answer. I strongly doubt they'd give a straight "yes". A "no" would obviously mean they're not attracted to each other. A non-straight answer would mean the writers deliberately left it debatable. --  Deltaneos  ( talk ) 14:02, August 19, 2011 (UTC) 
 No, Ruka did blush after Rua turns away in episode 152 (you have to look very closely, but she did blush). Lastly while I do respect your opinion, the fact is that if they were not giving some kind of a hint on ether side, they would not have made Rua blush (the fact that they're twins matters in that scene, because if Rua didn't like Ruka more than a brother and it was just her new look, then it would have been like seeing himself in a girls outfit only, which we know was clearly not the case) or get jealous of the affection Ruka gave the new guy in episode 77, which was very obvious to everyone who watched it(I don't need to explain Ruka's hints again). Remember characters do not have to say they like each other (even before Aki tried to tell Yusei how she feels, the fact that it was hinted she may like Yusei was still in her biograghy). So like Aki's hints it still should be mentioned, because this stuff was hinted on the show. Also as I said, Ruka's hints are not like Rua's, they're subtle, and hard to notice unless you pay close attention. Shardsilver  ( talk  •  contribs ) 14:11, August 19, 2011 (UTC)
 I'd like to argue in episode 78, I don't think that feeling in her heart was a hint to the Rua/Ruka pairing - she described it more as a "jolt" in her heart, and this happened when the Crimson Dragon saved Rua. I think it was slight foreshadowing Rua would become the HEART Signer, not that Ruka had a crush on him. Because in the episode where Rua actually got his mark, if I remember, she felt that jolt in her heart again when he became a Signer?  —This unsigned comment was made by  66.75.81.157  ( talk  •  contribs ) September 22, 2011 
 Please sign your post so we know who were talking to. I did say "Some however believe It's just sisterly affection (both sides are debatable)" therefore any of the hints can be taken ether way (some consider it a hint, while some don't). No she did not feel that joy at the time (her heart was giving out because Rua died right in-front of her, and it was too much for her to take). After Lifestream Dragon healed the team, that's when Ruka was happy (and she did have a slight infatuated look)  Shardsilver  ( talk  •  contribs ) 20:19, September 22, 2011 (UTC)
 Copied from Leo's talk page because 67.85.70.47 brought up we should mention the same for Luna. 
 Alright I think we can come to an agreement, that both sides are carried out equally (Like you said "67.85.70.47"). What if we said "It is hinted in episodes 70, 78, 143, 152, and 154 (Japanese versions only) that she may have feelings for his Leo (It is to be noted however, that her hints are subtle). Some however believe that it is just sisterly affection (both sides are debatable)"? This way nothing is changed, and both points of view are carried out equally.  Shardsilver  ( talk  •  contribs ) 18:05, August 27, 2011 (UTC)
 Ok fine, I can go with that ^.  —This unsigned comment was made by  67.85.70.47  ( talk  •  contribs ) 19:50, August 27, 2011 
 Copyed from Deltaneos page (Luna's draft onwards).
 
 After Leo was blown off the circut, and was saved, Luna put a hand on her heart thinking "But what was that, that feeling I felt from my heart?" (the dub drasticaly changed her words to "Thank goodness for the Crimson Dragon, he'll always save the day"). (Insert episode 78 reference). 
 After Leo awakened as a Signer, she cried tears of joy, saying he was her hero. As she said that, she had a slight infatuated look (It's to be pointed out, that she never looked at even Lester with such a look). This can however simply be taken as her being happy that her brother was alive. (Insert episode 143 reference). 
 As the gang were preparing to part ways, Luna said how much Leo has changed, even going so far as to say "You're more of a man now", and "Onii-chan" (Big brother in the Japanese). Interestingly, she has not reffered to anyone (including Lester) as "A man". (Insert episode 154 reference).  Shardsilver  ( talk  •  contribs ) 22:53, December 29, 2011 (UTC) 
 Um, I may need Deltaneos to soften that up for me first... lol -- Golden Key  ( talk  •  contribs ) 23:09, December 29, 2011 (UTC) 
 Like with "It's to be noted", I think "It's to be pointed out" and "Interestingly" at the beginning of sentences in articles are superfluous. I don't think the brackets around the two mentions of Lester are necessary either. Although, does Lester need to be mentioned in those two cases? --  Deltaneos  ( talk ) 18:05, December 30, 2011 (UTC) 
 What about "As she said that, she had a slight infatuated look, and her eyes were glazing at him. This can however simply be taken as her being very happy that her brother was alive", and "Until now, she had not reffered to anyone as "A man", or called Leo "Onii-chan"?  Shardsilver  ( talk  •  contribs ) 18:25, December 30, 2011 (UTC) 
 I honestly cannot find a sub of 78 anywhere. But after reading both your comments and re-watching episode 143, this is what I've come up with for the other two: 
 After Leo awakens as a Signer, Luna cries tears of joy, calling him her hero while looking at him adoringly.<ref>{{episode|Yu-Gi-Oh!|143|ref}} 
</ref> As the gang prepares to part ways, Luna comments on how much Leo has changed, stating that he's a man now and referring to him as "big brother".<ref>{{episode|Yu-Gi-Oh!|154|ref}}</ref> -- Golden Key  ( talk  •  contribs ) 03:31, December 31, 2011 (UTC)

 Lucciano in the Relationships Section? 
 Just mention how it was implied Ruka had something of a crush on Lucciano before she knew he was evil, and how she showed pity for him when they found out how his parents died? Just a thought.  —This unsigned comment was made by  66.75.81.157  ( talk  •  contribs ) 19:04, August 30, 2011 
 Luna didn't actually pity Lester when she found out his parents died, she was just shocked (remember Lester is nothing but a piece of Aporia's embodiments, Lester is Aporia in his young age, Primo is Aporia's teen years, and Jakob is Aporia's old age). Also after Luna found out it was Lester they were dueling, she displayed some hatred towards him, and even said after Lester almost killed Leo right of her "Who'd be defeated by the likes of you" so it was a very short-lived crush. Still I think we should put that in her relationship section, because she technicaly (without knowing it) had a small crush on him (she showed every sign of having a crush).

 Added 'Jack' to relationships 
 I hope no-one minds, but I added Jack to Luna's relationships, is that okay?  —This unsigned comment was made by  31.185.159.210  ( talk  •  contribs ) 22:30, November 17, 2011 
 Sign your post so we know who were speaking to. I don't see why not. Truthfully Ruka/Luna has been shown to cheer Jack on just as much as Rua/Leo (Which you stated). It's not as noticable as Rua/Leo (Which you also put), but we have seen that she has a certain level of respect and admiration for the guy (Shown for Example: Jacks fight with Team new World and Team Ragnerock). What you put looks pretty good.  Shardsilver  ( talk  •  contribs ) 23:01, November 17, 2011 (UTC)
 
 Lead paragraph 
 "Unlike her brother, Luna does not seem to understand romance and crushes very well." I'm not sure what exactly that is supposed to mean."  Cheesedude  ( talk  •  contribs ) 21:09, June 16, 2012 (UTC)
 
 Luna is slowly on understand of what Romance is meaning. Like her brother, she's being home-schooled till Yusei crashed into their party. Though, with an evidence I can see from the Show/Manga (latter don't do any better), Leo read the comic that helped him to realize the romance. Apologize if I am clumsy on the explain. -- i F r e d C a t  21:13, June 16, 2012 (UTC) 
 Shall we just remove the sentence, then? It's got "references", but isn't worth noting in the article, let alone the lead paragraph. -- Golden Key  ( talk  •  contribs ) 22:03, June 16, 2012 (UTC) 
 You're welcome to remove it, Goldy. -- i F r e d C a t  22:49, June 16, 2012 (UTC) 
 I think it's important to leave it, because most people get it backwards when comes to one of the twins knowing more about romance than the other one does. Almost everywhere I go people act as though Leo is oblivious to Akiza having a crush on Yusei, while Luna easily sees it. However, Leo was the only one who noticed Akiza getting jealous of Yusei spending time with Bruno, while Luna just looked on in confusion.
 By the way FredCat, what comic are you talking about? I never once seen Leo read a comic. 72.223.49.77  ( talk ) 23:26, June 16, 2012 (UTC)
 
 There were some point before Leo got running into one of worst teams;  Team Taiyo  - he was seen reading the comic/manga. That would be an evidence - but of course, it's not possible. It's in episode 118 though. -- i F r e d C a t  23:45, June 16, 2012 (UTC) 
 That was a magazine about the WRGP (it even had WRGP as part of the title on the cover). It had nothing to do with romance at all. 72.223.49.77  ( talk ) 00:33, June 17, 2012 (UTC))
 
 Ok, but still it's an  evidence , so let's get back on the topic please. -- i F r e d C a t  00:37, June 17, 2012 (UTC) 
 Reworded, I have no problem with it being kept. But I really don't think its lead paragraph material.  Cheesedude  ( talk  •  contribs ) 03:39, June 17, 2012 (UTC) 
 I don't see why her (in)ability to detect romance is notable. Somehow it even comes before mentioning what her Signer mark is? -- Golden Key  ( talk  •  contribs ) 03:51, June 17, 2012 (UTC) 
 I already explained why it should be notable. I said that most people get it backwards when comes to one of the twins knowing more about romance than the other one does. If your guys' biggest concern is the placement of it, then why not simply put it in the second paragraph instead of the first? 72.223.49.77  ( talk ) 13:28, June 17, 2012 (UTC)
