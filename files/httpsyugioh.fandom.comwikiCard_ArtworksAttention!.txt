 The  Goblin Calligrapher  in this card's International artwork is redrawn in a different location, specifically, "above" the explosion, perhaps to make the artwork appear less violent (in this case, perhaps to make it look like the explosion's momentum flung "Goblin Calligrapher" into the air instead of "killing" it.)
