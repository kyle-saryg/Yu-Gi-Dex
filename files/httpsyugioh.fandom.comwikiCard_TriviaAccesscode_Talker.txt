 This monster is the  cover card  of  Eternity Code . 
 This is the final monster that debuted in the  Yu-Gi-Oh! VRAINS  anime.
 It is also the last monster to be  Link Summoned  in the series and used by  Yusaku Fujiki . 
 This card's name is a reference to Playmaker's  Skill , Storm Access.
 The "seize the wind" part of its  summon chant  is also a reference to  Ai 's catchphrase whenever Playmaker uses Storm Access to obtain a new  Link Monster . 
 This card has the following distinctions from the other " Code Talker " monsters:
 It is the only member with 2300  ATK  not to be a  Link-3  monster, instead being a  Link-4  monster.
 Coincidentally, its  Link Arrows  are that of the combined  Link-2  members " Code Talker " and " Code Talker Inverted ". 
 It is the only member to not have any effects that involve the position of the monsters it points to. 
 This card's Link Arrows share the same position as Playmaker's other Link-4 monster, " Firewall Dragon ". 
 This card appears to represent the bond between Yusaku and his  Ignis  partner,  Ai .
