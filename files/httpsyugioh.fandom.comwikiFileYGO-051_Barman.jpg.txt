 Biography 
 The barman met  Yugi ,  Joey ,  Anzu  and  Hiroto  when they arrived at the village looking for information. Claiming to be adventurers, Joey asked him how they could earn gold. The barman sighed and said "If money could solve our problems, I'd give you all I've got... but before you could claim your reward, you'd be dead!" before moving away. However Joey insisted on hearing what the problem what was, so the barman told him how the village was once peaceful until  Zorc  assassinated the king, turned his castle into a den of evil and terrorized the area with monsters. The barman then instructed the party to speak with " Villager D " to get directions to  Zorc Castle .
