 Biography 
       Apollo and  Diana   activating  the same card in their respective Duels.     
 When  Yugo  arrived at the top of the tower, Apollo told Yugo to Duel if he wanted to rescue  Rin . He  Fusion Summoned  " Luminous Keeper " and  activated  its  effect  to  Special Summon  a " Keeper Shield Token ". When Yugo brought out " Clear Wing Synchro Dragon ", Apollo activated " Admiration of the Keepers " to  negate  its  effects , Special Summon two "Keeper Shield Tokens", and force "Clear Wing" to attack all "Keeper Shield Tokens" or be  destroyed  at the end of the  Battle Phase . When Yugo destroyed all "Keeper Shield Tokens", Apollo activated the effect of "Luminous Keeper" to decrease the  ATK  of "Clear Wing" and Yugo's  LP  by 800 for each destroyed Token. As Apollo reduced the ATK of "Clear Wing" to 100, he wondered if there was any point for it on the  field  until Yugo brought out " Crystal Wing Synchro Dragon ". He was then defeated when Yugo used a combination of " Speedroid Gum Prize " and the effect of "Crystal Wing" to increase its ATK to destroy "Luminous Keeper". [1] 
 When Yugo and Rin exited the tower, Apollo was still unconscious on the ground. [2] 
 
 Deck 
 Apollo uses a Deck centered on  Fusion Summoning  " Luminous Keeper ". His strategy revolves around creating " Keeper Shield Token " through the  effects  of "Luminous Keeper" and " Admiration of the Keepers " which keeps "Luminous Keeper" from being  destroyed . With "Admiration of the Keepers" he's capable of nullifying his opponent's ace  monsters  effects while forcing them to  attack  the "Shield Tokens" or risk getting that monster destroyed, which causes the opponent's monster to get substantially weaker with each attack, while also inflicting  effect damage .

 Trivia 
 In  Greek mythology ,  Apollo  is one of the twelve Olympians, and the god of the light and sun. 
 His Duel with  Yugo  is likely a reference to  Yusei Fudo 's  Turbo Duel  vs.  Vizor  on an artificial space featuring the Sun.
