      Yugi playing Sock Concentration.     
 Sock Concentration  is a game  Yugi Mutou  made to train his sixth sense for gaming.
 It is based on the card game,  concentration , but uses socks instead of cards. Yugi drew symbols on one side of lots of identical white socks. He mixed them-up and spread them on the floor. He then tried using his sixth sense to turn over socks with matching symbols.
 Yugi's mother  was unimpressed when he explained the game to her, when she found him playing it when he should be getting ready for school and walloped him with a ladle across the back of the head.
