 " Gyakutenno Megami " appears in this card's artwork.
 This card's effect granting Life Points to player could be a reference to the lore of "Gyakutenno Megami" : "This fairy uses her mystical power to protect the weak and provide spiritual support." 
 This card also used to be the only card in the TCG to display a full body view of “Gyakutenno Megami”, as only her head was visible in her card artworks prior, until the release of her retrained counterpart “ Goddess of Sweet Revenge ”. 
 In Greek mythology, Aegis is the shield used by the Greek goddess Athena, with the bronzed head of the Gorgon Medusa in the middle. In description, it is a large collar or cape worn in ancient times to display the protection provided by a high religious authority. 
 Gaia  is the personification of the Earth and one of the Greek primordial deities.
