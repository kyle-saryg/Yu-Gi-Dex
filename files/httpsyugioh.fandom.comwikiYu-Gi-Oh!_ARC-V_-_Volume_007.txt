 Solid Vision with mass has plunged the world into the era of Action Duels. Yuya Sakaki is a Dueltainer who has come to this time in search of the Genesis Omega Dragon (G.O.D.). Reiji Akaba, who is pursuing Yuya and G.O.D., has also arrived shortly before Yuya. Having become the president of the Leo Corporation, he sends his company's Duelist—Sawatari, Kurosaki and Sora—after Yuya. Finally, Yuya and Akada finally face off in person. However, a masked man named Ren interrupts their Duel. This plunges them into a three-way battle with Eve's group for control of G.O.D. Having found and infiltrated the group's main base, Yuya finally gets a chance to Duel Eve. However, before they can finish their battle, G.O.D. awakens. Does Yuya still have a shot at victory?! [2]

 Afterword 
 I'd like to use this space to say a great big thank you to everyone who loves "Yu-Gi-Oh!" and has supported this series! Thank you very much! "Yu-Gi-Oh!" has introduced me to many people and provided me with many new experiences. I feel proud and lucky to have been able to work on this. "ARC=V" was limited in scale, but I think Yoshida, Hikokubo, Aikawa and the rest of the production staff managed to successfully create their own unique brand of entertainment. I owe them and you many years' worth of thanks, I hope that you get a card that brings you good luck. 
 Ladies and gentlemen! Remember! 
 The fun's just getting started! 
 Naohito Miyoshi, July 2019
