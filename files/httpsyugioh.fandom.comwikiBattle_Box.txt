 A  Battle Box  is a small, clear box that surrounds a table and two chairs. It is used to play Duel Monsters in the  Death-T  and  Duelist Kingdom  arcs in the manga and Toei anime (the latter of which adapted Death-T), created by  Seto Kaiba . Any card played inside the Battle Box is brought to life with holographic technology. These devices were invented by Industrial Illusions, Inc. and were later replaced by the  Duel Disk ,  KaibaCorp 's invention in  Battle City .
 In the 2000's anime, which exclusively adapted the Duelist Kingdom arc,  Seto Kaiba  invented  Dueling Arenas  instead.  Zigfried von Schroeder  invented something similar to Battle Boxes, but before he could present his idea to  Maximillion Pegasus , Kaiba had already made a business deal with Pegasus to produce the Dueling Arenas.
