 This section, or a part of it, has been transcluded from  Yu-Gi-Oh! GX - Volume 001 ; any changes involving it should be made  there  instead.  /  
 Years after Yugi's legendary battles, the game is so popular that special institutions dedicated to the art of the Duel have sprung up all over the world. Join Jaden Yuki and his pals at the Academy for the adventures of the next generation of "Yu-Gi-Oh!" [1] 
 The Semifinals Begin!! 
 The Duel Academy tournament has reached the semifinal round, with the winner getting a chance to take on duel champion Zane "Kaiser" Truesdale. Jaden and Bastion go head to head in an all-out match, followed by Chazz taking on the mysterious David Rabb. The winners of these two matches will face off in the final round of the tournament! But will David Rabb's evil master plan ruin everything? [2] 
 
 The Story So Far 
 On an island in the southern sea there is an academy that trains the next generation of duelists—the Duel Academy! 
 Jaden Yuki learned about the excitement of dueling through an encounter with the World Dueling Champion, Koyo Hibiki. Entrusted with Hibiki's deck, Jaden takes on all challengers at the Academy in order to become a true duelist! 
 Syrus's older brother Zane, aka Kaiser, the top-ranked duelist, has returned from America and a tournament is being held at the Academy to win the right to challenge him. Jaden and the others, including some exchange students from America, have battled through the preliminaries, and the duelists that will compete in the semi-finals have been decided. David secretly covets a special card to one of them…! [2] 
 
 In the Next Volume… 
 The ultimate hero vs. the ultimate dragon! Jaden and Chazz go head to head in the semifinals for the right to fight Kaiser—and to prove once and for all who is the better Duelist! Meanwhile, Ms. Hibiki confronts Reggie about the mysterious "spirit card," her brother's condition, and Reggie's real reason for coming to Duel Academy. In response, Reggie challenges Ms. Hibiki to a secret Shadow Game…in an abandoned corner of the Academy, where no one can hear you scream!

 Message from Kazuki Takahashi 
 Lately I've really enjoyed drawing color illustrations and sticking them up in front of my computer. I'll work hard and show them to you soon. [2] 
 
 Message from Naoyuki Kageyama 
 The  "Yu-Gi-Oh! GX"  chapters used to be 21 pages long, but now they're 31 pages long. Althought the extra pages make it harder to finish all the work, I can use bigger panels to make the scenes more energetic. I'll do my best to continue drawing manga that entertains you. [2]
