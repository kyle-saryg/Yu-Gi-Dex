 Biography 
 The Grim Reaper was deemed too dangerous and was therefore locked away in  North Academy , but  Lucien Grimley  stole the card, looking for any kind of help to win Duels. The Reaper agreed to grant Lucien victory in his Duels in exchange for his soul, and he readily accepted. However, he was found by  Jaden Yuki ,  Chazz Princeton ,  Syrus Truesdale , and  Tyranno Hassleberry  during the  Genex Tournament  at  Duel Academy . Chazz tried to prevent the card from escaping by having the spirits of  Ojama Yellow ,  Ojama Green  and  Ojama Black  guard it. However, the card took control of  Vellian Crowler  and made him give it to Lucien. He then proceeded to Duel Jaden, where he learned that Lucien sold his soul to the Grim Reaper so he can obtain powerful draw power as he couldn't believe in his Deck. Jaden was able to convince Lucien to fight off the Reaper's power and he threw the card away before it could do any more harm to him.
