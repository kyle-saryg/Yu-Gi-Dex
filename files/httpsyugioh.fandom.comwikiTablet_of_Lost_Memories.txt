        Tablet of Lost Memories     
 The  Tablet of Lost Memories  (" Memory Tablet " in Japanese) is an Ancient Egyptian Tablet built by  Priest Seto  as symbol of his friendship with  Pharaoh Atem  in  Yu-Gi-Oh!  series.
 
 Appearances 
 The tablet is first introduced in the  Yu-Gi-Oh!  series during the  Battle City  arc, when  Ishizu Ishtar  brings it to the  Domino City  museum. It is observed by  Seto Kaiba  as Ishizu explains the ancient battle between his and Yugi's past lives. It is later seen by  Yami Yugi  accompanied by TÃ©a where Ishizu appears and explains that if Yami is to regain his memories he must obtain the three  Egyptian Gods  as well as the seven Millennium items and bring them to the tablet. 
 In the anime, after Yugi obtained them after winning the Battle City championship,  Dartz  froze the tablet in crystal and drained the power from the God cards, eventually taking them to prevent the Pharaoh from going into the past, as Dartz needed him to revive the  Great Leviathan . When Dartz was defeated the tablet was brought back to Egypt.
 The tablet is a very important item during the  Pharaoh's Memories arc , when it is used by  Yami Yugi  (and  Yami Bakura ) to travel to the  World of Memories  to remember  himself .

 On the left side,  Priest Seto ; on the right side,  Pharaoh Atem . They seem to be involved in an ancient Duel, as seen in a vision by Ishizu. However, presumably because of the  Dark RPG , the battle was slightly changed during the Pharaoh's Memories arc.
