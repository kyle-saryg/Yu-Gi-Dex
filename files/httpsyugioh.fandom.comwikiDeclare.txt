 To  declare  ( 宣 言   Sengen ) is to announce a  attack  or to choose a property as part of a  cost  or  card effect .
 
 Attack declaration 
 A player declares an  attack  by  targeting  an opponent's monster or announcing that the monster will perform a  direct attack . This can only be performed during an open  game state  during the  Battle Phase , and doing so automatically starts the  Battle Step .
 If a  replay  occurs, targeting a monster during the replay is not considered declaring an attack. Even if the monster's attack is  negated  or cancelled due to a replay, it is still considered to have declared an attack.
 
 Property declaration 
 Some  costs  and  card effects  require player to declare a card property or the result of a  die roll . Properties that are declared for costs and/or card effects include card name,  card type ,  Type ,  Attribute ,  Level , and  Extra Deck   monster  type.
 If a player is required to declare a card name, in place of declaring a full card name a precise description of a card's stats, appearance, and/or effects is considered acceptable as long as both players are in clear agreement over which card is being described. [1]  Likewise, for different cards with homophonic names, such as " Rai-Mei " and " Raimei ", the player must make it clear which card they are referring to when declaring the card name. [2] 
 When declaring a card name, only the names of existing cards in that game (the  TCG  or  OCG ) can be declared; cards that cannot be used in an official Duel (i.e. cards with  limitation text  and  non-game cards ) cannot be declared. [3]  A player cannot declare the name of a  Token Monster [4]  or a card that's name is  always treated as a different name  rather than their own name (so " Cyber Harpie Lady " cannot be declared, but " Neo-Spacian Twinkle Moss " or " Proto-Cyber Dragon " can be). [5]  A player can declare the name of a  Forbidden  card. [6] 
 Likewise, when declaring a  Type  or  Attribute , only Types/Attributes that exist in that game (the  TCG  or  OCG ) can be declared. [7]
