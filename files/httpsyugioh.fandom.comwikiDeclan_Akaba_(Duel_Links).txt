 Description 
 Though Declan is only 16 years old, this professional Duelist has been running Leo Corporation and the Leo Institute of Dueling (LID) as their president. As one of the select few who know about the existence of other dimensions, he forms the Lancers to protect this world from interdimensional invaders. He not only uses powerful Fiend-Type D/D and D/D/D monsters in his deck, he may be the only Duelist who has mastered four summoning methods: Fusion, Synchro, Xyz, and Pendulum.
