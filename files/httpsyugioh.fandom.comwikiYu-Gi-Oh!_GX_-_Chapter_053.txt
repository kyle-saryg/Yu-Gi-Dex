 Aster Duels Again...!

 Looming... Darkness! 
 
 "The Menace of the Vision Heroes!"  is the fifty-third chapter of the  Yu-Gi-Oh! GX  manga . It was first printed in Japanese in the  V Jump  magazine and in English in the  Shonen Jump  magazine. Both of which were printed in  volume 8  of the  Yu-Gi-Oh! GX  graphic novels afterwards.
 Aster  continues his  Duel  with  Atticus . Though Aster gains an early lead, Atticus makes a strong comeback by  swarming  the  field  with " Spheres " to Summon his ace monster, " The Atmosphere ". Aster prevents some of the damage done and makes his own comeback with " Vision Hero Trinity ".
 
 Summary 
 Atticus  manages to Summon " The Atmosphere ", but  Aster  is able to use  Trap Cards  to reduce the damage done to him. Aster comments that Dueling Atticus leaves no room for breathing room - just as it was years ago. Atticus counters with " Troposphere ", and attempts to avoid damaging Aster further until he can deplete his  Life Points  all at once. In this way, Aster would be prevented from moving his " Vision Heroes " to his  Spell & Trap Card Zone . Aster counters this by changing the attack  target  to an  Attack Position  "Vision Hero". Aster is ultimately able to  Fusion Summon  " Vision Hero Trinity " and defeat Atticus. Both  Adrian  and  Principal MacKenzie  watch on.
 
 Featured Duel: Aster Phoenix vs. Atticus Rhodes 
 Duel continues from  the previous chapter .
 Turn 3: Aster 
As " Virtual Sphere " was  destroyed ,  Atticus   activates  its  effect ,  Special Summoning  the  Level  4 " Synthesize Sphere " (1000/1000) from his  Graveyard . The effect of "Synthesize Sphere" activates, Special Summoning the Level 4 " Breeze Sphere " (700/1000) from his Graveyard. Atticus then activates his  face-down  " Atmospheric Transference ", Special Summoning the Level 4 " Air Sphere " (400/300) from his  Deck .  Aster  cannot  attack  due to the effect of "Air Sphere", so he  Sets  a card to end his turn.
 Turn 4: Atticus 
Atticus  Tributes  his three monsters to  Tribute Summon  " The Atmosphere " (1000/800) in Attack Position. As he Tributed three monsters to Summon it, Atticus may activate its effect - he  equips  Aster's " Vision Hero Adoration " to it, and its  ATK  and  DEF  are increased by that of "Adoration". "The Atmosphere" attacks and destroys " Vision Hero Multiply Guy " with Aster activating his  face-down  " Illusion ", halving the ATK of the "The Atmosphere" before the attacks hits (Aster 3400 → 2300). As a " Vision Hero " was destroyed, Aster activates his face-down " Apparition ", Special Summoning " Vision Hero Vyon " (1000/1200) from his Deck in  Attack Position . The effect of "Vyon" activates,  sending  " Vision Hero Increase " from Aster's Deck to the Graveyard. Atticus Sets a card.
 Turn 5: Aster 
Aster  draws  " Vision Hero Gravito ", while his  hand  contains " Polymerization " and one other card. He Summons "Gravito" (500/2000) in  Defense Position  and Sets a card.
 Turn 6: Atticus 
Atticus Tributes "The Atmosphere" to Summon " Troposphere " (2400/2000). "Troposphere" attacks "Gravito", but Aster activates his face-down " Hallucination ", changing the attack  target  to "Vyon" (Aster 2300 → 900). As Aster have taken damage, he moves the "Increase" and "Multiply Guy" in his Graveyard to his  Spell & Trap Card Zone .
 Turn 7: Aster 
Aster Tributes "Gravito" through its effect to Special Summon "Increase" (900/1100) and "Multiply Guy" (800/700) from his Spell & Trap Card Zone. The effect of "Increase" activates, Special Summoning " Vision Hero Poisoner " (900/700) from his Deck. Aster activates "Polymerization", fusing his three monsters to  Fusion Summon  " Vision Hero Trinity " (2500/2000) in Attack Position. As it was Fusion Summoned using three  Fusion Material Monsters , its ATK is doubled. "Trinity" attacks and destroys "Troposphere" (Atticus 2600 → 0).
