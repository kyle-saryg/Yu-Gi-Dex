      The connected cities.     
 The  United Lands of the Poseidon Ocean  (ポセイドン海の連合国  Poseidon-kai no Rengōkoku ) was a kingdom in the  Yu-Gi-Oh! ZEXAL  anime consisting of several islands connected via bridges. It was united by  Nash , who became the monarch of the land and was well-loved by his people.
 
 History 
       The Throne of the United Lands of the Poseidon Ocean     
       The exterior of the kingdom's castle.     
 The kingdom was eventually attacked by  Vector , who led a  large fleet of ships  in an effort to destroy and loot the land, aided by a group of " Gorgonic Guardians ". [1]  They were initially outmatched, but eventually Nasch ordered the land's soldiers into battle equipped with  mirror shields , which were able to defeat the gorgons by reflecting their own weapons back at them. In response, Vector performed a blood sacrifice to call forth the ocean god,  Abyss , which turned the tide of the battle to his favor. Nash's sister  Marin  rode up to where the ocean god stood and was grabbed by its gargantuan hand. Despite the intervention of Nash's friend, a knight named  Dumon , Marin did not want to be saved and instead pitched herself into the depths to call forth  a goddess  in order to purify Abyss.

 Vector's army fled after the god was turned to Nash's side. As they fled, they destroyed several villages. Nash and Dumon ordered their army to give chase. At one of the villages, they found a survivor in a girl who resembled Marin named  Iris . She accompanied them and became fast friends with Nash. Nash led his army against Vector's using Abyss. Eventually, Vector retreated into a temple. Nasch gave chase and Vector challenged him to a  Shadow Duel  to settle things. Nash agreed, but the terms of the Duel dictated that the more  monsters  that are  sent  to the  Graveyard , the more of the Duelist's army will die. Though Nash defeated Vector's "Gorgonic Guardians" using " Number 73: Abyss Splash ", his entire army was decimated due to Vector's  mill  strategy. Dumon survived, but Iris did not. The souls of Nash's army along with Iris would depart into the  Barian World  due to the chaos, causing the small dimension to evolve much larger. [3]
