 Kanji Kana Romaji English 
 ガッツポーズで　勝利を抱きしめる時まで 
加速させて　次へ行こうか、高鳴るビート 
 
Ｌｉｓｔｅｎ、　ｂｏｙｓ　ａｎｄ　ｇｉｒｌｓいたいけな　少年少女の秘密 
ほんとは衝動的、かつ　ワイルドなんだ　知らないでしょ？ 
 
手に負えない　それでいいじゃない 
やんちゃして　学ぶリアル 
予測不可能を貫いて　毅然とカードを切るのさ 
いつだってそう　迷う時は一度目を閉じるよ 
ツトップかける　そこが境界線 
 
ガッツポーズで　勝利を抱きしめる時まで 
止まらないよ　後悔なんてしたくないから 
傷ついても　今は躊躇なんてできないんだ 
諦めない　明日は今日より輝くから 
真剣さ　闘いを極めてゆくだけ 
 
常に自由に　おもしろくなるよ　毎日がＦＩＧＨＴ 
 ガツポーズで　しょうりをだきしめるときまで 
かそくさせて　つぎへいこうか、たかなるビート 
 
リッスン、　ボーイズ　アンド　ガールズいたいけな　しょうねんしょうじょのひみつ 
ほんたわしょうどうてき、かつ　ワイルドなんど　しらないでしょ? 
 
てにおえない　それでいいじゃない 
やんちゃして　まなぶリアル 
よそくふかのうをつらめいて　きぜんとカードをきるのさ 
いつだってそう　まようときはいちどめをとじるよ 
ストップかける　そこがきょうかいせん 
 
ガツポーズで　しょうりをだきしめるときまで 
とまらないよ　こうかいなんてしたくないから 
きずついても　いまはちゅうちょなんてできないんだ 
あきらめない　あすはきょうよりかがやくから 
しんけんさ　たたかいをきわめてゆくだけ 
 
つねにじゆうに　おもしろくなるよ　まいにちがファイト

 Keeping this victory close as I pose for the victory 
will I go next, as I speed up, this pounding heart. 
 
Listen, boys and girls. The secret behind all the innocent kids like you 
is really that you're just so spontaneous, wild as can be. I take it you don't know? 
But being completely uncontrolled is not good 
even if you're troublesome, ya gotta learn for real. 
You have to go right through the unpredictable and shuffle your cards with goal in mind. 
Any time when you think you've lost your way, close your eyes for a moment 
and stop yourself, and you'll see the boundary line. 
 
Keeping this victory close as I pose for the victory 
I'm never gonna stop, 'cuz I don't want things like regret. 
Even if I'm hurt, now's not the time to hesitate 
I'm not gonna give up, because tomorrow shines from today. 
Seriousness just makes me fight harder 
 
I'll always be free and fun, 'cuz every day's a fight.
