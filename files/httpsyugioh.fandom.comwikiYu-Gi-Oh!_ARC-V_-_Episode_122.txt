 Featured Duel: Yuya Sakaki & Jack Atlas vs. Battle Beast & Sanders 
 Duel continues from the previous episode . 
 Turn 8: Battle Beast 
The  effect  of " Gladiator Beast Tamer Editor " inflicts  damage  to the  destroyed   monster 's  controller  equal to its  ATK  (Sanders: 2000 → 0). The  Battle Beast   activates  the effect of " Gladiator Beast Fort ",  returning  the " Gladiator Beast Augustus " underneath it to the  Deck  to inflict 1000 damage to  Yuya . Yuya finds and activates the  Action Card , " Acceleration ", reducing the damage to 0. The Battle Beast activates the effect of his other "Fort", returning the " Gladiator Beast Laquari " underneath it to the Deck to inflict 1000 damage to Yuya. As a card effect would inflict damage,  Jack  activates his  face-down  " Red Gazer ",  paying  half his  Life Points  (Jack: 2000 → 1000) to reduce the damage to 0 and  Special Summon  a " Red Token " (???/100) in  Defense Position . As each "Gladiator Beast Fort" has no cards underneath it, the Battle Beast activates their effects, placing a " Gladiator Beast " monster from his Deck underneath each of them. He chooses "Augustus" and "Laquari".
 Turn 9: Jack 
Jack  draws  and  Normal Summons  " Double Resonator ". He activates the effect of "Double Resonator", letting him treat a monster he controls as a  Tuner monster  once per  turn . He chooses the "Red Token". Jack  Double Tunes  the  Level  8 " Scarlight Red Dragon Archfiend " with the Level 1 Tuner monster "Double Resonator" and the Level 1 Tuner monster "Red Token" to  Synchro Summon  " Tyrant Red Dragon Archfiend " (3500/3000) in Attack Position. Jack activates its effect, letting him destroy all other cards on the field once per turn. As " Gladiator Beast's Assault Fort " was destroyed, its effect activates, letting the Battle Beast activate a " Gladiator Beast's Great Fortress " from his hand, Deck or  Graveyard . He activates one from his Deck. 
 Its effect lets the Battle Beast place all "Gladiator Beast" monsters in his Graveyard underneath it and  negate  the effects of all  face-up  monsters on the field. He places "Augustus", Laquari", " Gladiator Beast Andabata " and " Gladiator Beast Gyzarus " and negates the effects of "Tyrant". "Tyrant" attacks  directly , but the Battle Beast activates the effect of "Great Fortress", letting him Special Summon a "Gladiator Beast" monster that is underneath it, but its effects are negated and its ATK becomes 1000 plus the number of monsters underneath "Great Fortress" times 1000, and it will become the new  attack target . He Special Summons "Andabata" (1000 → 4000/2800). When a monster is  destroyed by battle  or card effect when "Great Fortress" is face-up, that monster's owner will take 500 damage for each monster sent to the Graveyard. The attack is redirected to "Andabatae", but Jack activates the effect of the " Red Armor " in his Graveyard,  banishing  it to prevent the destruction of "Tyrant" by  battle  (Jack: 1000 → 500). At the end of the  Battle Phase , the effect of "Great Fortress" places all "Gladiator Beast" monsters Special Summoned by its effect underneath it. 
 Turn 10: Yuya 
As he controls no monsters, Yuya draws and subsequently activates " Performapal Pendulum Art & Clean ", letting him Special Summon as many face-up Level 1 " Performapal "  Pendulum Monsters  from his  Extra Deck  as possible. They may attack directly, but their effects are negated and Yuya may not Special Summon other monsters this turn. He Special Summons " Performapal Shieldrummer " (???/600), " Performapal Pararhino " (500/???), " Performapal Gongato " (100/100) and " Performapal Odd-Eyes Unicorn " (100/600), all in Attack Position. Yuya Normal Summons " Performapal Hid Hippo " (100/???). "Hid Hippo" attacks directly, but the Battle Beast activates the effect of "Great Fortress", Special Summoning "Andabatae" (1000 → 4000/2800) in Attack Position, who becomes the new attack target.
 Yuya activates the  Quick-Play Spell Card , " Performapal Guard Dance ", preventing "Performapal" monsters he controls from being destroyed by battle this turn and preventing the battle damage. "Shieldrummer" attacks directly and the Battle Beast Special Summons "Gyzarus" (2400 → 3000/1500) with "Great Fortress". "Odd-Eyes Unicorn" attacks directly and the Battle Beast Special Summons "Laquari" (1800 → 2000/400) with "Great Fortress". "Gongato" attacks directly and the Battle Beast Special Summons "Augustus" (2600 → 1000/1000) with "Great Fortress". "Pararhino" attacks directly, but the Battle Beast activates the effect of " Gladiator Beast Noxious " in his hand, Special Summoning it (???/1000) in Defense Position as a direct attack was declared and making it the new attack target.
 Yuya activates the effect of the "Guard Dance" in his Graveyard,  banishing  it to switch control of all "Performapal" monsters he controls that battled this turn with his opponent's monsters. Control of all monsters is switched. Yuya activates the effect of the "Pendulum Art and Clean" in his Graveyard, banishing it to  shuffle  a "Performapal" monster on the field into his Deck and destroy all monsters on the field that were Special Summoned this turn. He returns "Hid Hippo" to destroy all monsters. As monsters were destroyed and sent to the Graveyard (with Yuya's Pendulum Monsters going to the  Extra Deck  face-up instead of the GY), the effect of "Great Fortress" inflicts 500 damage to their controllers for each one (BB: 300 → 0).
