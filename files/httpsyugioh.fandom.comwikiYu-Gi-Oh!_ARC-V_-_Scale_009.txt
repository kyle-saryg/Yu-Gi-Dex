 Summary 
   This summary is currently incomplete. 
 When  Yuya  becomes conflicted with  Sora  claims that he being forced to duel against his will for the sake of his  sister , Yuya hears a voice scolding him for being too gullible. His body is then quickly taken over by  Yuri , who states it to be only fair for Sora to face an opponent who also uses  Fusion Summons . Using his whip to seize an  Action Card  while knocking Sora to the ground, Yuri uses Yuya's monsters to  Fusion Summon  " Predator Plant Chimera Rafflesia " and has it eat Sora's " Frightfur Bear ". Sora's pleas for sister's well-being fall deaf on Yuri's ears as Yuya believes his counterpart is going too far. But Yuri explains that he sees through Sora's lies, ripping Sora's photo to pieces. 
 It was then that Sora, his expression now crazed and with murderous intent, admits to have been lying the entire time while taking advantage of the explosives Yuri unknowingly triggered to reach an Action card. Sora then uses the  Pendulum Monster  cards  Reiji  gave him to  Pendulum Summon  " Edge Imp Cotton Eater " and then Fusion summon " Frightfur Daredevil " who destroys Chimerafflesia. It was then that Yuri, finally noticing Yuzu, finds himself in pain as Sora reveals that he had tripled the damage setting on the dueling field. Concerned for Yuri's wellbeing, Yuya convinces his counterpart to tag him back in. Though Yuri admits to convince him otherwise, he relents and gives rein of their body back to Yuya to finish the duel.
 
 Featured Duel: Yuya Sakaki/Yuri vs. Sora Shiunin 
 Duel continues from the previous Scale . 
 Turn 4: Yuri 
 Yuri  obtains an  Action Card . He then  activates  " Pendulum Fusion ", fusing " Enter-Mate Ballad " and " Enter-Mate Barracuda " in his  Pendulum Zones  to  Fusion Summon  " Predator Plant Chimera Rafflesia " (2500/2000). Yuri  attacks  " Frightfur Bear " with "Chimera Rafflesia", with the latter's  effect  activating; the  ATK  of "Bear" returns to its  original value  ("Frightfur Bear": 3200 → 2200 ATK), while "Chimera Rafflesia" gains the amount of ATK it lost ("Chimera Rafflesia": 2500 → 3500 ATK) during the  battle .  Sora  activates his  face-down  " Album of Memories " to  negate  the attack, but Yuri activates the Action Card " Trap Eraser ", negating the activation of "Album of Memories" and returning it to Sora's  Deck . "Bear" is  destroyed  (Sor:a 3200 → 1900 LP).
 Turn 5: Sora 
Sora obtains an Action Card. Yuri activates the Action Card " Break Action ",  destroying  the Action Card Sora has just obtained; however, that card was " Reaction Draw ", which allows Sora to  draw  a card upon its destruction. Sora activates " Fluffal Fusionist " ( PS : 1) and " Fluffal Angel " (PS: 8) in his Pendulum Zones. Sora  Pendulum Summons  " Edge Imp Cotton Eater " (2400/1600). As it was Special Summoned, the effect of "Cotton Eater" activates, inflicting 1000  damage  to Yuri for each " Frightfur "  monster  in Sora's  Graveyard  (Yuri: 2600 → 1600 LP). [Notes 1]  Sora activates the Pendulum Effect of "Angel",  Special Summoning  a " Fluffal " monster from his  Graveyard  once per turn; he Special Summons " Fluffal Bear " from his Graveyard. Then, he activates the Pendulum Effect of "Fusionist", fusing "Cotton Eater" and "Bear" to Fusion Summon " Frightfur Daredevil " (3000/2500). Sora attacks and destroys "Chimera Rafflesia" with "Dare-Devil" (Yuri: 1600 → 1100 LP). As it destroyed a monster by battle, the effect of "Dare-Devil" inflicts 1000 damage to Yuri (Yuri: 1100 → 100 LP).
 At this point,  Yuya  convinces Yuri to allow him to switch back.

 Notes 
 
 ↑   Sora explains that "Cotton Eater" inflicts 100 damage per monster. However, since he only has a single monster and inflicted 1000 damage, the effect seems to inflict 1000 damage per monster, indicating that the "100" may have been a typo.
