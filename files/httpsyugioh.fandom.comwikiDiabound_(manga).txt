 Biography 
 Ancient Egypt 
 Diabound is first Summoned when  Bakura  entered the  pharaoh's palace  in his first attempt to take the  Millennium Items . Everyone present is shocked by the strength of Bakura's hatred and that Diabound is actually a holy spirit, which Bakura claims is due to his loyalty to his cause.  Seto  ignores the spirit's strength and attempts to seal Diabound in a stone tablet with his  Millennium Rod , but Diabound breaks free with ease. Unfazed, Seto instead Summons " Galestgoras " to Duel Diabound. Galestgoras battles well, but Bakura uses the special power of Diabound to shatter the tablet that Summoned Galestgoras. He then has Diabound engage in battle with the other  ka  Summoned by the Priests and easily overpowers them. Atem, after reclaiming his father,  Akhenamkhanen 's mummy from Bakura, Summons one of the three  gods  from the  Shrine of Wedju , " The God of the Obelisk " and soon Bakura finds himself on the receiving end of an easy overpowering. Despite his loss, Diabound is able to survive and Bakura escapes.
 Bakura later Summons Diabound when  Mahado , bearer of the  Millennium Ring , leads him into Akhenamkhanen's tomb to Duel. Despite Diabound having evolved into a new form due to Bakura's hatred becoming stronger, inside the tomb, Mahado's " Illusion Magician " is able to fight at its full power and the two battle evenly. Bakura eventually triggers one of the tomb's traps and kills Mahado, but the Priest fuses his  ba  with the  Magus of Illusion  into the Dark Magician and attempts to destroy Diabound for good. 
 Bakura survives again, and infiltrating the  Shrine of Wedju  to attack  Akhenaden , he has Diabound, whose form has evolved yet again with the acquisition of the Millennium Ring, use its phasing power to destroy the stone tablets before Akhenaden can Summon them. When he flees from the Shrine, he Summons Diabound as the Pharaoh pursues him with " Slifer the Sky Dragon ", another of the gods from the Shrine of Wedju. Despite its power-up, Slifer retains the advantage, until Bakura begins attacking the townspeople, forcing Slifer to defend them, not only taking the attacks but also restricting its movement. Diabound hides with its power and nearly kills Atem, but the priests intervene and rescue him. Diabound defeats Slifer when Atem sacrifices it for a chance to win, but is saved when Bakura has  Illushu  intercept the attack of  Duos . Bakura takes the  Millennium Pendant  from Atem and leaves him for dead after throwing him from a cliff. 
 Atem survives, coming to  Kul Elna  to reclaim the Puzzle and defeat Bakura. Bakura Summons the again-evolved Diabound, and the Pharaoh is defended by Mahado in the form of Dark Magician. With Diabound handicapped protecting the  Millennium Stone , the battle proves to be largely even, but Diabound resists repeated attempts to slay it and phases into the walls.  Shada 's attempts to find it prove unsuccessful until Atem has Mahado open up holes in the ceiling to let light into the chamber and reveal Diabound. Diabound is able to survive when Bakura has the spirits of Kul Elna form a protective shield around it. The Priests arrive to save Atem after Shada is injured and Bakura takes the  Millennium Key , causing Diabound to grow in strength. They Summon their  ka , but Diabound once again overpowers them until  Kalim  has the idea to use the  Millennium Scale  to combine the  ba  of two  ka , Duos and  Curse of Dragon , into  Duos Dragon . The fused ka proves to be an equal to Diabound when enhanced by Mahado's magic, but is unable to break through the shield. Bakura seizes his chance to kill Kalim and take the Millennium Scale,  seperating  Duos Dragon, but the attack did indeed break the spirit shield and Mahdo finishes Diabound off with his Dark Magic attack. With Diabound's destruction, Bakura slowly dies as well.
 
 World of Memories 
 When  Dark Yugi  enters the world of his memories to relive the events of his death, he replays his battles with Bakura and Diabound. In a departure from the original events of history,  Yugi Mutou  reunites with Dark Yugi and replenishes his energy after the destruction of Slifer, allowing the Pharaoh to Summon " The Sun Dragon Ra " and destroy Diabound with its God Phoenix form. The spirit of Akhenaden, claiming to be  Zorc Necrophades , then appears to rewind time as the first use of  Dark Bakura 's ability to control time in the  Shadow RPG , and Diabound's destruction is undone, with events playing out from that point as they had in history.

 Due to  Bakura 's loyalty to his village and his cause, Diabound is actually a holy or god type spirit. However, due to the fact that Bakura's hatred is what increases its strength, it later develops into a more demonic form.
