 Nowhere, as far I know. You were right to remove it. --  Deltaneos  ( talk ) 13:22, 14 August 2008 (UTC) 
 Air Date 
 when do think the English Dub of this season will air? my guess it would be after 5D's, and sometime during the summer but I'm not sure.

 It properly won't 
 From what i heard this season of GX will never be dubbed or aired because 4Kids said that making season 4 of GX would be unprofitable, so the closest that we'll get to a dub is episode with subtitles on the internet. Either that or learn Japanese XD. -- Trivi-AM  18:34, 10 February 2009 (UTC)
 
 Where did you hear this? --  Deltaneos  ( talk ) 19:11, 10 February 2009 (UTC) 
 well that's a shame, but Why would it be unprofitable? I tought it wasn't going to air becuase of the  Yu-Gi-Oh! 5D's  show that's currently airing, or maybe because of the personality change  Jaden  goes through.

 I have no idea why they said that either. To answer Delta's question it was unofficially stated on the 4Kids website when Yu-Gi-Oh! Gx Season 3 started to air in Japan, they stated that season 3 of GX would the last season dubbed by them and later said that they wouldn't give the rights to dub it to any other company. -- Trivi-AM  20:30, 11 February 2009 (UTC)
 
 you said this was unofficial right? That means they might dub this season (Just a theory), but I wouldn't give my hopes up that easily. they may do it or they may not. But either way who knows?  Little Shroomish  16:25, 24 February 2009 (UTC) 
 Evidence that they might 
 I have found a pic that has the English Dub  Yubel  and  Banner . it's on my page.

 I just remembered that I sent a letter to 4kids web master back in August last year (I just found the letter again this morning XP). The reply I got said that 4kids was concentrating their funds on dubbing 5D's, for when it was released, and said they would Dub GX when they finsihed with 5D's. So they could possibly Dub Season 4 after they've finished with 5D's, I just hope they don't do what they've done with some of their other anime's and change all the voice actors; because they it wouldn't sound right at allÂ :(. -- Trivi-AM  16:41, 12 March 2009 (UTC) 
 who gives a sh*t? the dub was goddamn awful anyways your better of watching the sub
