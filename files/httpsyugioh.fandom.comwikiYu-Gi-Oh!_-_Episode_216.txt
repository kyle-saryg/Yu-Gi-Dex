 Summary 
 (NOTE: for steps in the  Yugi Muto  vs.  Yami Bakura  Duel please see the  Featured Duel  section below) 
 
 The Retrieval of the Millennium Items 
 Shada  has just sacrificed his life to protect the  Pharaoh  from  Zorc 's attack. Meanwhile Zorc continues relentlessly to destroy the Pharaoh's troops. 
 Shimon Muran  says the only way they can stand a chance is if the three  Egyptian Gods  are Summoned, but the Pharaoh lost his  Millennium Puzzle  and his life energy is too low.
 Isis  suggests they must go out in the desert and search for the  Millennium Items , so that all the remaining  Guardians  can restore their energy.
 While the Pharaoh's troops create a diversion,  Isis  Summons " Winged Dragon, Guardian of the Fortress " and climbs on its back, departing with  Mana  and " Spiria " to look for the items. 
 Back at  Kul Elna ,  Isis  &  Mana  immediately find all the  Millennium Items : the Scale, Rod, Ring, Puzzle, Eye, Key, and Necklace were all within a short distance from one another.
 For retrieving her  Millennium Necklace   Isis 's life force is replenished to maximum. 
 Upon Isis & Mana's return to the Capital however,  Zorc  senses the presence of the Items and immediately attacks Isis's " Winged Dragon, Guardian of the Fortress ".  Isis  tells  Mana  to dismount and bring the items back to the  Pharaoh . Meanwhile, she uses her  Millennium Necklace  to increase her Dragon's strength and create a diversion by attacking Zorc.
 Zorc destroys " Winged Dragon, Guardian of the Fortress " and  Isis 's life force is no more. 
 Exodia the Forbidden One 
 Mana  is intercepted by  Shimon Muran , who takes the  Millennium Key  from her in order to buy them more time. Mana brings the remaining items to the Pharaoh.
 Shimon uses the Millennium Key to Summon " Exodia the Forbidden One ". 
 Priest Seto  " It's the Forbiddden One! A beast so powerful it was able to defeat an army of thousands in a single night!" 
 Pharaoh  " Exodia! " 
 Shimon Muran  (to Exodia) " Had it not been for you old friend, this land would surely have fallen at the hands of his enemies. Due to your incredible strength I sealed you within five Stone Tablets, vowing never to release you again. Now I lift that seal! " 
 For a short while Exodia holds its own against Zorc (NOTE: present in the original Japanese and cut from the English dub, a scene where Exodia rips out Zorc's arm, who then grows it back because he is immortal, and Zorc doing the same thing to Exodia, Exodia also growing the arm back). 
 Eventually Shimon orders Exodia to  Obliterate , but Zorc immediately counter-attacks and destroys Exodia (splitting him in half).  Shimon  loses the last of his life energy and is no more. 
 Zorc Necrophades  " Pharaoh, opposing me is futile. I am the embodiment of pure darkness, and as the world is enveloped by the shadows my power shall grow! Now kneel before your new master! " 
 Pharaoh  " No! The light of hope still shines upon the people of Egypt, and that light can illuminate even the darkest of shadows! " 
 At this point,  Mana  brings back the Items and the Pharaoh's  Millennium Puzzle . His life energy is replenished. 
 
 
 Featured Duel: Yugi Muto vs. Yami Bakura 
 Duel continues from previous episode. 
 Yugi has 2400 Life Points remaining and controls "Silent Swordsman LV4" (3000/1000) and "Marshmallon" (300/500) in Attack Position and " Marshmallon Glasses ".
 Yami Bakura has 1600 Life Points remaining and controls no cards.
 Turn 6: Bakura 
Yami Bakura draws. He then activates " Spirit Sword of Sealing " to remove Yugi's " Silent Swordsman LV4 " from play. Yami Bakura then Normal Summons " Disgraced Mage " (1700/1400) in Attack Position. "Disgraced Mage" attacks Yugi's " Marshmallon ". Due to the second effect of "Marshmallon", it is not destroyed ( Yugi  2400 → 1000).
 Turn 7: Yugi 
Yugi draws " Blocken " and subsequently Normal Summons it (100/300) in  Defense Position  (Yugi's Deck: 32 → 31).
 Turn 8: Bakura 
Yami Bakura draws. "Disgraced Mage" attacks Yugi's "Marshmallon", but Yugi activates the effect of "Blocken" to force Bakura's "Disgraced Mage" to attack it instead. "Disgraced Mage" destroys "Blocken". Since "Disgraced Mage" destroyed a monster by battle, its first effect activates, returning "Blocken" to Yugi's  Deck  instead of sending it to the  Graveyard . Since "Blocken" was destroyed in battle, its effect activates, letting Yugi Special Summon " Lengard " (300/100) in  Attack Position . Yami Bakura sets three cards.
 Turn 9: Yugi 
Yugi draws (Yugi's Deck: 31 → 30). "Marshmallon" attacks Bakura's "Disgraced Mage". Due to the second effect of "Marshmallon", it is not destroyed. Yugi then activates the effect of "Lengard" to destroy it and negate all  Battle Damage  he would have taken. Since a monster was destroyed and sent to Yugi's  Graveyard , "Silent Swordsman LV4" is returned to the field (3000/1000) in Attack Position and "Spirit Sword of Sealing" is destroyed. 
 "Silent Swordsman LV4" attacks and destroys "Disgraced Mage", but Yami Bakura activates the second effect of "Disgraced Mage" to return it and his entire  hand  to his  Deck  in order to negate all  Battle Damage  he would have taken.
 Turn 10: Bakura 
Yami Bakura draws " Pot of Greed " and subsequently activates it to draw two cards. Yami Bakura then activates " Cursed Twin Dolls " to force Yugi to pick between the Red or the Black Gift-Box. After Yugi chooses his box, Bakura will get the other Box. Yugi picks the Red Gift-Box, so Yugi's Life Points will increase by 200 for each card sent from his hand or  Deck  to the  Graveyard . 
 Yami Bakura gains the Black Gift-Box and this causes his  Graveyard  to be removed. It also causes all of Bakura's cards to become Phantoms, which are treated as being on his side of the field. Phantoms do not count towards the  Monster  or  Spell & Trap Card Zone  limit, cannot attack or be attacked, have their effects negated, and are unaffected by all effects. Yami Bakura then Normal Summons " Necro Soldier " (0/0) in  Defense Position .
 Duel continues next episode. 
 
 Mistakes 
 When Yami Bakura activates " Cursed Twin Dolls " in order to destroy his Graveyard, one of the showed spirit that was lying in his Graveyard is shown to be " Disgraced Mage ", even though it has been returned to the Deck via its own effect.
