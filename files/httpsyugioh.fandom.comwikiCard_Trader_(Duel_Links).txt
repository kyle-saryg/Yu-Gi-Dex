 Trading 
 The Card Trader possesses an inventory of cards that is divided in two sets: Featured Cards and Regular Inventory.
 Featured Cards contain recent cards, from which a certain set is chosen randomly for each player and becomes their current stock. The player can purchase any of its cards, but only 1 copy of each. The stock can only be reset after every 8 hours, and is automatically done so when the player visits the Card Trader again.
 The Regular Inventory is always available, and any of its cards can be purchased. However, after buying a card the player must wait for a certain amount of time until another card from the Regular Inventory can be purchased.
 Each card can be obtained by using Gold, Jewels, and Stones. The latter two are equal to the card's  Rarity  and  Attribute . For example, a SR  WATER  monster requires SR Jewels and Stones of Water to be purchased.
 
 Foil upgrade 
 The cards sold by the Card Trader can also be upgraded to a higher foil, which consists Glossy and Prismatic. Unlike trading for cards with Basic foil, the amount of Gold, Jewels and Stones required to upgrade a card's foiling is fixed to its Rarity, not varying for each individual card, but the type of Stone required is still based on the card's Attribute.
 Any card in the Card Trader's inventory can be upgraded to Glossy foiling, and only UR and SR cards can be upgraded to Prismatic foiling.
