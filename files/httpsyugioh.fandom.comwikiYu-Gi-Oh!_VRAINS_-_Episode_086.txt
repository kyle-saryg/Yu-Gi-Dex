 Featured Duel: Lightning vs. Specter 
         
 The Duel is conducted as a  Master Duel .
 Turn 1: Lightning 
Lightning  Normal Summons  " Armatos Legio Gradius " (0/800). As "Gradius" was Normal Summoned, its effect lets Lightning add " Armatos Colosseum " from his Deck to his hand. Lightning activates the Field Spell "Armatos Colosseum", letting him add an " Armatos Legio " monster from his Deck to his hand. He adds " Armatos Legio Speculata ". Lightning uses "Gradius" to  Link Summon  " Armatos Legio Decurion " (1000/LINK-1/↓) to the  Extra Monster Zone . Lightning activates the other effect of "Armatos Colosseum", sending a Level 4 or lower "Armatos Legio" monster from his hand to the  GY , then targeting an "Armatos Legio"  Link Monster  he controls to Special Summon as many "Armatos Legio" monsters as possible with different names from each other and the monster sent to the GY to activate this effect in  Defense Position  to his zones that Link Monster points to. He sends " Armatos Legio Sica " to the GY, targets "Decurion"  and Special Summons "Gradius" to the zone the bottom-center Link Arrow of "Decurion" points to. Lightning sends " Armatos Legio Scutum " from his hand to his GY to Special Summon " Armatos Legio Speculata " (0/1800) in Defense Position from his hand via its own effect. Lightning uses "Gradius" and "Speculata" to Link Summon " Armatos Legio Centurion " (1700/LINK-2/←→) to the zone the bottom-center Link Arrow of "Decurion" points to. Lightning activates the effect of "Colosseum" again, sending an unknown "Armatos Legio" monster from his hand to the GY to Special Summon "Gradius" and "Sica" to the zones the middle-left and middle-right Link Arrows of "Centurion" points to respectively. Lightning uses "Gradius" to Link Summon another " Armatos Legio Decurion" to the zone the middle-left Link Arrow of "Centurion" points to.
 Lightning activates the  Link Spell  " Judgment Arrows " (↖↑↗) at the Spell & Trap Zone the bottom-center Link Arrow of "Decurion" points to. Lightning uses "Sica" and "Centurion" to Link Summon " Armatos Legio Primi Ordines " (1800/LINK-2/↙↑) to the zone the top-right Link Arrow of "Judgment Arrows" points to. He activates the effect of "Primi Ordines", letting him Special Summon a Level 4 or lower "Armatos Legio" monster from his GY. He Special Summons "Gradius". He uses "Gradius" and "Decurion" to Link Summon " Armatos Legio Pilus Prior " (2000/LINK-2/↑↘) to the zone the top-left Link Arrow of "Judgment Arrows" points to. As "Pilus Prior" was Link Summoned, Lightning activates its effect, banishing cards from the top of his Deck equal to the number of co-linked monsters he controls, then adding those cards to his hand during his next Standby Phase. He banishes " Armatos Legio Galea ", " Armatos Legio Magica Alcum ", and " Armatos Lex ". He activates the effect of "Pilus Prior", letting him Special Summon a Level 4 or lower "Armatos Legio" monster from his GY. He Special Summons "Gradius". Lightning uses "Gradius" to Link Summon "Armatos Legio Decurion" to the second Extra Monster Zone, creating an  Extra Link .
 Turn 2: Specter 
Specter Normal Summons " Sunseed Genius Loci " (0/600). As he controls a  Plant   Normal Monster , he Special Summons " Sunseed Shadow " (0/400) from his hand via its own effect. Specter pays 800 LP (Specter: 4000 → 3200 LP) to activate the  Continuous Spell Card  " Sunvine Plunder ", targeting a face-up Spell Card Lightning controls and taking  control  of it. He targets and takes control of "Judgment Arrows", placing it in his center Spell & Trap Zone. He uses "Genius Loci" and "Shadow" to Link Summon " Sunavalon Daphne " (0/LINK-2/←→) to the zone the top-center Link Arrow of "Judgment Arrows" points to. Specter discards a card from his hand to activate the Continuous Spell Card " Sunvine Shrine ", which lets him Special Summon a Level 4 or lower Plant Normal Monster from the GY once per turn. He activates this effect to Special Summon "Genius Loci" from the GY. He uses "Genius Loci" to Link Summon " Sunvine Thrasher " (800/LINK-1/↓) to the zone the middle-right Link Arrow of "Daphne" points to. Specter activates the effect of "Thrasher", which lets him increase its ATK by 800 for every Link Arrow a "Sunavalon" Link Monster that points to it has, in this case two ("Thrasher": 800 → 2400 ATK). 
 "Thrasher"  attacks  a "Decurion". As a Link Monster "Judgment Arrows" points to is battling, its effect makes that monster's ATK become double its current ATK during damage calculation only ("Thrasher": 2400 → 4800 ATK). "Thrasher" destroys "Decurion", but the effect of "Primi Ordines" reduces the  Battle Damage  by 1000 for every  co-linked  monster Lightning controls, in this case 4000, so Lightning takes no damage. As "Thrasher" destroyed a monster by battle, Specter activates its effect, Special Summoning that monster to a zone a "Sunavalon" Link Monster points to. Spectre Special Summons "Decurion" to the zone the middle-left Link Arrow of "Daphne" points to. Specter's "Decurion" attacks Lightning's "Decurion".  As a Link Monster "Judgment Arrows" points to is battling, its effect makes that monster's ATK become double its current ATK during damage calculation only (Specter's "Decurion": 1000 → 2000 ATK). Lightning's "Decurion" is destroyed, but Lightning takes no Battle Damage due to the effect of "Primi Ordines". Specter activates the Continouous Spell Card " Sunvine Cross Breed ", letting him  Tribute  a Link Monster he controls to Special Summon a Plant monster from his GY with its effect negated. He Tributes "Decurion" to Special Summon "Genius Loci" from his GY. Specter uses "Genius Loci" to Link Summon " Sunavalon Dryas " (0/LINK-1/↓) to the Extra Monster Zone.
