 Appearance 
       Sarina's designs incorporate multiple layers of clothing and a wide range of expressions. Depicted here is Sarina in full regalia from front and rear alongside views of her head from different angles and details of her lips, eyes and height in comparison to  Jaden .     
 Sarina's character designs were overseen by  Kenichi Hara . Sarina wears the ceremonial red and white clothes of a miko with sandals. Her dark hair is elaborately arranged in a flowing ponytail behind her, with the bangs closest to her face positioned on the outermost edges of her head; she also wears round earrings. She carries an Academy-issued  Duel Disk  on her left hand.
 
 Abilities 
 Sarina wields supernatural powers like predicting the future, just like  her brother . She can materialize Duel Monsters, bestow special abilities onto others, teleport herself and others, trap people in her mirrors, create a spiritual barrier around a whole city, and even duplicate herself.
 
 Biography 
 Sarina is the sister of  Sartorius . She first sent the first two members of her brigade ( Frost  and  Thunder ) after  Syrus  and  Hassleberry ; in the end, Frost defeated both his partner and his opponents (using a  card  Sarina gave both he and Thunder that Thunder couldn't use). When Frost returned, he was intending to duel Jaden himself; but Sarina, unimpressed with Frost's close-call victory, sealed him and Thunder in a mirror. She then sent  T-Bone  and  Blaze  to find and defeat Jaden; but she sealed Blaze away when they found him, and despite infusing Frost's, Thunder's and Blaze's powers into T-Bone's Deck, T-Bone lost and was sealed away.
 After disposing of her subordinates, she challenged  Aster  and  Jaden  to a  Tag Duel  in  KaibaLand 's virtual system but was ultimately defeated. Sarina then revealed that she wished to save her brother from the influence of an evil aura housed in a  Destiny Hero   card  that was shown to him when they were younger. 
 In a final act of gratitude she helped those trapped within the virtual world to escape but was left behind in the collapsing program, digitizing herself to act as her brother's "guardian". While no mention of it is made in the English adaptation, the Japanese version further includes a promise by  Solomon Muto  to speak with  Seto Kaiba  in the hopes of restoring her consciousness. 
 Sarina later returns near the end of the second year to contribute to the  satellite 's demise. Afterward she is flown in to  Duel Academy  via helicopter by Kaiba's associates and gets reunited with her brother after he gets free from  The Light of Destruction .
 She is captured by  Nightshroud  under unknown circumstances in order to force  Sartorius  to accept the power of darkness. He corners and duels  Jaden  in order to save his sister but she appears to Jaden and urges him to defeat her brother. 
 Jaden does so, overcoming Sartorius' card " Arcana Force 0 - The Fool " that he placed in Jaden's  Deck  and he is reunited with his sister in the  World of Darkness . They are both revived when Jaden defeats Nightshroud. After that, she was present at Jaden's graduation ceremony.
 
 Non-canon appearances 
 In  Yu-Gi-Oh! GX Tag Force 2 , Sarina appears in several  Society of Light -themed storylines. She is erroneously referred to as "Sartorius" due to a translation error.
 
 Deck 
 Sarina plays a  Mirror Deck . Each of her Silver Spirit 「式神,  Shikigami 」  monsters , based off spirits called  shikigami , is paired with another and she uses their  effects  to constantly revive them from the  Graveyard  to either  activate  " Mirror Bind ", or to activate " Full Moon Mirror ".
 Once 10 counters have been placed on " Full Moon Mirror ", she is able to activate " Infinite Fiend Mirror " to  summon  9 " Dark Creator Tokens " of her powerful " Dark Creator " to the  field .
 The concept of Sarina's cards is derived from  onmyōdō  and she herself takes on the role of an onmyōji during episodes in which she makes appearances.
