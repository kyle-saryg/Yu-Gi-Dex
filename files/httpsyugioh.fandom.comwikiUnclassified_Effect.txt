Unclassified Effects  are  card effects  that do not fit into any effect category. Unlike  conditions , they are card effects, so they can potentially be  negated . They are similar to  Continuous Effects  as they do not  activate  (use a  Chain ), so cards that respond to activations like " Divine Wrath " and " Debunk " cannot respond to them.
 In OCG rulings they are described by the following. " This effect does not have a classification. It is neither a  Continuous Effect  nor an  Ignition Effect  nor a  Trigger Effect  nor a  Quick Effect . "
 Sometimes, these are colloquially referred to as  " Conditions  that can be negated" . However, unlike Continuous Effects, they can be applied while the card is not  face-up  on the  field , such as in the  hand  and  Graveyard , or in the case of the "Multiple Tributers", while  face-down  on the field as well.

 Examples 
 " Summon effects "  such as " Cyber Dragon ", " Machina Fortress ", " Grapha, Dragon Lord of Dark World " and " Familiar-Possessed - Aussa ". As such, if " Dark Ruler Ha Des " destroys " Grapha, Dragon Lord of Dark World " by battle, "Grapha"'s Special Summoning effect cannot be used to Special Summon itself from the Graveyard. 
 " Only-1-on-field "  such as " Solar Wind Jammer " and " Malefic " monsters. Note if " Skill Drain " is negating the effect of a face-up " Malefic Truth Dragon " on the field, you still cannot Summon another "Malefic" monster, since its effect is still active while it is in the hand. 
 " Control only one "  such as " Bujin Yamato " and " Gagaga Magician ". Similar to the above restriction, you cannot Summon another copy if "Skill Drain" is negating the one on the field. 
 "Substitute Effects"  such as " Destiny HERO - Departed " ( ... banish it instead ) and " Archlord Kristya " ( ... it returns to the top of the Deck, instead. ). 
 " Treated as Continuous Spell Card "  such as " Pumprincess the Princess of Ghosts " and " Crystal Beast " monsters.

 " Fusion Substitute Monsters "  such as " Beastking of the Swamps " and " Mystical Sheep #1 ". 
 "Graveyard effects"  such as " Phantom Beast Cross-Wing ", " Harpie Queen ", " Elemental HERO Necroshade " and  Gemini monsters . 
 "Hand effects"  such as " Simorgh, Bird of Ancestry ". 
 "Extra Deck Summon Level treat effects"  such as " Road Synchron " and " Star Drawing "
