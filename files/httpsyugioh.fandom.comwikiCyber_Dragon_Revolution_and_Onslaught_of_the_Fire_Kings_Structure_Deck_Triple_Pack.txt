 Cyber Dragon Revolution and Onslaught of the Fire Kings Structure Deck: Triple Pack 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Cyber Dragon Revolution and Onslaught of the Fire Kings Structure Deck: Triple Pack  is an original product in the video game  Yu-Gi-Oh! Duel Arena . It was only available after maintenance on September 17, 2014 until after maintenance on October 8, 2014.
 Each product costs 87,000 Miniclip Credits.
 This product's purpose was to prevent players from receiving 4 or more copies of the same card, like they would have if they bought 3 copies of both original Structure Decks in-game. To make up the difference and ensure players would receive the same amount of cards as they would have with 3 copies of both Structure Decks, bonus cards were included that complemented the Decks' strategies, along with 6 extra bonus cards. As such, there are no more than 3 copies of any individual card in this product, the exceptions being " Cyber Dragon " and " Cyber End Dragon ", treating their alternate artwork versions as separate cards.
