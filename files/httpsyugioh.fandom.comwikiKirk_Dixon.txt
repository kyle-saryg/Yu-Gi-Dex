 Biography 
 Dixon was one of the thirteen  Card Professor  mercenaries hired by  Yako Tenma  for  Project R.A. .
 Katsuya Jonouchi  accidentally triggered a trap, which separated himself and  Hiroto Honda  from  Dark Yugi , shortly before Dixon appeared. Dixon explained that for reasons beyond the understanding of the Card Professors, Yugi was stronger when his friends were around him, so the trap had been necessary to exclude such factors. He mocked Jonouchi and Honda for falling for the first trap and when Dark Yugi asked him where Jonouchi and Honda were, he said he didn't know but guessed they were where he thought they belonged, in the garbage room. Enraged, Dark Yugi accepted  the Duel  to make Dixon pay for his remarks. [1] 
 Dixon quickly brought out " Machine Soldier ", " Machine Defender " and " Machine Blaster " and used " Commander Covington " to merge them into " Machine Force ". However, Dark Yugi used " Spellbinding Illusion " to  negate  the effect of "Commander Covington", splitting "Machine Force" back into its three components and used " Dark Magician Girl " and " Diffusion Wave-Motion " to attack all of Dixon's monsters and drop his  Life Points  to 0. [1] 
 Shocked by his defeat, Dixon dropped a number of cards, including a card key, Dark Yugi needed to access the next part of the building. He then stumbled onto a trap which catapulted him into a trash receptacle. Jonouchi and Honda then spotted him on a lower floor as he fell through a chute and into a skip. [1] 
 
 Deck 
 Kirk uses a " Machina "  Deck . In the English manga, the word "Machina" is replaced with "Machine".
