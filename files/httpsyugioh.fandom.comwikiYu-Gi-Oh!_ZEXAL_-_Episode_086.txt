 Featured Duel: Yuma Tsukumo vs. Alito 
 Duel continues from  the previous episode . 
 Turn 5: Alito 
 Alito  draws. He then  Normal Summons  " Battlin' Boxer Switchitter " ( 4/1500/1400) in Attack Position. This card can be treated as two monsters for an Xyz Summon. He then  activates  " Battlin' Boxer Spirits " to  send  the top card of his  Deck  to the  Graveyard . If it is a " Battlin' Boxer "  monster , he can  Special Summon  another  Level  4 or lower "Battlin' Boxer" monster from his Graveyard. The sent card is " Battlin' Boxer Counterpunch ", so Alito Special Summons " Battlin' Boxer Headgeared " ( 4/1000/1800) in Attack Position. Alito  overlays  "Battlin' Boxer Headgeared" and "Battlin' Boxer Switchitter" in order to  Xyz Summon  " Number 105: Battlin' Boxer Star Cestus " ( 4/2500/1600, ORU: 2) in  Attack Position . 
 "Battlin' Boxer Star Cestus"  attacks  " Number 39: Utopia ", but  Yuma  activates the effect of "Utopia",  detaching  an Overlay Unit ("Utopia": 2 → 1 ORU) to  negate  the attack. Alito activates the effect of "Battlin' Boxer Star Cestus" (as it is  battling  a monster that has  ATK  higher than it), detaching an Overlay Unit ("Battlin' Boxer Star Cestus": 2 → 1 ORU) to prevent the attack from being negated, prevent "Battlin' Boxer Star Cestus" from being destroyed  by this battle  and inflict the  Battle Damage  Alito would take to Yuma instead (Yuma: 3000 → 500 LP). Alito  Sets  a card.
 Turn 6: Yuma 
 Astral  and Yuma perform  ZEXAL Morph . Yuma draws " Xyz Treasure " and subsequently activates it to draw two cards (one for each Xyz Monster on the  field ). Yuma overlays "Utopia" with itself via  Chaos Xyz Evolution  in order to Xyz Summon " Chaos Number 39: Utopia Ray " ( 4/2500/2000, ORU: 1) in Attack Position. "Utopia Ray" attacks "Battlin' Boxer Star Cestus", destroying both monsters in a Double KO. Yuma then activates " Xyz Stand " to revive "Utopia Ray" ( 4/2500/2000) in Attack Position with its effects negated and forbidding it from attacking this turn (as an Xyz Monster was destroyed by battle and  sent  to the Graveyard this turn). Alito activates his own face-down "Xyz Stand" to revive "Battlin' Boxer Star Cestus" ( 4/2500/1600) in Attack Position with the same restrictions.
 Turn 7: Alito 
Alito draws "Xyz Treasure" and subsequently activates it to draw two cards. He then activates " Rank-Up-Magic Barian's Force " to  Rank-Up  "Battlin' Boxer Star Cestus" via Chaos Xyz Evolution in order to Xyz Summon " Chaos Number 105: Battlin' Boxer Comet Cestus " ( 5/2800/2000, ORU: 1) in Attack Position. Alito activates the effect of "Battlin' Boxer Comet Cestus" to destroy "Utopia Ray" and inflict damage to Yuma equal to the destroyed monster's ATK by detaching "Battlin' Boxer Star Cestus" ("Battlin' Boxer Comet Cestus": 1 → 0 ORU). Yuma activates his face-down " Overtraining " to prevent "Utopia Ray" from being destroyed by battle or by card effects this turn. However, it will be destroyed and sent to the Graveyard at his next  End Phase . "Battlin' Boxer Comet Cestus" attacks "Utopia Ray", but the latter isn't destroyed (Yuma: 500 → 200 LP). Alito Sets a card.
 Turn 8: Yuma 
Yuma performs a  Shining Draw  and draws " ZW - Eagle Claw ", Yuma then Normal Summons "ZW - Eagle Claw" ( 5/2000/1200) without  Tribute  via its own effect as Alito has 2000 or more  Life Points  than Yuma. He then activates the second effect of "Eagle Claw" to  equip  it to "Utopia Ray" and increase its ATK by 2000 ("Utopia Ray": 2500 → 4500 ATK). "Utopia Ray" attacks "Battlin' Boxer Comet Cestus", but Alito activates the effect of ""Battlin' Boxer Counterpunch" to  banish  it from his Graveyard in order to activate " Battle Rush " from Yuma's Graveyard as his card, which will prevent "Battlin' Boxer Comet Cestus" from being destroyed by battle and inflict the Battle Damage Alito would take to Yuma instead. Yuma activates the last effect of "Eagle Claw" to negate the effect of "Battle Rush" as the equipped monster is battling. As Yuma activated an effect during the  Battle Phase , Alito activates his face-down " Corkscrew Counter " to negate the effect of "Eagle Claw" and destroy it as well as inflict 500 damage to Yuma. Yuma activates his face-down " Last Chance " (as his opponent activated a  Counter Trap Card ) to activate " Counter Clash " from Alito's Graveyard as his card, which negates and destroys "Corkscrew Counter" and doubles the battle damage taken from this battle. "Utopia Ray" then destroys "Battlin' Boxer Comet Cestus" (Alito: 2800 → 0 LP).

 The scene where  Ray  shouts  ZEXAL  is cut from the dub. 
 Mistakes 
         The  field  error.     
 In the Japanese version, during the  field  overview when  Yuma  ends  turn  6, " Number C105: Battlin' Boxer Comet Cestus " is shown on  Alito 's field rather than " Number 105: Battlin' Boxer Star Cestus ". tThis was corrected in the dub.
