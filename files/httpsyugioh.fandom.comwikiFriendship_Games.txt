 Purpose 
 Its purpose was to help decide the representative for the  Super Secret Number Card Investigation Club , but its real purpose was to take  Yuma 's and  Shark 's " Number " cards. Girag told Yuma that if he made it to the final round, he must lose on purpose. That plan failed, since Shark left the tournament early, forcing Girag to fight in Shark's place. This made him worried due to the fact that Barians will disappear if they lose to someone with a " CXyz " monster. At first things didn't go well with Girag due to Yuma trying to fulfill his promise to Girag of letting their opponents,  Tori Meadows  and  Cathy Katherine , win. When Tori Summoned " CXyz Dark Fairy Cheer Girl ", Girag was even more worried about his disappearance. However, Yuma realized that Tori and Cathy were being brainwashed by the Barians and won the Duel with " Number 39: Utopia " with the help from Girag. The entire plan failed and Girag fled, with Yuma being chased down by Tori and Cathy.  [1]
