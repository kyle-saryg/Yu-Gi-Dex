"Revive"  is an informal term to describe  Special Summoning  a  monster  from the  Graveyard . The ability to return a monster from the Graveyard to the  field  is a relatively common yet nonetheless important  card effect  since it helps a player maintain  field advantage  and can, in some cases, allow them to bring back a monster that was difficult to  Summon  in the first place. Most of the more general-use cards that deal with this, such as " Premature Burial ", are  Limited  or  Forbidden , though there are much fewer legal restrictions on cards that deal with only specific kinds of monsters, such as " Infernity Launcher ".
 Sometimes it is easier to dump a Monster Card into the Graveyard before it has been Summoned and then revive it onto the  field  using one of the many revival cards available; to restrict this, many very powerful monster cards do not allow this, in particular  nomi ,  Special Summon-only ,  Fusion ,  Ritual ,  Synchro , and  Xyz Monsters .
