 Biography 
 Tilla was one of thirteen  Card professor  mercenaries hired by  Yako Tenma  for  Project R.A.  She was to be Yugi's second opponent at  KaibaCorp  and was offered a cash reward if she could defeat him. [1] 
 She appeared before  Dark Yugi ,  Jonouchi , and  Honda  in a desolate yard with Gothic-style fencing and withered trees, all created by  Solid Vision . She claimed that she wanted to make the Duel field appropriate for her master who slept in her Deck. Dark Yugi smirked that he would make the barren her master's graveyard in that case. Tilla wagered the card key Yugi would need to enter the next block of KaibaCorp for the " Soul Prison " containing  Anzu 's soul, which Tilla would need to claim her cash reward. She then explained that the bounty on Dark Yugi was currently at $100,000 (US) and patronized Jonouchi, who was only worth $10. [1] 
 
       " Vampire's Curse " sucking Tilla's blood.     
 Tilla managed to Summon the card she considered her master, " Vampire's Curse ". "Vampire's Curse" exhibited immortality by resurrecting itself when destroyed and would bite her on the neck to grow stronger when she paid his  Life Point   cost . She used " Evil Eye of Coercion " to force Dark Yugi's monsters to kneel before her master, allowing him to attack Dark Yugi  directly . However Dark Yugi used " Bounce " to transfer its effect to his side of the field, forcing "Vampire's Curse" to bow to his " Buster Blader ", allowing it to attack Tilla directly and win the Duel for Dark Yugi. [1] 
 After Tilla's loss, Jonouchi asked if he could borrow her  Duel Disk , and she lent it to him. [2] 
 Jonouchi later gave her the  Black Duel Disk  instead of the one he borrowed. She didn't seem to mind as she smiled and held it above her head admiringly.
 
 Deck 
 Tilla uses a " Vampire "  Deck  centered around her " Vampire's Curse ".
