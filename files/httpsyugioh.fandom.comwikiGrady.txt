 Biography 
       Grady as a Shadow Drone.     
 While listening to a group of Dark Signers preaching that the  Crimson Dragon  is evil, a thread of a spider's web drops onto Grady, allowing him to be possessed via one of  Roman's  spiders.
 Grady was sent to challenge  Yusei Fudo  to a Duel. He appeared outside  Blister's  hideout, where Yusei had been hiding from the paparazzi. While everyone else inside was asleep, Yusei's  Mark of the Dragon  began to react to something. Looking outside, he saw Grady with a  dark mark , similar to the Mark of the Dragon, glowing on his arm. Thinking he might be a  Signer , Yusei ran after him in search of answers.
 Grady led Yusei to a car park, where he imposed a Shadow Duel. Hoping he could get answers by Dueling him, Yusei accepted. Grady suprised Yusei by performing a  Dark Synchro Summon . Despite severly lowering Yusei's  Life Points , Grady was defeated.
 After the Duel, Grady had no recollection of the time he spent as a Shadow Drone. The spider left his body and his Deck began to glow, returning it to his original Deck, without the  Dark Synchro  and  Dark Tuner monsters .
 The reporter  Carly Carmine , who witnessed the Duel, tried to interview him (in the original, she recognized him as Dick Pitt). Although Grady had no memory, he managed to remember the thread of web being the last thing he saw before these events.
 Sector Security  appeared to assess the damage caused by the Shadow Duel. Yusei escaped before the Securities saw him, but Grady held Carly back, not wanting to face the Securities alone. He and Carly were both held for questioning after the Duel.
