Legendary Decks  are collectors' sets in the  Yu-Gi-Oh! Trading Card Game . Typically, each set is released once per year late in the year, and includes exactly three preconstructed  Decks . Sets may also include additional promotional cards, and the Decks and/or the promotional cards may include cards that are  TCG exclusive  or previously  OCG exclusive .
 The Legendary Decks sets include:
 
 Yugi's Legendary Decks 
 Legendary Decks II 
 Legendary Dragon Decks 
 Legendary Hero Decks 
 Thematically, this series may be considered the spiritual successor to the  Legendary Collection  series, being released at the same time each year following the fifth  Legendary Collection  set and costing the same amount.
 
 Trivia 
 The first set in this series was created as the  TCG  equivalent of the  OCG   Memories of the Duel King  sets, while Yugi's " Exodia " Deck in  Legendary Decks II  was based on the  OCG  product  Millennium Box Gold Edition . All subsequent Decks have been  TCG  original arrangements.
