 Featured Duel: Alexis Rhodes vs. Yuri 
       Alexis  vs.  Yuri .     
 Turn 1: Alexis 
 Alexis   activates  " Machine Angel Absolute Ritual ", letting her  Tribute  " Cyber "  monsters  from her  hand  or  field  or  return  "Cyber" monsters from her  Graveyard  to her  Deck  to  Ritual Summon  a " Cyber Angel "  Ritual Monster . She Tributes " Cyber Tutubon " from her hand to Ritual Summon " Cyber Angel Natasha " (1000/1000) in  Defense Position . As "Cyber Tutubon" was used for a Ritual Summon this  turn , its  effect  activates, letting her  add  a  Ritual Spell Card  from her Graveyard to her hand. She adds "Absolute Ritual" and activates it, returning "Tutubon" to her Deck to Ritual Summon a second copy of "Natasha" (1000/1000) in Defense Position. Alexis activates the effects of both copies of "Natasha", letting her  target  a monster she  controls  and gain  Life Points  equal to half its  ATK . She targets the other copy of "Natasha" both times (Alexis: 4000 → 4500 →  5000).
 Turn 2: Yuri 
 Yuri  activates the  Continuous Spell Card , " Ancient Gear Fortress ", preventing " Ancient Gear " monsters he controls from being targeted or  destroyed  by his opponent's card effects during the turn they are  Normal  or  Special Summoned . It will also prevent the opponent from activating any cards or effects in  response  to the activation of any "Ancient Gear" card. As he controls no monsters, Yuri activates " Ancient Gear Catapult ", letting him target and destroy a  face-up  card he controls and Special Summon an "Ancient Gear" monster from his Deck, ignoring the Summoning conditions. He destroys "Fortress" and Special Summons " Ancient Gear Gadget " (500/2000). As "Fortress" was destroyed, its effect activates, letting Yuri Special Summon an "Ancient Gear" monster from his hand or Graveyard, but he may not Special Summon any monsters for the rest of this turn except "Ancient Gear" monsters. He Special Summons " Ancient Gear Wyvern " from his hand in  Attack Position  (1700/1200). As it was Normal or Special Summoned, its effect activates, letting Yuri add an "Ancient Gear" monster from his Deck to his hand. He adds " Ancient Gear Reactor Dragon ". Yuri activates the effect of "Ancient Gear Gadget", letting him  declare  the name of another " Gadget " monster and change the name of "Ancient Gear Gadget" to that card's name until the  End Phase . He declares " Red Gadget ".
 Yuri Tributes "Wyvern" and "Gadget" to  Tribute Summon  "Reactor Dragon" (3000/3000) in Attack Position. "Reactor Dragon"  attacks  "Natasha". As another "Cyber" monster she controls is being attacked, Alexis activates the effect of the other "Natasha", which would  negate  the attack, but the effect of "Reactor Dragon" prevents the opponent from activating  Spell  or  Trap Card , and Monster Effects until the end of the  Damage Step . The attack continues and "Natasha" is destroyed, with the effect of "Reactor Dragon" inflicting  piercing   battle damage  as it was Tribute Summoned by Tributing an "Ancient Gear" monster (Alexis: 5000 → 3000). As "Reactor Dragon" was Tribute Summoned by Tributing a "Gadget" monster, it may attack twice per  Battle Phase . "Reactor Dragon" attacks and destroys the second "Natasha", inflicting piercing battle damage (Alexis: 3000 → 1000). Yuri  Sets  a card.
 Turn 3: Alexis 
Alexis activates the effect of the "Natasha" in her Graveyard,  banishing  another "Cyber Angel" monster from her Graveyard to Special Summon "Natasha" and take control of a monster her opponent controls. She banishes one copy of "Natasha", Special Summons the other copy (1000/1000) in Defense Position and takes control of "Reactor Dragon". Alexis activates the effect of "Natasha", increasing her Life Points by half the ATK of "Reactor Dragon" (Alexis: 1000 → 2500). Alexis begins to declare an attack, but Yuri activates his face-down " Unfinished Ancient Gear " before she can finish and allow the effect of "Reactor Dragon" to prevent the activation of cards. This lets him Special Summon an "Ancient Gear" monster from his hand in Defense Position, ignoring the Summoning conditions. That monster cannot be  destroyed by battle  this turn, but its ATK and  DEF  will be halved. He Special Summons " Ancient Gear Golem " (3000/3000 → 1500/1500).
 "Reactor Dragon" attacks "Golem", which is not destroyed by battle, but piercing battle damage is inflicted (Yuri: 4000 → 2500). "Reactor Dragon" attacks "Golem" a second time (Yuri: 2500 → 1000). Alexis activates the Continuous Spell Card " Fusion Destruction " by  sending  a " Polymerization " in her hand to the Graveyard. This lets her look at her opponent's  Deck  and banish up to three " Polymerization " and/or " Fusion " Spell/Trap Cards from it, then inflict 300  damage  for each one. She sends three copies of "Polymerization" (Yuri: 1000 → 100).
 Turn 4: Yuri 
Yuri activates " Ancient Gear Workshop ", letting him add an "Ancient Gear" monster from his Graveyard to his hand. He adds "Wyvern". He Normal Summons "Wyvern" (1700/1200), whose effect activates as it was Normal or Special Summoned, letting him add a "Ancient Gear" monster from his Deck to his hand. He adds " Ancient Gear Box " and subsequently discards it to activate " Super Polymerization " to  Fusion Summon  a  Fusion Monster  from his  Extra Deck , using monsters from either side of the  field  as  Materials . Cards or effects cannot be activated in response to this card's activation, preventing Alexis from activating the effect of "Fusion Destruction", which would let her negate its actvation. Yuri fuses "Golem" and "Wyvern" from his field with "Reactor Dragon" from Alexis' field to Fusion Summon " Ultimate Ancient Gear Golem " (4400/3400) in Attack Position. "Ultimate Golem" attacks and destroys "Natasha", with the effect of "Ultimate Golem" inflicting piercing battle damage (Alexis: 2500 → 0).
