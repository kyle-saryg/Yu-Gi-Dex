 Summary 
 Yuma  has 2000  Life Points , but wants to increase them some more before moving on to a  Duel Field  to continue.  Tori  tells him to calm down and  Astral  informs him that there are no Spell or Trap Points nearby that would increase his Life Points. With that option gone, he instead begins to search for an opponent as he continues down the tracks of the  Duel Coaster . Tori tells him to calm down again and Yuma veers onto the tracks that lead to the " Jungle Field ", where  Dextra  and  Vetrix  are ready to begin their  Duel . The face one-another from opposite ends of a pond. Dextra thinks to herself that fear grabbed her when she first saw Vetrix at the finals party. He is someone who would break apart things important to other people in an instant. Vetrix giggles, but Dextra says she will stop him and won't let him reach  Kite . Vetrix asks if she really cares about Kite that much and Dextra responds that she does - and she loves him. Vetrix laughs again.
 
       Mr. Heartland  cuts the feed, while pretending it was technical difficulties.     
 Mr. Heartland  announces that the two who will face-off at the "Jungle Field" are the former  World Duel Carnival  administrator Dextra and the mysterious boy, Vetrix. He explains that each field has a  Field Spell Card  pre-set on it, with each having different  effects . He wonders what will happen at the "Jungle Field". The feed is cut at the point and the monitors show only static. He wonders aloud what happened and apologizes to the crowd, ordering the staff to fix it as soon as possible. He laughs to himself, thinking that there's no way he'll allow the public to see this Duel.
 
       " Swallowtail Butterspy " and " Morpho Butterspy ".     
 The Duel begins, with Vetrix seeing that Dextra still has 8000 Life Points from the Duel Coaster, while Vetrix has 4000. He is surprised and chides Dextra for not acting like an adult. Dextra tells him that she'll defeat him no matter what the cost and explains what the "Jungle Field" does. If a player does not Summon or  Set  a  monster  from their  hand  during their  turn , they'll receive 1000  damage  during their  End Phase . Vetrix says she came here already knowing that and determines that it was she who kept Setting  Trap Cards  in his path on the Duel Coaster. Dextra says she'll take the first turn and  activates  " Dance of the Butterspy ", which lets her  Special Summon  two  Level  4 " Butterspy " monsters from her hand as there is a face-up Field Spell Card. She Special Summons " Morpho Butterspy " and " Swallowtail Butterspy ", both in  Attack Position . She immediately  overlays  them to  Xyz Summon  " Photon Papilloperative " in Attack Position.
 Vetrix is surprised to see such a quick Xyz Summon. Dextra says he'll now be facing three  Continuous Spell Cards . She activates " Butterfly Charm " and reiterates the effect of the "Jungle Field" before explaining that if a Summoned monster does not  attack , "Butterfly Charm" will  destroy  it. Vetrix says he'll attack then and Dextra asks if really thinks she'll let him do that. She activates " Elimigate " and explains that when a monster other than an " Assassin " monster attacks, it will automatically be destroyed. Vetrix sputters and Dextra tells him that his monsters will face instant destruction no matter what he does. Vetrix says that can't be and Dextra tells that that she isn't done yet. Vetrix's visible eye widens as Dextra plays " Butterfly Swarm " by  paying  2000 Life Points. She explains that she each time a monster they  control  is  sent  to the  Graveyard , its  controller  will take 1500 damage. Vetrix says that that means he'll take damage if he doesn't Summon a monster, it will be destroyed and he'll take even more damage. He says "Butterfly Swarm" inflicts 1500 damage at the expense of 2000 of its controller, so that's why Dextra saved up 8000. Dextra says that if he doesn't break her combo, he'll be consumed by the jungle in three turns.
 
       Dextra,  Kite  and  Nistro  fighting Mr. Heartland's Duel Robot.     
 Dextra thinks of Kite and how she met him. Many young Duelists were training to work for Mr. Heartland, fighting against a large robot. Six Duelists remain, including Kite, Dextra and  Nistro . Heartland says they must be exhausted, but tells them that from this suffering will rise this generation's elite Duelists. Nistro attempts to Summon a monster and Dextra tries to activate a Trap, but the robot blocks both moves. Heartland moves the robot's control dial up to the maximum level. The robot electrocutes both Nistro and Dextra and Heartland claims the equipment has gone haywire. He tells them that even if they fall from exhaustion, they must win through Dueling. The robot blasts Nistro against the wall and then targets Dextra again, with Nistro yelling her name.
 
         Mr. Heartland causes the robot to go berserk.     
 Kite intercepts the attack and Summons " Daybreaker ", telling it to attack  directly . It shuts the robot down with its sword, but the attack leaves Kite with a wound on his face (the blood is removed in the dub). Kite tells Dextra not to concern herself with him, adding that if she does, she'll lose herself. Later, Kite sits with  Hart  on a balcony. Dextra passes by and presses herself to the wall, listening in. A butterfly flies by and Kite catches it on his finger, telling Hart to look at it. Dextra says that Kite's true strength was always the fact that he never concerned himself with anyone but his brother. But even his smile looked sad. Dextra tells Vetrix that just as how Kite protects Hart, she will protect Kite - by fighting alone and not concerning herself with anyone else. Vetrix asks if he is the sacrifice for her love. Vetrix calls himself an idiot, laughing.
 Yuma's Duel Coaster has now entered the "Jungle Field" as well. Yuma, Tori and Astral exit the coaster to watch the Duel. Dextra glances at them, while Vetrix calls Yuma's name and begins to dance around, saying he's been caught in a huge trap. Yuma looks at Dextra's field and Astral says he understands. He reiterates Dextra's combo and Yuma calls it an amazing play. Astral says there is one way to avoid it though. Vetrix says that's correct and says he'll win no matter what the case. Astral seems once again surprised that Vetrix can perceive him. Vetrix thinks that due to Dextra's combo, he must Summon a monster. If he does so in Attack Position, the combo will take place. Vetrix says the answer is to Set a monster instead and does so, along with another card. He ends his turn there. Vetrix says her combo can't activate if his monster is in Defense Position. Dextra responds that there is no point to Vetrix doing anything at all - he cannot run from her or from the jungle.
 
         " Photon Papilloperative "  attacks  with " Vivid Swarm ".     
 During the  Standby Phase , Dextra pays 2000 Life Points to maintain "Butterfly Swarm", dropping her to 4000. She activates the effect of "Papilloperative",  detaching  an  Overlay Unit  to change Vetrix's monster to face-up Attack Position and have it lose 600  ATK . " Heraldic Beast Aberconway " appears, and its ATK drops from 1800 to 1200. Dextra orders "Papilloperative" to attack and destroy "Aberconway" with " Vivid Swarm ". Vetrix's Life Points drop to 3100, while the effect of "Butterfly Swarm" inflicts another 1500 damage as his monster was sent to the Graveyard, leaving him with 1600. Vetrix is blasted off his feet and Yuma yells that Dextra's combo is so cool. Dextra Sets a monster to end her turn.
 Vetrix asks if she really found the perfect combo with no weakness. Dextra again says that she won't let him get to Kite. Yuma looks confused and Vetrix asks if sacrificing her own life for him is really worth it. He asks if this is the power of love. Yuma looks confused about love and asks why Dextra would fight for Kite. Tori punches him in the stomach and says he has no manners (the actual punch is cut briefly from the dub, replaced with a black screen full of stars, and Tori says that Yuma is thick-headed instead). She blushes and says that the power of love sounds really amazing. Dextra asks if Vetrix understands. Even putting his monsters in Defense Position is no use. Vetrix's voice drops to a much more serious tone as he draws. He  Normal Summons  " Heraldic Beast Berners Falcon ". Dextra says he finally understands. "Butterfly Charm" activates, forcing "Berners Falcon" to attack, while "Elimigate" will destroy it. Glowing butterflies pull "Berners Falcon" through the gate and "Butterfly Swarm drops Vetrix's Life Points to 100. Yuma thinks Dextra may actually beat Vetrix. Dextra is so close and wonders if her win is now confirmed. Vetrix giggles and rises to his feet. He says the power of love sounds really great. He says he wants to know if her heart suffers from caring about Kite and tells her he will break that memory apart.
 
         Vetrix  uses " Advanced Heraldry Art " to use monsters in his  Graveyard  as  Overlay Units .     
 Vetrix activates " Advanced Heraldry Art ", letting him Xyz Summon using monsters in his Graveyard for Overlay Units. He overlays the Level 4 "Aberconway" and "Berners Falcon" to Xyz Summon " Number 8: Heraldic Beast Genom-Heritage " in Defense Position. Yuma and Astral are shocked that Vetrix has a "Number" card. Vetrix giggles again and ends his turn. Dextra says that " Number " or not, she'll finish him off within the next turn. As she pays 2000 more Life Points to maintain "Butterfly Swarm", she again yells she won't let him reach it. She activates the effect of "Papilloperative", detaching an Overlay Unit to switch "Genom-Heritage" to Attack Position and decrease its ATK from 2400 to 1800 using " Mystifying Menace ". Dextra says this is the end and has "Papilloperative" attack "Genom-Heritage" with "Vivid Swarm". Vetrix activates the effect of "Genom-Heritage", explaining he can detach an Overlay Unit to activate one of three effects. He says he will now steal her monster's name. "Genom-Heritage" snares "Papilloperative" and drains blood from it. "Genom-Heritage" changes form, now looking identical to "Papilloperative", but with its original head intact. With that, "Papilloperative" now has no name. Vetrix wonders what will happen now that it's no longer a "Papilloperative". Dextra says this can't be and Vetrix says the effect of "Elimigate" will activate now. "Papilloperative" is destroyed since it is nameless. Dextra says her combo has fallen apart and "Butterfly Swarm" activates as well, inflicting 1500 damage as her monster was sent to the Graveyard. Dextra is left with 500 Life Points.
 
         Vetrix's crest sets the field ablaze.     
 Vetrix's  crest  springs from his covered eye and engulfs the field in fire. Vetrix says he just thought of a good idea and his crest launches again. He says he will take Dextra's memories. Dextra screams as they are drained. Yuma asks if she's alright. He tells her not to lose to Vetrix's powers and to fight for Kite. She remembers him and says she won't concern herself with anyone else. She Normal Summons " Moonlit Papillon " and  Flip Summons  " Blue Mountain Butterspy ". She overlays them to Xyz Summon " Photon Alexandra Queen " in  Defense Position . Yuma is happy she hasn't given up. Dextra activates the effect of "Alexandra Queen", detaching all of its Overlay Units to  return  all monsters on the field to their  owners ' hands and inflict 500 damage to the controllers for each of their returned monsters. Astral says it will be a  Draw  and Dextra declares " Butterfly Effect ". Dextra says she doesn't need Life Points or her life as long as she remembers Kite. Vetrix says she sure is trying hard and tells her she will devour her heart and memories. He activates his face-down " Heraldry Record "  negating  the effect of "Alexandra Queen" as it was activated by detaching Overlay Units. Yuma says that can't be and Vetrix asks if its his turn. She says it is and yells that she doesn't want to forget Kite. Vetrix says her memories, consciousness and love are all being absorbed.
 
         Yuma  vows to defeat  Vetrix .     He tells Dextra to rest in peace and tells his "Photon Papilloperative" to attack "Photon Alexandra Queen". Yuma yells for him to stop as he declares "Butterfly Death Dance". He says the effect of "Butterfly Swarm" will now carry Dextra to the land of the dead. Her Life Points drop to 0. Just after the loss, Dextra apologizes to Kite for failing him, and his image in her head vanishes. Vetrix says that memories of love taste bad (Vetrix mentioning this is cut from the dub). Yuma yells Vetrix's name and Vetrix says that its Yuma's heart he will eat next time (in the dub, Vetrix simply tells Yuma that he will defeat him next and warns to get ready for it), while vanishing through a portal. Yuma runs to Dextra and she slumps sideways. She tells him to tell "that person" to remember her as teardrops form in her eyes (in the dub, Dextra says that she was thinking about someone, but couldn't remember who that person was). Astral says that that is Vetrix's power and Yuma says he will never forgive him.
