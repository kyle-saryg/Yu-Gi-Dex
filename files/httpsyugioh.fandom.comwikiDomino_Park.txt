      Domino Park     
 Domino Park  is an amusement park in  Domino City  where  Yugi  and  Téa  have their first "date" together. Téa spends most of the time trying to make the  other Yugi  appear, though much to her dismay he does not. When Téa accidentally goes on the Ferris Wheel where a bomber is hiding, the bomber threatens to implode the Ferris Wheel. Yami Yugi takes over by playing a card game and stops the bomber by winning. He saved Téa and the other passengers, one being the bomber who was caught.
