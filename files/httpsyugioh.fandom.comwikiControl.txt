 Control  (Japanese: コントロール  kontorōru ) refers to the side of the  field  a card is on. The card's controller is distinct from its  owner .
 Only a card's controller can look at it while it is  face-down . Unless otherwise specified, players can only use monsters they control as  Tributes ,  Synchro Materials  or  Xyz Materials . Players can only  attack  using monsters they control, and can only target monsters their opponent controls for an attack (or  attack directly ). Players can only change the  battle position  of monsters they control (except by effects), and can only activate the effects of monsters they control.
 
 Changing control 
 By default, cards remain under the control of their  owners , but several cards can  change control  of cards, such as " Change of Heart ", " Brain Control ", " Mind Control ", "" Creature Swap " and " Enemy Controller ". When a monster switches control, it is placed on the new controller's side of the field. The new controller of the card choose the appropriate  Zone  the card would be placed on.
 Some monsters, such as " Mataza the Zapper " and " Blindly Loyal Goblin ",  cannot change control .
 If a monster is treated as an  Equip Card , it is moved to the  Spell & Trap Card Zone  of the player who controls the effect that caused it to be treated as one, and thus that player becomes its controller. For example, if " Relinquished " takes control of an opposing " Ryu-Kishin ", it is placed in the Spell & Trap Card Zone of the controller of "Relinquished". Monsters that cannot change control cannot be equipped to monster in a way that would change their controller.
 Changing control only takes place when the monster is on the field. A monster  Special Summoned  from the opponent's  hand ,  Deck ,  Graveyard , or  Banished  Zone; such as by the effects of " Grapha, Dragon Lord of Dark World ", " Conscription ", " Goyo Guardian " and " Leviair the Sea Dragon ", respectively; is not considered to change control.
 If a control of a monster in an  Extra Monster Zone  changes to the other player, it will go to the new controller's  Main Monster Zone  instead. When a card  leaves the field , is returned to the  Main Deck , or is  detached , it is moved to the  owner 's  hand ,  Main Deck ,  Extra Deck  or  Banished  Zone (depending on where the card would be sent), regardless of controller.
