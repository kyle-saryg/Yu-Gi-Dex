 Mechanics 
 The  control  of the monsters, including the monsters in the Extra Monster Zones, does not matter in creating Extra Link, as long as they are "a series of Co-link connecting both Extra Monster Zones".
 All  monsters  that make up the Extra Link, and any additional monsters co-linked with those monsters, are considered to be Extra Linked.
 It is possible to create an Extra Link using fewer than five monsters by co-linking them diagonally, resulting in a "V" shaped Extra Link. [1] 
 
 Controlling both Extra Monster Zones 
 Normally, each player can only use an Extra Monster Zone at a time. But when both Extra Monster Zones have been bound together, a new monster can be summoned to the other! Extra Link!! 
 —  Varis , regarding the advantage of Extra Link [2] 
 
 Normally, a player can only use 1 Extra Monster Zone at a time. However, if a player would Summon a new Link Monster to an Extra Monster Zone, and the Summon would create an Extra Link even if the player has already controlled one, it is legal.
 
 Examples 
 Set-up for creating an Extra Link using the player's own monsters Extra Linking the player's own monsters to control both Extra Monster Zones Extra Linking the opponent's monsters to control both Extra Monster Zones

 Trivia 
           
 In the  anime , during a  Master Duel , when someone is able to use all 5 of their  Main Monster Zones  as well as the 2 Extra Monster Zones to create an Extra Link without having a  Link Arrow  point towards the opponent's field, it is referred as "Extra Link - Full Mode". 
 Currently, no cards in the OCG or TCG  Advanced Format  that mention Extra Linking in their effects are playable. "Topologic Gumblar Dragon" is  Forbidden ; the rest are  Illegal   match winners .
