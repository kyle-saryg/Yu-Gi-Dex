 This card's name is derived from the concept of a " Heel ", a "bad guy" character in  professional wrestling . "Heel" characters are scripted to illicit contempt from the audience– often by breaking the rules or behaving immorally– in order to play a stronger foil to the " Face " ("good guy" characters). In  Lucha libre  wrestling, heels often pattern their costumes on trickster, demonic or devil characters, which corresponds with the "Devil" in this monster's Japanese name. 
 This  monster  appears in the artworks of " Set Rotation ", " Abyss Improv ", " Abyss Playhouse - Fantastic Theater ", " Abyss Actors' Curtain Call ", and " Stand In ".
