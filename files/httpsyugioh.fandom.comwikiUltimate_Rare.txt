 Ultimate Rare  (アルティメットレア  Arutimetto Rea , often simply  Ultimate , or unofficially  Ulti ) cards have an "embossed" foil on the Card Artwork, including the borders of artworks,  Attribute  icon, and on  Monster Cards , the  Level  stars. The card name is printed gold, like an  Ultra Rare . This card rarity is very hard for  Scalers  to find, since the card has a weight comparable to that of a  Common . In the  TCG , cards printed at Ultimate Rare are also printed at a lower rarity in the same booster with the same card number, but in the  OCG  this does not occur.
 When they were first introduced in the  TCG , Ultimate Rare cards often only had partial foil on the card artwork, usually only on the background. Starting partially in  Soul of the Duelist  and from  Enemy of Justice  onwards, the entire picture was embossed in foil. From  Duelist Revolution  onward, the card border and the lore text border are embossed in foil as well. With the introduction of  Pendulum Monsters , Ultimate Rare monsters'  Pendulum Scales  are embossed in foil as well. Some cards have a pattern in their foiling as well, such as stripes in fire, or a curvy pattern in some backgrounds.
 When an Ultimate Rare is scanned, the embossed image may be muted and the image indistinct from the background.  OCG  Ultimate Rares tend to scan much better than their  TCG  counterparts, due to a slightly reflective coating present on all  OCG  cards (but lacking on  TCG  cards). This has the advantage of brightening the image, and making the foil image more distinct than on a  TCG  equivalent.
 On the market, Ultimate Rare cards are often much more valuable than others, even if their effectiveness in the game is only above average. However, Ultra Rare versions of cover cards are usually more popular than that of their Ultimate Rare counterparts.
 Starting with  Breakers of Shadow , Ultimate Rares have been moved exclusively to tournament packs. [1]
