 Biography 
 He first appears in  episode 103 , where he, along with his teammates  Hans  and  Hermann , are celebrating their automatic victory against  Team Unicorn  due to two of their members crashing. In  episode 104 , he gained a little more backstory; in a flashback he is shown talking to  Primo , who has just given him a " Hook the Hidden Knight " card. He guaranteed him that if he used it, he would become King. Although his other teammates said that they shouldn't be using something like that to Duel, he ignored them and said that he would do anything to get out of the dump of a home where he lives. This shows that he must be living at an undeveloped part of  Satellite . In the  WRGP , Nicolas is first seen by  Yusei  and co-smirking at the injured Team Unicorn members. Seeing this Yusei, decided to believe something is wrong so after a little digging he found out that they were using a dark card to destroy people's Duel Runners in the WRGP so they could proceed through. Seeing as  Andre  Dueled first against Nicolas and then  Jean  was Dueling Hermann it is presumed that he lost against Jean. In  episode 105 , he Dueled  Jack Atlas , he tried to use the  Trap Card , " Doom Ray ", to try and beat Jack. But Jack's monster, " Power Giant ", had an effect to negate the damage, causing Nicolas to lose in one turn. It is revealed his Trap Card was known as a dark card, and it began to release demons which attacked Jack and Nicolas'  Duel Runners . Jack destroyed the demons using his "Power Giant" and rescued Nicolas before his Runner exploded. After the Duel, Nicolas asked Jack why he saved his life, to which Jack answers he's not worth being killed. He then tells Nicolas that a Duel is a clash between souls, and adds that someone who doesn't believe in their own cards and instead uses cards of darkness doesn't deserve to Duel. Since Nicolas's Runner was destroyed, he could not pass the baton to  Hans  thus causing  Team Catastrophe  to lose by default. He was last seen being questioned by Sherry as to where he obtained the shadow cards.  
 
 Deck 
 Not much of Nicolas' Deck was shown, but he used two cards given to the team by  Primo , " Hook the Hidden Knight " and " Doom Ray ".
