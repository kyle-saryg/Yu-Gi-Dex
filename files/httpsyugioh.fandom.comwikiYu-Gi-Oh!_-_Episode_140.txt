 Notes 
 In this episode,  Yami Marik   activates  " Metal Reflect Slime " after  Yami Yugi   attacks  him with " Obelisk the Tormentor ", which Summons a " Slime Token " that takes the shape of "Obelisk". 
 Featured Duel: Yami Marik vs. Yami Yugi - Part 3 
 Duel continues from previous episode. 
 Yami Yugi has 2300  Life Points  remaining and controls "Obelisk the Tormentor (4000/4000) in Attack Position and no set cards.
 Yami Marik has 4700 Life Points remaining and controls two set cards.
 Turn 8: Yami Yugi 
 Yami Yugi  has just  attacked   directly  with " Obelisk the Tormentor " ( Yami Marik  4700 → 700). Since he just lost over half of his  Life Points  in  Battle Damage , Yami Marik  activates  his face-down " Metal Reflect Slime ", which Special Summons a " Slime Token " with  DEF  equal to 3/4 the ATK of the opponent's attacking monster (0/3000). Yami Yugi Sets a card (" Magical Dimension ").
 Turn 9: Yami Marik 
Yami Marik draws "Revival Jam". Aside from "Revival Jam", the other cards that are in Yami Marik's hand include "Jam Defender", " Polymerization ", " Swallowtail Spike Lizard ", " Class System ", " Bait Doll ", and " The Mask of Remnants ". Yami Marik then Normal Summons " Revival Jam " (1500/500) in Defense Position. He then activates "Polymerization" to fuse the "Slime Token"  with "Revival Jam" in order to Fusion Summon " Egyptian God Slime " (?/?) in Defense Position. Due to the effect of "Egyptian God Slime", its  ATK  and  DEF  become equal to the DEF of "Metal Reflect Slime" ("Egyptian God Slime": ? → 3000/? → 3000). It is also treated as "Revival Jam" while face-up on the field.
 Turn 10: Yami Yugi 
Yami Yugi draws " Big Shield Gardna " and subsequently Normal Summons it (100/2600) in  Defense Position . "Obelisk the Tormentor" attacks and  destroys  "Egyptian God Slime". Yami Marik activates the effect of "Egyptian God Slime" to revive itself (3000/3000) in  Defense Position .
 Turn 11: Yami Marik 
Yami Marik draws. He then  Sets  a card and Normal Summons " Bowganian " (1300/1000) in  Defense Position . While this monster is face-up, Yugi will take 300 damage during each of his End Phases.
 Turn 12: Yami Yugi 
Yami Yugi draws a card and subsequently sets it (" Soul Taker "). He then  Tributes  "Big Shield Gardna" in order to  Tribute Summon  " Dark Magician Girl " (2000/1700) in Attack Position. "Dark Magician Girl" attacks "Bowganian", but Marik activates his face-down " Jam Defender ", which redirects the attack to "Egyptian God Slime". The attack fails ( Yami Yugi  2300 → 1300). On the End Phase, the effect of "Bowganian" activates ( Yami Yugi  1300 → 1000). 
 Turn 13: Yami Marik 
Yami Marik draws " Mining for Magical Stones " and subsequently activates it to  discard  two cards and add " Monster Reborn " from his  Graveyard  to his  hand , however Yami Marik is forbidden from activating the returned card this turn.
 Duel continues next episode.
