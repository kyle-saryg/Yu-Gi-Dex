As Yuga and Luke search around the city together with Kan and his friends, they realize that Kan is looking for Gossie not just cause of his interest in the dino but also has another goal in mind.

 Turn 1: Kan 
 Kan activates " Mysterious Sea ", allowing him to Special Summon 3 Level 4 or lower WATER monsters from his hand and draw 1 card. He Special Summons " King of Trilobites " (400/300), " Arma Knight " (1000/1200), and " Ichthyosteguard " (0/1500), all in Defense Position, then draws 1 card. Kan activates the effect of "King of Trilobites", allowing him to draw 1 card since he controls a WATER Aqua Normal Monster, but he cannot attack for the rest of this turn. Kan Sets 3 Cards.
 Turn 2: Yuga 
 Yuga Normal Summons " Dark Sorcerer " (1500/0) and " Child of Wind, Cyc " (400/600). Yuga Tributes "Dark Sorcerer" to Tribute Summon " Windcaster Torna " (1600/1000). Yuga activates the effect of "Cyc", allowing him to add a Level 4 or lower Spellcaster monster from his GY to his hand since he controls another WIND Spellcaster monster. He adds "Dark Sorcerer" to his hand. Yuga Normal Summons "Dark Sorcerer" (1500/0). Yuga activates the effect of "Torna", allowing him to send a card from his hand to the GY to change the battle position of a monster Kan controls. He sends " Kuribot " from his hand to the GY and switches "Ichthyosteguard" to Attack Position. Yuga Sets 1 Card. "Cyc" attacks and destroys "King of Trilobites". "Dark Sorcerer" attacks and destroys "Arma Knight". "Torna" attacks and destroys "Ichthyosteguard" (Kan: 4000 → 2400 LP). 
 Turn 3: Kan 
 Kan Normal Summons " Stegoceratops " (700/1100) and " Little D " (1100/700). He then Tributes both "Stegoceratops" and "Little D" to Tribute Summon 2 copies of " Megazowler " (1800/2000). Kan activates his Set " Miraculous Co-Evolution ", allowing him to send a Dinosaur monster from his field to the GY to Special Summon a Dinosaur monster from his hand, and if he does, the Special Summoned monster gains ATK equal to the Level of the monster sent to the GY x100 until the end of this turn. He sends a "Megazowler" to the GY and Special Summons " Super King Rex " (2500/2000 → 3100/2000) in Attack Position. Kan activates the effect of "Super King Rex": since it was Special Summoned this turn, he can send the top card of his Deck to the GY to Special Summon a Level 6 or lower Dinosaur Normal Monster from his GY. He sends " Mammoth Graveyard " from the top of his Deck to the GY and Special Summons "Megazowler" (1800/2000) in Attack Position. The two copies "Megazowler" attack and destroy "Torna" and "Dark Sorcerer" (Yuga: 4000 → 3800 → 3500 LP). "Super King Rex" attacks and destroys "Cyc" (Yuga: 3500 → 800 LP).
 Turn 4: Yuga 
 Yuga Normal Summons "Kuribot" (300/200). Since Yuga controls no other monsters, he activates the effect of "Kuribot", allowing him to pay 500 LP (Yuga: 800 → 300 LP) to add another copy of "Kuribot" from his GY to his hand. Yuga Normal Summons 2 copies of "Kuribot" (300/200). Yuga Tributes 2 "Kuribot" to Tribute Summon "Sevens Road Magician" (2100/1500). Since Yuga Normal Summoned a Level 7 or higher monster, Kan activates his face-down " Transcendental Evolution ", allowing him to choose a Dinosaur monster he controls and increase its ATK by 1500, as well as prevent it from being destroyed by card effects for the rest of the turn. He chooses "Super King Rex" ("Super King Rex": 2500/2000 → 4000/2000). Since a card was sent to Kan's GY, he activates his face-down " Top of the Predatory Evolution ", allowing him to choose a Dinosaur monster he controls and force Yuga to attack that monster this turn. He chooses "Super King Rex".
 Yuga Normal Summons "Mystic Dealer" (1000/0). He then activates the effect of "Mystic Dealer", allowing him to send a Spellcaster monster from his hand to the GY to draw 1 card. He sends " Magical Beast Wolfram " to the GY and draws " Fullmeteor Impact ". Yuga Tributes "Kuribot" and "Mystic Dealer" to Tribute Summon "Fullmeteor Impact" (2500/0). Since "Fullmeteor Impact" was Normal Summoned this turn and Yuga controls a Level 7 or higher Spellcaster monster, he activates its effect, sending it to the GY to destroy all Level 6 or higher monsters Kan controls. The two copies "Megazowler" are destroyed, but due to the effect of "Transcendental Evolution", "Super King Rex" is not destroyed. Yuga activates his face-down " Kuribottriple ", allowing him to shuffle 3 copies of "Kuribot" from his GY into his Deck to draw 2 cards. Yuga draws " Road Magic - Diastrophism " and " Stray Familiar ". Since Yuga controls a Level 7 or higher Spellcaster monster, he activates "Road Magic - Diastrophism", allowing him to send an EARTH monster from his hand to the GY to decrease the ATK of a monster Kan controls by the ATK of the monster in Yuga's GY with the highest ATK. He sends "Stray Familiar" to the GY and chooses "Super King Rex", with "Fullmeteor Impact" being the monster with the highest ATK in Yuga's GY ("Super King Rex": 4000/2000 → 1500/2000). Yuga activates the effect of "Sevens Road Magician", allowing him to send the top card of his Deck to the GY to increase its ATK by 300 for each monster with a different Attribute in his GY. He sends " Luminous Shaman " to the GY, so there are 6 monsters with different Attributes in his GY ("Sevens Road Magician": 2100/1500 → 3900/1500). "Sevens Road Magician" attacks and destroys "Super King Rex" (Kan: 2400 → 0 LP).
