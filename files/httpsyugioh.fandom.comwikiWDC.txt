 Purpose 
 The World Duel Carnival is really a plan designed by  Mr. Heartland  and  Dr. Faker  to find  Number holders  so that  Kite Tenjo  can hunt them more efficiently. If the latter wins the tournament, they will gather most of the "Number" cards. [2]  Unfortunately, Kite was defeated in his Duel with Vetrix due to his " Number 69: Heraldry Crest " [3] , but Dr. Faker still allows the tournament to go as planned because the  Sphere Field  has the power to take "Numbers" from any holder regardless of the winner or loser. [4]  The effect still remains the same due to Vetrix taking Kite's numbers from him.
 Others besides Dr. Faker and Mr. Heartland who know or at least suspect the real purpose of this tournament such as  Vetrix  and  Astral  are also using it to collect "Numbers".
 
 Organization 
 Monitoring 
 Dextra  and  Nistro  are acting as referees of the tournament [5]  and punish Duelists who cheated. [6]  However, their true task is the search of " Number " cards [6] , much like the  Battle City  tournament was used to search for  Egyptian God  monsters.
 They are also involved in investigated incidents during the tournament and may decide whether something is allowed, as was the case with  Tombo Tillbitty 's  Basket Rules . [5] 
 If they discover someone cheated, they have authority to decide what kind of punishment the person will get, even if said punishment would be a physical one. For example, Nistro forced a boy into a  Duel  and ordered him to disappear from  Heartland City . Next, he made  Flip  eat all his "Heart Piece" candies and bound him with a rope. Nistro threatened he would confiscate his deck, while Flip would be disqualified and deprived from all future participation in the tournaments for the rest of his life. Additionally, he claimed he would make sure Flip never Dueled again by beating him out of Heartland City. [6] 
 
 Special rules 
 Having their own special rules in a Duel is not allowed. However, such rules can be approved by the referee, as was the case with  Tombo Tillbitty 's  Basket Rule . [5] 
 
 Flow of the tournament 
 Preliminaries 
 The preliminaries happen for three days in  Heartland City , and each  Duelist  must accept all challenges. The tournament has an  ante rule  of betting their  Heart Pieces  and if all pieces are lost, the participant will be automatically disqualified. In order to enter the finals, the Duelist must gather five correct Heart Pieces to make a perfect heart. [7] 
 The tournament begun with more than 10,000 participants. Only 24 Duelists were able to complete their Heart Pieces. Trey was a finalist but could not participate in the semi-finals due to him being in a coma after being defeated by Yuma and Astral, therefore only 23 Duelists advanced to the finals.
 
 Finals 
 First Stage 
 The first stage of the finals is called SkyScape section known as the Park Section in the Japanese version, which occurs all throughout  Heartland . The Duelists use the  Duel Coaster  system which works similarly to a  Battle Royal  Duel. The Duelists ride the Duel Coaster and Duel if another Duelist is on the same lane. Multiple Duelists can Duel against the same opponent and several parts of the lanes have  Spell / Trap Cards  set which activate when the Duelist crosses over them. [8] 
 Those who remain from the 23 finalists will pass to the next course of the Duel Coaster which is the underground section called Dragon's Den.
 
 Second Stage 
 The second stage consists of one-on-one battles, which happen in  special fields :  magma, space, jungle, and canyon. There seem to be beneficial uses with these fields as some Duelists, such as Dextra and Quattro, state that they can put their opponents at disadvantages with these locations. [9]  Whatever value of  Life Points  each player had at the end of the Duel Coaster becomes their starting Life Points for the quarterfinals match-ups. The  Duel Fields  are treated as  Field Spell Cards  and provide various  effects  which affect both  Duelists . [10]

 Semi-Finals 
 The semifinals of the World Duel Carnival take place on the  Duel Tower  that's situated inside the Duel Stadium.
 
 Finals 
 The finals continue on the top of Duel Tower where both finalists Duel in the  Sphere Field . It is part of  Dr. Faker 's plan to draw out the power of " Numbers ". [4]
