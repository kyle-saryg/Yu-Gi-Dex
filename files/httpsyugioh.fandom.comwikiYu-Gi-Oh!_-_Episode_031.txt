 Summary 
 The first  Duel  of the  Duelist Kingdom  finals has concluded.  Yugi Muto  has defeated  Mai Valentine  and will be Dueling the winner of the next Duel,  Joey Wheeler  vs.  Bandit Keith . Joey confronts Yugi saying that if he wins, he will face him. As Joey arrives in the arena, he notices Keith is not in the arena, rather he is sitting on a couch outside the arena. When  Croquet  asks both contestants to show their tournament entry cards, Keith shows the one he took from Joey. So naturally, when Joey reaches for his, he can't find it. He has five minutes to find that card or he will be disqualified. Joey searches all over his room for it, but to no avail. He is just about to give up when Mai comes in and gives him her card. He arrives at the  Dueling Arena  just in the nick of time and presents Mai's card, to Keith's shock.
 The Duel between Joey and Bandit Keith begins, and Keith is revealed to be using a  Machine - Type   Deck  after using  Pendulum Machine  to destroy Joey's  Battle Warrior . Unknown to Joey, Keith's Machine monsters are immune to non-physical attacks, and when Joey's first attack from  Giltia the D. Knight 's Soul Spear fails due to this, he is left exposed and takes damage from Keith's  Launcher Spider . After Joey sets a card and a Monster, Keith lures him into opening his defenses again by moving to  Set  a monster and "accidentally" dropping it. Joey recognizes it as a non-Machine and seizes the opportunity for a powerful magical attack via a combo of  Flame Swordsman  and  Salamandra , but Yugi and  Bakura  realize that the monster, " Zoa ", has  ATK  that is not only higher than its  DEF , but also higher than the ATK of any other  monster  on the  field . The only reason to Set a monster like that in  Defense Position  is as a lure.
 But it is too late to warn Joey, who falls into the trap and takes heavy damage after Zoa, with the power of  Magic Metal Force , transforms into  Metalzoa . Just as Keith prepares to deliver the final blow, his  attack  gets stopped, and everyone is thunderstruck to see that Joey also had a trap and just knocked out the strongest monster on Keith's field. On his next turn, Joey sets another card and announces that it is a  Trap Card . He also begins a counterattack and taunts Keith in his inimitably grating fashion. Next Joey summons  Garoozis  and destroys Pendulum Machine. Enraged at Joey's mockery and presumption, Keith attacks, but it wasn't a bluff as Joey activates  Kunai with Chain , costing him the last monster on his field. With a handful of low- Level  monsters and his own Dueling style, Joey has turned the Duel into a neck-to-neck battle, but Keith knows that this Duel is far from over. Will Joey defeat Keith and his mighty Machine monsters, or will he be eliminated and lose his chance to save his sister,  Serenity Wheeler ?

 Differences in adaptations 
 The shot of "Pendulum Machine" dragging "Battle Warrior" up to his feet then slicing him in half is cut from the dub, and is replaced by white slashes diagonally left and right. 
 When  Croquet  announces the duel, cut from the dub is a bit where Tristan tells Joey to be calm, advising him to write something three times on his palm to relax himself. A wound-up Joey tells Tristan he's only making him more nervous, and smacks him. 
 The Japanese version of the episode ends upon Joey taunting Keith after destroying his "Launcher Spider". The English dub adds in a short scene of Keith lashing out at Joey for getting too overconfident, using footage that is lifted from the next episode. 
 Mistakes 
 After Joey destroys "Launcher Spider" with "Garoozis", "Flame Swordsman" is seen on his field in Defense Position instead of "Axe Raider".
