 " Swords of Concealing Light ", " Desertapir ", " Book of Moon ", " Tsukuyomi " and (to a lesser extent) " Reversible Beetle ” can be used to switch opposing monster(s) to face-down Defense Position. With these effects in mind, cards that enable  Piercing  Damage, including “ Fairy Meteor Crush ” or controlling " Cross-Sword Beetle ”, are essential. 
 This card's own self-setting effect is meant to protect its controller from damage should it be attacked, due to having only 300 ATK.
