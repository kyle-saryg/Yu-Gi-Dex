 Beast-Warrior  (Japanese:  獣 戦 士   Jūsenshi ) is a  Type  of   monster  that usually resembles anthropomorphic animals or other half-man, half-animal creatures such as centaurs. Their  effects  generally apply after  destroying  a monster, and help them destroy monsters more easily. Many of their effects also deal with  Normal Monsters . However, a lot of their effects tend to give an advantage during battle, like " Exarion Universe " and " Enraged Battle Ox ".  Devon Knox 's  Main Deck  in  Yu-Gi-Oh! ZEXAL  is primarily composed of these monsters, while  Celina  uses them in  Yu-Gi-Oh! ARC-V .
 Beast-Warrior are  neither   Beast  nor  Warrior - Type  monsters, so they are not affected by  effects  that specifically affect Beast or Warrior-Type monsters (though occasionally, support cards for either will also specifically include Beast-Warriors, such as "Enraged Battle Ox"). 
 " Phantom Beast " was the only primarily Beast-Warrior  archetype  until 2012.  Cosmo Blazer  saw the release of the " Fire Fist " archetype, which also included a potent searcher for Beast-Warriors; " Fire Formation - Tenki ". From that point on Beast-Warriors have remained consistently powerful; the " Lunalight ", " Zoodiac " and " Ancient Warriors " archetypes would later follow in coming years. Some can be also found in the " Gladiator Beast ", " X-Saber " and " Yosenju " archetypes. Other notable monsters include " Reborn Tengu ", " XX-Saber Gottoms ", " Manticore of Darkness ", " Mystical Knight of Jackal ",  " Cat's Ear Tribe ", " Chiron the Mage ", " Exarion Universe ", " Ghost Knight of Jackal ", " Enraged Battle Ox ", " Pitch-Black Warwolf ", " Indomitable Fighter Lei Lei ", " Lycanthrope ", " Shiba-Warrior Taro ", " Mother Grizzly ", " Beast King Barbaros ", " Panther Warrior ", and " Thor, Lord of the Aesir ".
 In  Yu-Gi-Oh! The Falsebound Kingdom , Beast-Warrior-Type monsters are treated as Warrior-Type monsters.
Like the  Thunder -Type, the Beast-Warrior-Type gains advantage from the two  Field Spell Cards  that increase the ATK and DEF of monster-Types; " Sogen " and " Forest ".
