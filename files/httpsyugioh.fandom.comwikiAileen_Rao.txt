 Aileen Rao  is a Canadian-Indian supermodel and the third game master. She is skilled in reading and manipulating the psychology of others; she also has a pet tiger.
 Seto Kaiba  tells Aileen, who returns from a Paris fashion show, to play a game against  Yugi Mutou . Aileen first challenges  Hirata  to a game of  Raijinhai . Aileen states that if he wins, she will submit to his will, but if Aileen wins, Hirata will lose the most important thing to him. Aileen wins and Hirata is seen injured in a hospital on TV. Aileen lures Yugi and  Anzu Mazaki , who is a big fan of Aileen, to her condominium. Aileen freezes Anzu solid with a hypnotic suggestion and forces Yugi to play Raijinhai. Aileen tells the same thing to Yugi: if he loses, he will lose the most important thing to him. After a practice match that ends in a draw, Aileen threatens to kill Anzu with a tiger if Yugi loses, and nearly wins. Yugi eventually wins and Aileen releases Anzu, though he acknowledges her strength in games. Aileen admits that she used hypnotic suggestions to make her victims think they'd lost whatever was important to them.
 Afterward, Aileen acknowledges Yugi as a worthy opponent and develops respect for him. Seto Kaiba then fires her for failing to defeat Yugi and for claiming Yugi's stronger than him, and she parts on good terms with Yugi and Anzu. 
 Later, during the final Death-T episode, Aileen and  Ryuichi Fuha  are paired against  Miho Nosaka  and  Katsuya Jonouchi  in a fighting game, with no explanation for why Aileen is working for Kaiba again. Jonouchi and Aileen have battle suits while Miho and Fuha are at the controls. Jonouchi and Miho defeat Aileen and Ryuichi.
