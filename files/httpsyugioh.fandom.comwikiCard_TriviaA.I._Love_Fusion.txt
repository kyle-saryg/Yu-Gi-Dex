 Two  Ai 's with different colors appear in this card's artwork (one red and the other blue). Their colors combine into the violet of both the original Ai and  Fusion Monster  cards. 
 This card's name is a pun on the phrase "I love you", "Ai", and "Fusion".
 This, in conjunction with the  monster  it was used to summon, could potentially represent  Earth 's feelings towards  Aqua . 
 The word "ai" itself can mean "love" in Japanese (æ„›). 
 This card has three  counterparts .
 Cynet : " Cynet Fusion " 
 Ritual : " A.I.'s Ritual " 
 Salamangreat : " Fusion of Fire "
