French  cards are  TCG  cards printed in the French language, and distributed in French-speaking territories under the brand  Yu-Gi-Oh! Jeu de Cartes à Jouer . Its regional ID was  F , and also  C  in Canada; the ID was changed to  FR  for all territories.
 One notable trend in the French  TCG  is to translate some early card names directly from Japanese, rather than from the heavily modified English names. Some examples of cards with such names include " Goblin Calligrapher ", " Il Blud ", " Phalanx Pike ", some " Worm " cards, " Lightsworn " cards, etc. Notably, the French version frequently uses the words  dieu  ("god") and  Dieu  ("God"), such as in the name of " Mound of the Bound Creator ", even though these words are usually substituted for religious-friendlier alternatives such as "lord", "deity" or "divine".
