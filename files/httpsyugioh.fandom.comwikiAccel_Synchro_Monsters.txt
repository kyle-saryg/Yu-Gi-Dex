 Accel Synchro Monsters  (アクセルシンクロ  Akuserushinkuro ) are an anime-exclusive sub-type of  Synchro Monsters  that can only be  Synchro Summoned  by using 1  Tuner Synchro Monster  and 1 or more non-Tuner  Synchro Monsters . This type of Synchro Summon is referred to as an " Accel Synchro Summon " in the anime. Accel Synchro Monsters first appeared on  episode 74 , being used by the duelist  Bruno  who was known at that time as Vizor.
 Performing an Accel Synchro Summon is treated as  Spell Speed 2 , as Vizor is able to chain his Accel Synchro Summon to  Yusei 's activation of a card effect during Yusei's own turn. This, coupled with the individual effects of the Accel Synchro Monsters, provide a defense against effects that target Synchro Monsters, such as but not limited to the " Meklord Emperor " monsters, leading Yusei and the rest of  Team 5D's  to pursue the secrets behind Accel Synchro Summoning during the events leading up to, and during, the  World Racing Grand Prix .
 In the anime, in episode 74, it is hinted that Accel Synchro Monsters have other unknown abilities, due to Vizor saying he is not as good a person up to the point of revealing all the secrets of Accel Synchro Monsters (though this may have been hinting at  Delta Accel Synchro Summon ).
 Delta Accel Synchro Monsters  and  Limit Over Accel Synchro Monsters  are more powerful subtypes of Accel Synchro Monsters.
 
 In the  TCG / OCG 
 When Accel Synchro Monsters were printed in the  OCG  and  TCG , they were changed to regular Synchro Monsters. The first, " Shooting Star Dragon ", premiered as the  cover card  in the booster pack  Starstrike Blast . The set also contained the first printed  Tuner Synchro Monster , " Formula Synchron ".

 Additionally, there are some Synchro Monsters that require Synchro Monsters as their Synchro Material, but have never appeared in the anime (the only medium in which Accel Synchro Monsters exist). The only Accel Synchro Monster to be confirmed outside of the anime is " Stardust Warrior ".
 
 See list  Requires both Tuner and non-Tuner Synchro Monsters as Synchro Materials .  . 
 Example 
 
 Trivia 
 The stats of  Yusei 's Accel Synchro Monsters seem to be based on  Bruno 's comparable monsters.
