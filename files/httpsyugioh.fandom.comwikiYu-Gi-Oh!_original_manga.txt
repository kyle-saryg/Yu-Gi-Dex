 Yu-Gi-Oh!  is a manga series about games by  Kazuki Takahashi , which the entire  Yu-Gi-Oh!  franchise originated from.
 It was serialized in Shueisha's  Weekly Shonen Jump  from September 14, 1996 to March 8, 2004. 343 chapters were published. These were reprinted in 38 volumes in the tankoban and 22 in the  bunkoban .
 The story was initially episodic, with a few exceptions. It focused on the adventures of  Yugi Mutou , who would unknowingly become possessed by  Dark Yugi  and defeat bullies and evildoers in dangerous  Shadow Games . The story later focuses more on the card game  Duel Monsters  as a plot device in two tournament arcs and stories spanning over many more chapters. In the final arc, Dark Yugi relives his past life as a Pharaoh through a role-playing game, the  Shadow RPG .
 The English version is subdivided into three series;  Yu-Gi-Oh! ,  Yu-Gi-Oh! Duelist  and  Yu-Gi-Oh! Millennium World . A number of minor changes are made, but significantly less than in other English adaptions of  Yu-Gi-Oh!  media.

 Adaptations 
 English edition 
 The manga's first English print was in the  Shonen Jump  magazine. This published  chapters 1  to  59 , the entire story before Duelist Kingdom. A while later, it published  chapters 279  to  343 , the Pharaoh's Memory arc, labeling it  Yu-Gi-Oh! Millennium World  and resetting the numbering to 1. The entire series was released in tankōbon format as  Yu-Gi-Oh! ,  Yu-Gi-Oh! Duelist  and  Yu-Gi-Oh! Millennium World .
 
 Yu-Gi-Oh!  contains volumes 1 to 7, chapters 1 to 59. 
 Yu-Gi-Oh! Duelist  contains volumes 8 to 31, chapters 60 to 278, but renumbers them as volumes 1 to 24 and chapters 1 to 219. 
 Yu-Gi-Oh! Millennium World  contains volumes 32 to 38, chapters 279 to 343, but renumbers them as volumes 1 to 7 and chapters 1 to 65. 
 Unlike most English adaptions of  Yu-Gi-Oh!  media, the English version uses the Japanese names for the majority of human characters and features significantly less censoring.
 Some changes that are made include:
 
 A few names are changed; some to suit the English card game or English anime and some due to censorship.
 The name  Magic & Wizards  is changed to  Duel Monsters  in the tankōbon, despite being called  Magic & Wizards  when it was printed in  Shonen Jump . 
 Some cards have their real life  Yu-Gi-Oh! Trading Card Game  effect printed on them, rather than a translation of their Japanese manga effect. 
 Mokuba Kaiba  sometimes calls his brother  Seto Kaiba , by his surname. 
 The  Yu-Gi-Oh! Duelist  tankōbon features a "Master of the Cards" section at the end of most volumes. This includes a cross-referencing of English and Japanese names for cards appearing in the volume. It also mentions the first page that the card appears on and states if the card does not exist in the  Yu-Gi-Oh! Trading Card Game . This section, does however contain a few errors. 
 A scene where Jonouchi sticks his middle finger up at Keith is edited to show Jonouchi holding up his fist. 
 Profanity is lessened or removed (including sparse instances of Keith using English profanity in the original Japanese version). 
 Bunkoban 
 Main article:  Yu-Gi-Oh! (bunkoban) 
 The Japanese series has been reprinted in bunkoban format. Each volume contains more chapters, hence condensing it into 22 volumes. Each volume contains an afterword by Kazuki Takahashi, a  Yu-Gi-Oh!  character version of a Tarot card from the Major Arcana and an explanation of the included Tarot cards.
 Some dialogue is cleaned up and made less contradictory. Some scenes are edited, including changing early Egyptian flashbacks to visually match the later Pharaoh's Memory arc and altering  Zorc Necrophades ' dragon head to wrap around his body instead of point out suggestively.
 
 3-in-1 edition 
 Main article:  Yu-Gi-Oh! (3-in-1 edition) 
 The English series has been reprinted in a trade format, with each volume collecting 3 volumes each of the original run.
