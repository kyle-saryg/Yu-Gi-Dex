 Their Whereabouts! 
 
 "An Unknown Enemy!"   is the eighteenth chapter of the  Yu-Gi-Oh! ARC-V  manga .
 This chapter was first printed in Japanese in the March 2017 issue of  V Jump , released on January 21, 2017, and in English in the January 23, 2017 issue of  Weekly Shonen Jump .
 The clash between  Yuya  and  Reiji  meets an early conclusion when  Ren  suddenly appears in front of them, revealing a shocking truth about the  Genesis Omega Dragon .
 
 Summary 
   This summary is currently incomplete. 
 Through  Reiji  appeared to removed his opponent's ability to  Pendulum Summon ,  Yuya  reveals that he can bypass this with  Overscale Pendulum  and summons " Odd-Eyes Phantasma Dragon ". Reiji manages to use " D/D/D Destiny King Zero Laplace 's" effect to keep it being destroyed once for a turn, Yuya attempting to reason with Reiji to let him prove his father's innocence and that  Genesis Omega Dragon  is controlled by another. But Reiji reveals that they are being watched by a camera sphere that Yuya just noticed as  Ren  appears.  Yuto  and  Yuri  informing Yuya of the figure's identity. Explaining the G.O.D. card is possessed by his mistress  Eve , Ren explains that he has come for the  Adam Factor  which both Yuya and Reiji possess so the power can awaken the card's full potential.
 But before the confrontation escalates, the cavern begins to collapse from the strain caused by Yuya and Reiji's duel. After Ren falls back while promising to duel them and Yugo another time, Yuya and Reiji escape the collapsing cave on their Duel Monsters just as  Yuzu ,  Shingo , and  Shun  were about to check in on them. Though Yuya attempts to talk Reiji into an alliance against their common enemy, Reiji refuses and leaves with the intent to defeat the mysterious faction on his own.
 Meanwhile, coming to from a dream about his  sister ,  Sora  awakens on a hospital bed with a  doctor  inspecting him as Ren arrives and proclaims that the battle for G.O.D. has truly begun.
 
 Featured Duel: Yuya Sakaki vs. Reiji Akaba 
 Duel continues from the previous Scale . 
 Turn 7: Yuya 
Since  Yuya  has a  monster  in his  Pendulum Zone  and an " Odd-Eyes " monster in his  Extra Deck , he performs an  Overscale Pendulum  and  Pendulum Summons  " Odd-Eyes Phantasma Dragon " (3000/2500) from his  hand  regardless of his  Pendulum Scales . "Phantasma"  attacks  " D/D/D Destiny King Zero Laplace ", with the latter's  effect   activating , making its  ATK  double the ATK of "Phantasma" ("Zero Laplace": 0 → 6000 ATK). However, the effect of "Phantasma" activates as well, reducing the ATK of "Zero Laplace" by 1000 for each  Pendulum Monster  in Yuya's Extra Deck upon its attack; " Odd-Eyes Persona Dragon ", " Odd-Eyes Phantom Dragon " and three copies of " Performapal Card Gardna " are currently in Yuya's Extra Deck, so the ATK of "Zero Laplace" is decreased by 5000 ("Zero Laplace": 6000 → 1000 ATK). The attack continues, but  Reiji  activates the other effect of "Zero Laplace", preventing its own  destruction  as well as reducing the  battle damage  to Reiji to zero.
 Turn 8: Reiji 
Reiji plays  a new card  on his  Duel Disk , which reveals  Eve 's camera-like device.  Ren  then shows up, interrupting the  Duel , which ends with no result.
