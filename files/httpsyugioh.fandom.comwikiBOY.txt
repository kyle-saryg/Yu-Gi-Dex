 Lyrics (TV Size) 
 Japanese Rōmaji English 
 
 消えない記憶と　消えてしまった記録は 
あの時の風景を　そっと”NOW LOADING…”する 
置き去りの記憶　消し去った記録 
PASSWORDは一体何だっけな？ 
ACCESS記録　蘇る記憶 
「君の中の君」に挑め 
君というNetwork　その先に広がるWorld 
ここは「今」の連続だ 
君はどうだ？　「今を生きろ。」 
空に　Shooting Star　掴みとれ　その両手で 
超えろ「今」を全力で　Yell! 
Can you make it! Make your free, Let me know. 
Make your free, Let me know.
 
 
 
 Kienai kioku to kiete-shimatta kiroku wa 
Ano toki no fuukei wo sotto "NOW LOADING…" suru 
Okizari kioku keshisatta kiroku 
PASSWORD wa ittai nandattakkena? 
ACCESS kiroku yomigaeru kioku 
"Kimi no naka no kimi" ni idome 
Kimi to ui Network sono saki ni hirogaru World 
Koko wa "ima" no renzoku da 
Kimi wa dou da? "Ima wo ikiro." 
Sora ni Shooting Star tsukamitore sono ryoute de 
Koero "ima" wo zenryoku de Yell! 
Can you make it! Make your free, Let me know. 
Make your free, Let me know.
 
 
 
 Memories that don't disappear; and memories that disappeared 
I have those scenes "NOW LOADING..." quietly 
Memories left behind; erased memories 
What was the PASSWORD again? 
ACCESS records; restored memories 
Challenge "the you inside you" 
You're a Network; the World that spreads beyond 
The continuation of the "present" 
What about you?  "Live for now" 
Grab the Shooting Star in the sky with both your hands 
Overcome "now" with all your might Yell! 
Can you make it! Make your free, Let me know. 
Make your free, Let me know.
