 This monster is a  Normal Summon Monster . [1] 
 The effect which negates the effect of a card on the field  targets  one face-up card on the field. [1] 
 The negating effect of " Alector, Sovereign of Birds " does not end during the  End Phase .  The effects of the  targeted  card remains negated during the entire turn. [2] 
 Example: The effects of  Spirit monsters , " Majestic Mech - Goryu ", and " Jain, Lightsworn Paladin " will activate during the End Phase, but they will be negated and resolve without effect. 
 The effect of " Alector, Sovereign of Birds " will only negate effects that activate on the field, or that are applied as long as the monster remains on the field.  It will not stop effects like those of " Sangan " or " Black Pendant " that  activate  when sent to the Graveyard. [3] 
 The effect of " Exiled Force "  activates  on the field, so its effect will be negated by the effect of " Alector, Sovereign of Birds " even though " Exiled Force " is no longer face-up on the field. [3] 
 If " Torapart " is used as a  Synchro Material Monster  while its effect is negated by " Alector, Sovereign of Birds " or " Forbidden Chalice " or " Skill Drain ", then the effect of " Torapart " is still applied and Trap Cards cannot be activated until the end of the  Damage Step  when the Synchro Monster attacks. [4]
