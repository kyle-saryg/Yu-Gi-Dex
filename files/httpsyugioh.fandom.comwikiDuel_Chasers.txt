 Appearances 
 Yu-Gi-Oh! 5D's 
 The Duel Chasers were first mentioned by  Tetsu Trudge 's  Security chief  after receiving the Special Pursuit Deck. According to his Chief, the Duel Chasers were formed in order to stop people from misusing their Duel Runners. [1]  They were mentioned again by Trudge when he and the other officers were in the mission to hunt down  Ghost . [2]  When  Dobocle  broke into the  WRGP  announcement party, Trudge sent the Duel Chasers after him. [3] 
 
 Yu-Gi-Oh! ARC-V 
 Past 
 The Duel Chasers were created to help control the  Commons  after they revolted when  Chojiro Tokumatsu  was arrested ten years ago. [4] 
 
 Friendship Cup 
 Officer 227  went after  Yugo  for trespassing in the  Topsiders  area of  New Domino City . [5]  The Duel was then broadcast from a helicopter to various places around New Domino City, including the homes of the Tops, with  Melissa Trail  commentating. When 227 thought he was about to finish Yugo off,  Roget  warned him not to attack, but he didn't listen and his blunder allowed Yugo to win the Duel, which defeated 227 and stopped his  Duel Runner . 227 was fired and demoted down to the Commons as a result of this loss, even being arrested by his former colleagues. Shortly thereafter, however, he received an invitation by Roget to enter the  Friendship Cup , offering to restore him to his former position if he defeated  Yuya Sakaki . However, 227 was defeated and sent to the  Underground Labor Facility .
 
 Friendship Cup Finals 
 When Roget initialized his "King's Gambit" plan, a  chip  activated in the head of his Sector Security officers and put them in a trance to follow his orders and they assaulted the  High Council  chambers. A Duel Chaser later captured Yuya and took him to the Security Headquarters after his second-round Duel. The Duel Chasers prepared to attack the Council Chambers to retake control from  Declan Akaba , but they were forced to engage the  Obelisk Force  at the Council Chambers, though it was  Sergey Volkov  who defeated the  Fusion Dimension  soldiers. The Duel Chasers later found themselves caught in a riot of the Commons, while their own imprisoned members in the  Underground Labor Facility , led by 227, broke out as well. Five Duel Chasers later began a Duel with one another and  Fusion Summoned  three " Goyo Emperors " each with the intent to attack Yuya and  Jack Atlas  during their Duel, but Jack defeated them all with ease using " Scarlight Red Dragon Archfiend ". The Duel Chasers, along with the rest of Sector Security, were freed from their mind control after  Sora Perse  and  Moon Shadow  destroyed the control center, and along with the rest of New Domino City, watched the conclusion of the Duel between Yuya and Jack.
 
 Deck 
 Duel Chasers in ARC-V use a Deck centered around " Goyo "  Synchro Monsters . Many of them later acquired " Goyo Emperor "  Fusion Monsters  from  Jean-Michel Roget .
