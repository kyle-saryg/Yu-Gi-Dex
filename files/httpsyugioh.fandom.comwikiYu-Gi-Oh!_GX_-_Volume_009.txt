 This section, or a part of it, has been transcluded from  Yu-Gi-Oh! GX - Volume 001 ; any changes involving it should be made  there  instead.  /  
 Years after Yugi's legendary battles, the game is so popular that special institutions dedicated to the art of the Duel have sprung up all over the world. Join Jaden Yuki and his pals at the Academy for the adventures of the next generation of "Yu-Gi-Oh!" [1] 
 Battle to the Finish… 
 The possessed Principal Mackenzie makes his final bid to crush the students of Duel Academy and seize Chazz and Jaden's Spirit Cards! Jaden will need all his dueling skill as he battles his way through to the final Duel, fighting for his friends, his mentor Koyo Hibiki, and the fate of Duel Academy itself! [2] 
 
 The Story So Far 
 On an island in the southern sea stands an academy where the next generation of duelists is trained. It is called Duel Academy! 
 Jaden Yuki learned about the excitement of dueling through an encounter with the World Dueling Champion, Koyo Hibiki. Entrusted with Hibiki's deck, Jaden takes on all challengers at the Academy in order to become a true duelist! 
 Having learned of the black shadow that's after the spirit cards, Jaden resolved to new fight with a new deck of his own! In the midst of this, several American duelists arrived for an exchange battle. The tag duels end and the action shifts to one-on-one duels! Jaden defeats Adrian Gecko, and the other members head into their separate duels. However, in the background, a dark shadow is closing in on them! [2]

 Message from Kazuki Takahashi 
 As Yu-Gi-Oh! kept evolving, Mr. Kageyama Drew  "GX"  very carefully, with love. I think Jaden's pleased, too. You've worked very hard for a long time, Mr. Kageyama. Well done I'm looking forward to your next manga. [2] 
 
 Message from Naoyuki Kageyama 
 In March of 2011,  "Yu-Gi-Oh! GX"  ended, the  "Yu-Gi-Oh! 5D's"  TV anime ended, and right in the middle of all that, we had the Tohoku earthquake and tsunami. I won't be forgetting 2011 any time soon. [2]
