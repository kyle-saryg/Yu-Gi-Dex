Limitation Text  is an unofficial term for the text sometimes displayed in the bottom-left corner of a card instead of a  passcode , and details special limitations for when that card may be used.
 There are currently four types of limitation text used in the  TCG  and two types in the  OCG .
 
 Contents 
 
 1   This card cannot be used in a Duel. 
 2   This card cannot be in a Deck. 
 3   Not usable in Official Duels. 
 4   Not an Official Yu-Gi-Oh! TCG Card. 
 
 
 This card cannot be used in a Duel. 
 This limitation text states that the card is  illegal  in any official Duel. This is the most common type of limitation text. However, some cards with this text are specifically allowed at  Yu-Gi-Oh! Day  events in Japan.
 The following cards use this text:
 
 The original (non-Effect)  Egyptian God  cards 
 All  Match winners , except " Victory Dragon " (which is  Forbidden ) 
 The  Second National Tournament prize cards 
 " Set Sail for The Kingdom ", " Duelist Kingdom ", and " Glory of the King's Hand " 
 " Creator of Hope ", " Winning Formula ", and " Creator of Miracles " 
 " Card of Last Will " 
 Several  Giant Cards  and  Case Toppers  also use this text to state that only that particular copy cannot be used in a Duel, due to its nonstandard size.
