 Story 
 Arclight Brothers Maneuver 
 Assembling Data 
       The  Seven Barian Emperors  arriving on the Human World.     
 Nash  and the other Barian Emperors appear before Yuma and the others, revealing his true allegiance. As Yuma denies this, his  key  and Nash's  emblem  suddenly react to each other, causing them to see each other's memories. With Yuma falling unconscious as a result, he and the others are able to escape thanks to the arrival of  Roku ,  Kaze  and other  duelists  that Yuma have encountered in the past, who decide to duel against the emperors, along with Bronk, who stays behind to face  Marin  and  Quattro , who faces Nash.  Vector , however, decides to watch the duels from a rooftop, in order to gauge Nash's power. Meanwile, Marin summons her  Number 10X ,  Number 103: Ragnazero . Quattro summons his Giant Grinder, but Nash summons his new "Number" card,  Number 101: Silent Honor ARK , using its effect to turn Giant Grinder into one of its overlay units. Quattro manages to reclaim Giant Grinder and uses  Rank-Up-Magic Argent Chaos Force , a card made by his family, to evolve him into Number C15: Gimmick Puppet Giant Hunter, and destroy ARK. However, Nash, along with the other Emperors, use their power to perform a  Barian's Chaos Draw , which shocks Vector. 
 
         Nash vows to bury his last link to "Reginald" by defeating Quattro.     
 The six emperors draw " Rank-Up-Magic - The Seventh One ", which allows them to evolve their  Number 10X  into  Chaos Numbers , with Nash using his to evolve "ARK" into " Number C101: Silent Honor DARK ". Quattro manages to survive Nash's attack and uses "Argent Chaos Force" to evolve his "Gimmick Puppet of Strings" into " Number C40: Gimmick Puppet of Dark Strings " and destroys "Silent Honor DARK" in an attempt to reach Shark's feelings. However, Nash uses the effect of "Silent Honor DARK" to bring it back and restore his own life points. He then enrages Quattro by showing him footage of his allies as they are defeated by the Barian Emperors one by one and sent to  Barian World . Quattro comes to loses all hope that he could save Nash and Nash claimed he could bury the last link to "Reginald" by defeating Quattro, but was pleased that Quattro's hatred had been reignited as his voice adopted a more demonic tone.
 
         Quattro being sent to  Barian World .     
As the  Duel  continues, Quattro proceeded to Rank-Up " Number 88: Gimmick Puppet of Leo " into " Number C88: Gimmick Puppet Disaster Leo ", but Nash countered its  Automatic Win  condition by attaching an Overlay Unit from "Silent Honor DARK" to it via " Overlay Award ". Using " Cross Draw of Destiny ", Nash Summoned " Silent Wobby " to Quattro's field and absorbed it with "Silent Honor DARK", defeating Quattro with a boost from " Power Stream ". As Quattro was sent to the Barian World, he remarked he'd be going to hell before Nash, who responded that he'd be joining Quattro there as soon as the conflict was over. The other Emperors regrouped and Nash ordered them to split and find the remaining "Number" holders - Yuma, Astral, Kite,  Trey  and  Quinton . Meanwhile, Yuma regains consciousness and learns what happened to his friends.         Trey and Quinton prepare to face off against  Mizar .      As Yuma tries to think of a way to stop the Barians without fighting his friend (Nash),  Kite  states that "Shark" was now their enemy and they could not avoid a fight now. Yuma insisted they couldn't fight their friend, but Kite pointed out that Quattro was dead because of him and he was their friend too. Astral suggests that they may be able to return them to normal if they defeat  Don Thousand . However, Kite told them he couldn't go and that he had something to do departing on Orbital's motorcycle form, while Trey and Quinton become determined to avenge Quattro. With Yuma and Astral preparing to head off to Barian World alone, Cathy encourages Tori to go with them, while Trey and Quinton prepare to face off against  Mizar .
 Tachyon Dragon Imprisoned 
         Don Thousand  appears before  Alito  and  Girag .     
 As Mizar takes on both Trey and Quinton at once,  Vector  uses the separation of the Barian Emperors to put  Alito  and  Girag  under Don Thousand's control, as part of his plan to usurp Nash, even when Alito calls Vector a fool for reviving Don Thousand. Meanwhile,  Caswell  and  Cathy  tell Yuma's family where he has gone. Meanwhile back with Quinton, he informed Mizar that he was the one who had taught  Kite  how to Duel, which seemed to intrigue Mizar. The Duel began and Quinton immediately brings out "Number 9: Dyson Sphere". The immense monster's presence warning  Dumon  and  Marin  to the Duel's start and they quickly joined Mizar, who told them he was fine and to go search for Yuma and Kite. Quinton and Trey used the power of their bracelets'  crests  to generate a  Sphere Field , trapping the three  Barians . Mizar summons "Number 107: Galaxy-Eyes Tachyon Dragon" and destroys "Dyson Sphere". In their respective whereabouts, Kite and Yuma dwell on Trey and Quinton's situation. Meanwhile, Girag alerts Nash to Yuma's exodus in order to trick him, and Nash promptly returns to Barian World to pursue him. Back to the Duel, Trey summons "Atlandis" and attempts to use "Dyson Sphere" to gain its ATK, but Mizar uses a trap to negate this effect. But the brothers have planned for this, and use " Rank-Up-Magic Argent Chaos Force ", ranking "Atlandis" up to "Chaos Number 6: Chronomaly Chaos Atlandis" and attacking "Tachyon Dragon". Mizar's trap is destroyed to preserve "Tachyon Dragon", allowing Trey to equip "Tachyon Dragon" to "Chaos Atlandis". Mizar called this the first time he had been humiliated and used  Barian's Chaos Draw  to draw " The Seventh One ". He intended to  Rank-Up  "Tachyon Dragon", but quickly realized he could not, as it was not on his field or in his Graveyard or Extra Deck, but equipped to his opponent's monster.
 
         " Neo Galaxy-Eyes Tachyon Dragon " activates its effect, " Time Tyrant ".     
Admitting he had underestimated them, Mizar played defensively using " Heliosphere Dragon " and two  Trap Cards . This was enough to survive Quinton's combo of "Chaos Atlandis" and " Number C9: Chaos Dyson Sphere ", though his Life Points remained at only 1. Mizar also recovered "Tachyon Dragon" this way, enabling him to summon "Neo Tachyon". The brothers attempted a counter with " Monopole Chain " and " Atlandis Invitation ", but the effect of "Neo Tachyon" rewound time and rendered them useless.          Girag  captures  Nash .     Meanwhile,  Girag  captures Nash during their travel and brings him to Don Thousand, saying that he couldn't allow Nash to duel Yuma, "in the name of Don Thousand." Before their defeat, Quinton activated a communications link with Yuma and told both him and Mizar where Kite had gone. He had discovered  tablet detailing a legend  regarding the " Galaxy-Eyes " dragons. Believing them connected to the  Numeron Code , he journeyed to the moon. Quinton told Yuma to remember the end of this Duel as a warning at how powerful the  Seven Barian Emperors  could be. As Yuma sobs, Mizar defeats them.          Orbital 7  status of  Quinton  and  Trey .     As they were defeated, they told Yuma they'd always be with him in spirit. The Sphere Field encasing the Duel's area fades as the souls of Quinton and Trey stream towards the Barian World as Mizar say "farewell, proud brothers." Vector vanishes through a portal, grinning. Kite's " Photon Dragon " card glows as he nears the moon. Mizar sees his own " Tachyon Dragon " card is also glowing. Dumon asks if Mizar plans to go to the moon, with Mizar responding that his greatest enemy waits there.
 The Sundered Seven Emperors 
 Alito's Revival 
         Tori  trapped in the vines.     
Yuma has fallen to his knees after witnessing defeat of Quinton and Trey, sobbing. Tori tries to comfort him, but Astral tells him he must lift his head high - everyone has placed their trust in him. He says he knows as the  airship  continues on its way.  Alito  in a red light streams towards the Different Dimension Airship, passing over the deck before circling back. " Number C105: Battlin' Boxer Comet Cestus " materializes and punches the front of the airship, knocking Yuma and Tori overboard, with Astral following. Sometime later, they regain consciousness and find themselves in the between dimensions somewhere. Alito then materializes challenging Yuma to a Duel to settle their score, but the latter refused to fight him and compared Alito to  Nistro  as they were both hot-blooded Duelists who shouldered the hopes of children. When Astral mentioned his ruins, Altio remember his days a gladiator and was idolized by children. However, Don Thousand told him not to listen to the duo and reminded him that his past ended in tragedy. Alito then turned into his  Barian  form and trapped Tori in thorny vines to forced Yuma to Duel him. As Alito uses "The Seventh One" to bring out  Chaos Number , Astral notices he is being possessed by Don Thousand.          Don Thousand  finally emerges.     Don Thousand reveals his presence to Yuma and Astral, and reveals that by extracting the 7  Mythyrian Numbers  from the  Number ruins , they released the seal placed on him. He also reveals to them that he reincarnated the 7 humans depicted in the ruins of the Legendary Numbers as the Seven Barian Emperors, because their souls were connected to their corresponding Legendary Numbers. Despite taking a lot of damage from Alito's attack, Yuma senses that his passionate dueling still resides within him. Wanting to bring Alito back to his old self, Yuma summons " Heroic Champion - Excalibur ", but his attack is stopped by Alito, who then summons " Number 80: Rhapsody in Berserk ", which he equips to Comet Cestus. 
 Yuma brings out " Number 54: Lion Heart ", which reawakens Alito's memories of his past life, in which he was allegedly betrayed by his best friend and sentenced to death. Yuma then uses Lion Heart's power to have Alito discard  Rhapsody in Berserk , dispelling Don Thousand's hold on him. Although no longer under control and freeing Tori, Alito demands that they see their duel through to the end as he still holds hatred over his past. Alito brings back "Rhapsody in Beserk" and uses "Barian's Force" to evolve it into " Number C80: Requiem in Berserk " and equip it to "Comet Cestus" to negate Lion Heart's effect, but Yuma manages to survive thanks to his trap card. Feeling Alito may be under a different curse altogether, Astral encourages Yuma to destroy Comet Cestus with Lion Heart and win the duel. This in turn shows Alito the true nature of his memories, in which Don Thousand had taken control of Alito's friend, causing him to turn against Alito so he could be revived as a Barian Emperor. Having learned the truth, Alito decides to join Yuma in help defeating Don Thousand.
 
 Vector's Scorn 
         Nash tangled in dark tentacles.     
 Within an inflamed Sphere Field, Nash is tangled in dark tentacles, being confined by  Don Thousand . A screen appeared before him, and he witnessed as his sister and Dumon are confronted by Vector when they arrived. Vector informed them he intended to unite the power of the Seven Emperors. Dumon responded that the seven were already united, but Vector corrected him, saying he would absorb their powers for himself. He revealed that he had released Don Thousand, who tells them that the Seven Emperors were simply his pawns to ensure the restoration of his power. 
 
         The  Battle Royal  of the three Emperors.     
Dumon pointed out that applied to Vector too, but Vector claimed that with Thousand's power, he was a god himself. Dumon suggested Marin flee to inform the others, but Vector clarified that Alito and Girag were working for him, yet adding that Alito had sided with Yuma now. Vector then challenged the two emperors, who have no other options, in a  Battle Royal  style. As Duel begins, Marin and Dumon combined " Number 103: Ragnazero " and " Number 102: Star Seraph Sentry " to destroy Vector's " Number 96: Dark Mist ".          Vector's previous attempt to kill Nash and Marin.     
 However, Vector Summoned " Number 43: Manipulator of Souls " and equipped "Dark Mist" to it before recovering his Life Points using the Continuous Spell " Don Thousand's Throne ", which drew its power from  Nash , who is held captive within a  Sphere Field , which in turn increased the monster's ATK and deals damage to Marin. Vector revealed his "point" system and the fact that he attempted to kill Nash and Marin previously. They also learned of the  soul transfer . Marin, enraged by Vector's words, uses "The Seventh One" to bring out " Number C103: Ragnafinity ". Even though they were able to use their combo, with Dumon evolving his Number up with Rank-Up-Magic - The Seventh One, Vector managed to survive, and used Damage Pot to inflict damage to defeat both Emperors in a vicious assault. 
 
         Vector absorbing the souls of Alito, Girag, and Ponta shortly after absorbing Dumon and Marin's.     
 Dumon activated  Sacred Shield  to negate the damage and boosted Ragnafinity's attack power, but it also resulted in his death due to the card's side effect. However, even with his sacrifice, Marin was defeated leaving both of their souls to be absorbed by Vector. Meanwhile, Yuma's group is stopped in their tracks by  Girag . Alito dueled Girag, and while he lost in the end, he managed to break Girag of Thousand's influence. Later, Vector attempted to murder Yuma and Girag, but Girag pushed Yuma out of the way and took the hit for him. As a result, Girag's, Alito's and Ponta's souls were absorbed into Vector. Vector was about to face off against Yuma, but he sensed Nash escaping from the prison he incarcerated him in and returned to the Barian World to Duel him.
 
 Galaxy Dragon Showdown 
         The battle of  Legend of the Dragons of Light and Time .     
 On the moon,  Mizar  challenged  Kite  to one final showdown to decide who obtains the  key  to the  Numeron Code  and the right of becoming the true " Galaxy-Eyes " master. Even though Kite won, he conceded the title to Mizar. He was then entrusted with the key and told to follow his own path, as Kite died from his sustained injuries and oxygen deprivation. [1] 
 
 Nash vs. Vector 
   Vector  vs.  Nash .   Vector's new form.   Vector's " Number C " army.   Vector's memory is triggered.   " Number C5: Chaos Chimera Dragon " is Summoned.   " Number C73: Abyss Supra Splash " is Summoned.....   and defeats "Chaos Chimera Dragon". 1/7 
 In the Barian World, Vector summoned the arena of his Number Ruins to utilize as a battleground for his rematch against Nash, who raced through the Barian World and confronted the duplicitous Barian Emperor. The two began their Duel, and eventually Yuma, Astral, and Tori arrived and observed the match. Vector summoned the souls of Girag, Dumon, Alito and Marin and fully absorbed their powers, giving himself a tremendous boost in strength. After Nash managed to usurp control of " Number C65: King Overfiend " from Vector and boost its ATK to 3200, he used it to destroy Vector's " Number C104: Umbral Horror Masquerade ". Due to Vector's "Mythyrian Number" destroying his " Number 10X " 
 Vector's original memories were revealed; he was a benevolent prince, but was corrupted by Don Thousand. Yuma and Tori encouraged Vector to realize that his real self was kind just like "Ray Shadows". Vector feigned repentance and gave Nash an opportunity to defeat him. Nash relented and attacked, but Vector attempted to have Nash defeated although he failed and revealed his actions were a deception and that he was aware that Don Thousand had altered his memories. Having enough of Don Thousand calling him a "pesky God" he used his newly obtained powers to incinerate Don Thousand, seemingly obliterating him. Vector then Summoned " Number C5: Chaos Chimera Dragon " which he can Summon after absorbing the souls of his fellow Emperors and almost defeated Nash with it, but he Summoned " Number C73: Abyss Supra Splash " and defeated Vector.  [2] 
 
 The Final Interdimensional Battles 
 Don Thousand Emerges 
         Don Thousand emerges after Vector's defeat.     
 Even after being defeated in the rematch, Vector tried using his remaining power to destroy everything. However, his plan was interrupted by Don Thousand, who revealed himself to be still alive. Thousand revealed he was released from Vector now and the powers Vector believed to be his, are from Thousand himself and began to absorb Vector. 
 Vector tried to resist but was rescued by Yuma, who grabbed his hand. Astral, Tori and even Nash warned Yuma to stop, with the latter adding that Vector will just betray Yuma again, but Yuma decided to trust Vector. Vector feigned his Ray Shadows persona again and attempted to drag Yuma with him, but Yuma did not relent and believed Vector can return to his "Ray Shadows" persona. Realizing Yuma trusted him, Vector sacrificed himself to protect Yuma and was absorbed by Thousand. [3] 
 Mizar arrived and gave Yuma " Number 100: Numeron Dragon " while telling Nash that the Barian Emperors were created by Don Thousand to fulfill his agenda of being revived and decided to confront the Barian deity, who manifested his true form. Mizar attempted a  One Turn Kill  on Thousand, but Mizar was quickly defeated by his own card and his soul was devoured by Thousand. 
 
         Don Thousand  vs.  Yuma  and  Nash .     
 After defeating Mizar, Thousand revealed his true machination: Since he could not discover where the Numeron Code was, except that it was on the Earth, he fused the Barian World and Earth together to obtain dominion over the Numeron Code. Thousand challenged Yuma and Nash to a Duel, with the Numeron Code allowing Thousand to open a portal to the Astral World and directly attack it when Yuma and Nash took damage. During the Duel, it was revealed that Thousand had activated "Numeron Network" as a Field Spell Card to "modify" Mizar's cards in the previous Duel, and demonstrated this power again by effortlessly countering the Summon of "Number 39: Utopia". [3] 
 
         Don Thousand 's  attacks  damage the  Astral World .     
 Don Thousand Summoned four "Numbers", " Number 1: Numeron Gate Ekam , " Number 2: Numeron Gate Dve ", " Number 3: Numeron Gate Trini " and " Number 4: Numeron Gate Catvari " which, powered by "Numeron Network", almost defeated the duo with a  One Turn Kill . When this failed, Thousand Summoned " Number C1: Numeron Chaos Gate Sunya " in another attempt to inflict 50,000 damage. However Astral located where the true form of Numeron Network resided and began to materialize it on the battlefield for Nash to destroy, but at the expense of Astral's life, as the energy of the Numeron Code would implode on him, however  Eliphas  took Astral's place and gave him a card before perishing. After Nash was able to destroy "Numeron Network", Thousand Summoned " Number C1000: Numeronius ", which deprived the triumvirate of their most powerful monsters.
 
         The first fifty " Numbers " mark the location of the  Numeron Code .     
 Thousand also revealed that due to the recoil of his engagement against the Original Number, Astral's power was split and became fifty of the "Numbers". Those cards scattered across the  Earth , designating the location of the  Numeron Code . After that, seven of those "Numbers" suppressed Thousand's power and chose their owners, attaching themselves to various heroes and sages of Earth (shots of  Alito ,  Vector , and  Girag  with their respective  "Mythyrian Numbers"  are shown over this).
 
         Kite's spirit stands with Yuma and Nash.     
 However the arrival of Kite's spirit allowed them to summon " Number 100: Numeron Dragon ", which they used to defeat "Numeronius". Finally, Thousand Summoned " Number iC1000: Numeronius Numeronia " which almost guaranteed his victory, but a combination of  Number 39: Utopia   powered by the effects of " Number 73: Abyss Splash " and "Numeron Dragon", allowed the monster to acquire 204,000 ATK points to vanquish Thousand. 
 
 Barian's Top Guardian vs. ZEXAL Wielders 
         Remants of  Don Thousand 's power and his " Numbers " are absorbed by Nash.     
 Before dying, Don Thousand asserted that his true curse had not been dispelled while transferring his remaining power and "Numbers" to Nash who challenged Yuma to a final rematch for the Numeron Code. [4] 
 
         The arena between the  Barian  and  Astral Worlds .     
 When they were resuscitated, they find themselves in a small room surrounded by pillars, while  Baria  and  Astralite  crystals floated around. Before them is a winding staircase, which leads straight into the Astral World, the  Astral Tower  visible. Yuma says it cannot be. Turning, Yuma observes another staircase leading to Earth - which is still fused with the Barian World. Yuma questions what is going on - they should have protected the world by defeating Thousand. Nash appears behind them in human form, saying that Earth and the Barian World are still merged - and they are currently in a small location between that merged world and the Astral World. Yuma mutters "Shark..." Nash explains that right now, the two worlds are pulling against one another. If it keeps up, the two worlds will collide, resulting in the Astral World's destruction. 
 Yuma says he does not understand - they defeated Don Thousand. Astral turns to Nash and says "it cannot be because you...". Nash confirms Astral's thoughts - this is the result of him absorbing Don Thousand's power. Yuma questions why he would do that and Tori inquires if Don Thousand's was not his enemy too. Nash reminds them that he is a  Barian  warrior - making him their enemy, regardless of Thousand's corruption. Nash comments that the Astral World was created by the souls throughout the universe that desired to  Rank-Up . By attempting to do so, they banished everything they perceived as "evil", which included Chaos, resulting in the creation of the Barian World.
 
         The three suns.     
 Nash compares his world to the Astral World's table scraps, but asserts he cannot abandon it. His comrades are in the Barian World - friends who can never be replaced. Yuma begins to argue, but Nash claims it does not matter - Astral's mission is to use the  Numeron Code  to extinguish the Barian World. Yuma says there must be a way to let both worlds coexist. Nash says that is impossible. Astral agrees, revealing that the Astral World has become so debilitated that if the worlds became one, it would simply vanish. Nash muses that they can travel down one path or the other - only one world will survive. Yuma questions if they really fought all this time for it to end like this. Nash claims it is their fate. Yuma refuses to believe it - he knows that everyone can learn to understand one another. 
 Yuma recalls that Don Thousand's spell has not been broken yet. Nash says that it can never be broken. Looking up at the three suns that now occupy a space in the sky, he explains that though Thousand interfered with the lives of the other  Barian Emperors  and altered their memories, he did nothing to Nash. He reveals that he became a Barian of his own volition, because of the people he was close to already having been taken to that world upon death. Yuma is in disbelief. 
 Nash says that he still considers Yuma and Astral friends, but if they stand in his path, he will take them down - he cannot abandon the other Barians. He claims that Thousand's true curse is Nash's very existence. Yuma stutters, but Nash continues, saying that when he decided to become a Barian again, Reginald "Shark" Kastle died. He demands they settle things once and all, angrily yelling both Yuma and Astral's names. Yuma mutters "Shark...", but Astral says they should do it - they have always found their answers in Duels. Yuma agrees and sets his  D-Pad , while Nash  Barian Battlemorphs  and Yuma dons his  D-Gazer . They all yell "Duel!".
 
         Yuma and  Astral  discuss the  Numeron Code .     
 Yuma questions Astral if they will really find an answer in this Duel - is there a future they can discover that will rescue everybody? Tori mutters the names of both Yuma and Astral. Astral tells him there may be a way to solve all their problems - the Numeron Code. He reminds Yuma that the winner of this Duel will become its owner - and it can rewrite the past and future. Yuma asks if he is serious. Astral says he is - everything that has occurred could be restored. Yuma muses that they may be able to use the Code's power to revive everyone who was killed. He questions Astral if that is a real future though. 
 What kind of future would result from their running away from all the times they had together - the moments that they fought tooth-and-nail against their foes and grew closer to one another? Yuma says they fought to grasp their own future. Astral agrees with him - there wouldn't be any value in a future not won. Astral reveals that before he would have used the Code without any hesitation, but he's not so sure now - that is why they must Duel. Astral says this Duel will be his own " kattobingu ". Yuma agrees - they will be able to find a solution through this Duel. Yuma tells Astral to "kattobingu", while Yuma figures things out. 
 
   " CXyz Barian Hope " is Summoned....   and unites Nash with the other Emperors. 1/2 
 Nash summoned the seven "Chaos Over-Hundred Numbers" to create his ultimate ace card, " CXyz Barian Hope ". This monster wielded the power of all seven of the "Chaos Over-Hundred Numbers" and allowed Nash to use each of their effects once per turn by either detaching an Overlay Unit or paying 400 Life Points. Nash continually paid his Life Points, as he did not wish to sacrifice his comrades again, as their souls were bound to the Overlay Units. Though Nash used the effect of all the "Chaos Over-Hundred Numbers" except his own, Yuma and Astral narrowly avoided defeat. Yuma and Astral performed ZEXAL Morph, but at that point, the worlds began to drift closer to one another. They were rescued by  Kazuma Tsukumo  and  Vetrix , who used their powers to erect barriers between the arena and the colliding worlds. They urged the combatants to continue the Duel.
 
   The other forms of " Number 39: Utopia " appear to merge....   to create " Number 39: Utopia Beyond ". 1/2 
         "Barian Hope" trades blows with " Number 39: Utopia Beyond ".     
 Yuma activated " Rank-Up-Magic Astral Force " to create " Number 39: Utopia Beyond ". "Barian Hope" would have been destroyed, but Nash countered with " Overlay Menace " to protect the other Emperors and " Xyz Trip " to negate the attack. Nash attempted a counterattack, but Yuma's activation of " Weaker Overlay " and " Damage Reactor " allowed "Utopia Beyond" to destroy "Barian Hope". 
 Nash set up the return of "Barian Hope" with " Reincarnation of the Seven Emperors " before Summoning " Black Ray Lancer " in an attempt to defeat Yuma. Yuma countered with the effect of "Utopia Beyond", Summoning "Utopia" again. Yuma says that "Utopia" and "Black Ray Lancer" are on the  field  now. He adds that he remembers a Duel like this that they had a long time ago (scenes from their Duels in episodes  10  and  84  are shown here). Yuma says that though they clashed again and again, they always talked during the Duels too. Nash claims Yuma was just a pest back then, someone who meddled in things that didn't concern him and bluntly shoved his way into people's hearts. Yuma tells Nash that even now, they are still friends. He asks if they cannot go back to the way things were. Nash responds that it's impossible - neither of them are the same as they used to be. 
 Yuma questions if he really believes they can no longer understand each other. Nash says Yuma doesn't get it - they already understand each other. Nash explains that he's known how Yuma feels for a long time and how he felt when they fought. Yuma mutters "Shark...", but Nash continues that even friends that understand each other may stop being friends. Nash adds that there are people who believe in him and that are still fighting by his side. The spirits of the other  Barian Emperors ,  Iris  and the soldiers of the  United Lands of the Poseidon Ocean  appear around him as he vows that he cannot betray them by losing. Yuma mutters "lose..." and thinks back to  the Door  telling him that he could obtain a new power - but the price would be losing that which is most important to him. Astral turns to Yuma and Yuma thinks about what it is he would lose. Nash tells Yuma to come at him and Yuma wonders if what he'll lose will be Shark or Astral. He determines it must be neither - as he would never allow himself to lose either of his best friends.
 
         "Barian Hope" and "Utopia" stop their  battle .     
 Nash weakened "Utopia" with " Friller Rabca " and brought out " Submersible Carrier Aero Shark " as well, but Yuma survived with " Damage Take-Over ". Using ZEXAL, Yuma and Astral created " ZW - Sylphid Wing ", but Nash revived "Barian Hope" using " Rebirth of the Seven Emperors " at the expense of his Rank 3 monsters. Yuma pushed the attack, but Nash used " Draw of Fate " to negate the attack and force both players to draw a card. If the player did not use the drawn card by the end of this turn, they would  automatically lose . Nash used Barian's Chaos Draw to draw " Glory of the Seven Emperors ", while Yuma used Shining Draw to draw "Double or Nothing!" Yuma canceled his attack after activating "Double or Nothing!", knowing that defeating Nash would be to sacrifice Yuma's rapport for his enemies, just as  the Door  had predicted. 
 
         Nash surrenders the "Numbers" to Astral.     
 Nash had known he would play "Double or Nothing!", but this action was not predicted. "Glory of the Seven Emperors" would have allowed him defeat Yuma had Yuma done anything else, but canceling his attack resulted in Nash's Life Points becoming 0. Nash encouraged Yuma never to abandon what is most important to him - his ability to believe in others and his pure heart. He mused that he would not witness the future they would create though. The "Numbers" flooded from Nash's body and were absorbed by Astral. Nash told Tori to never let Yuma out of her sight and called Yuma and Astral the best friends he'd ever had. He informed them that he considered this final Duel to be his greatest - and also the most enjoyable. Nash succumbed to his wounds after this, fading away. [5] 
 
 Ceremonial Battle: The Emissary of Astral vs. The Zero-to-Hero of Earth 
         The  Numeron Code  appears.     
 With the final Duels against  Don Thousand  and  Nash  ending in their defeats, the countless souls trapped in the  Barian World  were released and rain down on the  Earth . As a result,  Yuma  is able to reunite with all his friends, who had risked their lives to safeguard the future of the planet. However, with all the " Numbers " now in  Astral 's possession, the  Numeron Code  finally appears, changing everything. Astral claims he must use it to annihilate the Barian World. Yuma asks if he is serious and Astral tells him that the Barian World is the root of all  Chaos  - it cannot be left as it is. Yuma inquires if the Astral World has changed yet.
 
         The Final Duel.     
 He says there is no point to the future if they have to keep sacrificing things. He wonders if Astral learned anything from all this - if they keep fighting, they can figure out a better approach. Yuma wonders if Astral would really give up this easily. Astral replies that his answer will not change. Yuma asserts he will never let Astral do something like that. Astral asks what Yuma plans to do, then. He replies that he will Duel him. Astral wonders if he means to wager the future that the Code will create on the Duel. 
 Yuma confirms this, but Astral reminds him that he possesses each and every last "Number". He claims no one in the universe can defeat him now. He wonders how Yuma can still intend to fight. Yuma demands that if he wins, he will listen to Yuma. Astral agrees, but tells him that if he wins, he'll destroy the Barian World and delete every last memory of Astral from Yuma's mind. Yuma still agrees, so Astral tells him they will Duel tonight at the station square. Thus, they were both given time to prepare for the duel. Once preparations were complete, they meet at Station Square and the final Duel commenced.
 
         The five forms of "Utopia" gather.     
 As the Duel started, Astral Summoned "Utopia", along with its upgraded forms: "Number C39: Utopia Ray", "Number C39: Utopia Ray V", "Number C39: Utopia Ray Victory" and "Number 39: Utopia Beyond". After a direct attack from "Utopia Ray V", Yuma was discouraged, but Astral encouraged him to continue. Yuma did so in one turn, summoning "Gagaga Cowboy" and "Gagaga Samurai" in with a few support cards to destroy Utopia's 4 evolved forms, and almost OTK Astral, had it not been for Heat & Heal. Astral deduces from Yuma's previous comment on the 5 utopia monsters being more impressive then he expected that his partner predicted beforehand that he would be facing all 5 of them at once, and developed a way to beat them, and continued his onslaught with the original Utopia. 
 Yuma attacked the Number with Gagaga Cowboy, causing Astral out of precaution to negate the attack, only to find out it was a risky but successful bluff from Yuma to use Moon Bumper, with the astral being proceeding to complimenting his partner on his play and the way he evolved as a duelist. Yuma tries to reason with Astral, telling him to remember that his duel with Eliphas delivered the Astral World from the forced destiny of existing solely to rank-up, only to Astral to reveal that he has never forgotten all their moments together, which he cherished, but then abruptly declaring he will fulfill the pact he and Yuma signed together, using Rank-Down-Magic Hope Fall to summon Number 39: Utopia Roots, before proceeding on with his relentless attack on Yuma using Overlay Accel to attach Kite and Shark's Numbers to Number 39 as materials to allow him to attack multiple times, thinking to himself he won't forget all those who fought at his side. At this point the duel is at a standstill.
 
         " Number F0: Utopic Future " is Summoned.     
 Yuma admitted to Astral that he truly enjoyed Dueling, as it allowed him make new friends. He questioned Astral on what he will do after he collected the "Numbers". Astral replied that he will complete his mission and return to the Astral World. Yuma then questioned what Astral will do after that. He replied that he did not know. Yuma said that he knew his future is bright, but if he did get the chance to show it to Astral, he may not be there. He managed to make a comeback by using "Master Piece"  performs a Shining Draw on his own to use his fallen Xyz Monsters to Special Summon " Number F0: Utopic Future ", declaring he found a path for his own future, as Astral deduces for sure that Yuma is in fact a part of himself he lost during his ancient Fight with Don Thousand. Yuma activated its effect to usurp control of Astral's Number 39: Utopia Roots" and attack him with it. 
 
         " Number 99: Utopic Dragon " emerges.     
 Astral then used "Hyper-Rank-Up-Magic Ultimate Force" to use "Utopia Roots" to Xyz Summon "Number 99: Utopic Dragon". Yuma tried to take control of Astral's new monster with "Utopic Future", but Astral used its effect to negate that effect and destroy all other monsters. Yuma protected "Utopia Roots" with its own effect; however, he would take damage equal to the ATK of the "Utopia Beyond" that was destroyed. 
 He saved himself with the second effect of "Utopic Future" by reducing the damage to 0. On the next turn, Yuma tried to take control of "Utopic Dragon" again by attacking it, but Astral negated the effect of "Utopic Future" once more and Yuma prevented his monster's destruction. Yuma activated "Kattobingu Challenge" to let "Utopic Future" attack again, as well as "Braving Memory" to increase its ATK to 4000 500 for each Number card in Astral's graveyard, and protecting it from being destroyed by battle. This allowed it to destroy "Utopic Dragon". 
 
         "Utopic Future"  destroys  " The Door of Destiny ".     
 "Braving Memory" also granted "Utopic Future" another attack, but Astral used "The Door of Destiny" to negate the attack, while also reminding Yuma that he will be defeated if he does not destroy it. Yuma reminded Astral that this was where they first met; he also realized that the most important thing he would lose was Astral. He hesitated, but Astral said that he had a card to help him win. Yuma realized what his friend meant, finished the Duel by activating "Double or Nothing!" to continue his attack and defeat Astral.
 With his defeat, Astral reconsidered his mission, and after the two friends share a heartwarming goodbye, he used the Code for different purposes: The Seven Barian Emperors were revived by Astral, but they were once again humans as they were in the past. He also used its powers to revive Kite Tenjo, Ponta and Eliphas to restore peace to the Earth. According to Eliphas, Astral fused the Barian World and Astral World using the reality warping artifact. Thus the Different-Dimension War concluded with peace and harmony between the three realms.
