 Biography 
 The chief was investigating the  Playing Card Bomber , who had been setting off a series of bombs in  Domino City . While investigating, the chief would receive orders from the bomber to bring a Deck of playing cards, which would be necessary in controlling which bombs go off. [1] 
 The chief went to  Domino Park  after a bomb scare. He was contacted by the bomber, who told him the bomb was in the Ferris wheel. After hearing this,  Yugi Mutou  came up to the chief, to tell him that his friend,  Anzu Mazaki  was on the Ferris wheel. The bomber asked the chief if he had brought the usual  deck of cards  and invited him to play a card game to find out which carriage the bomb was in. The chief asks if there was anyone good at card games, who could help. Yugi switched to  Dark Yugi  and volunteers. After playing a game of  clock solitaire  as requested, Dark Yugi was able to stop the bomber and report his location to the chief. [1]
