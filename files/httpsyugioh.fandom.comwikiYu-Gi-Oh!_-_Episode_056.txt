 Summary 
 As  Seto Kaiba  announces the start of the  Battle City , Yugi and Joey start moving around as everybody else does. Joey then spots the Rare Hunter who then identifies himself as ' Seeker '. Joey then challenges Seeker to an ánte duel so that he will be able to win back his " Red-Eyes Black Dragon . Seeker refuses to duel him, but wants to duel Yugi to get his " Dark Magician ". 
 Yugi agrees to duel him on the condition that should he win, Seeker should hand back Joey's "Red-Eyes Black Dragon". Seeker agrees. As the duel Starts, Joey tries to tell Yugi about Seeker's strategy, but Yugi tells him not to say so, as it would be unfair (In the dub, Seeker threatens that he would tear up Joey's "Red-Eyes Black Dragon" if Joey tried to tell Yugi). The Duel then continues. 
 At Kaiba's Control Center, he watches the duel taking place. He is informed that Yugi's opponent is one of the Rare Hunters and had hacked into Kaiba Corp Mainframe to enlist himself as participants. Hearing this, Mokuba tries to go and stop the duel and disqualify him, but Kaiba refrains him from doing so (as he wants the other  Egyptian God  Cards from the Rare Hunters). 
       Yugi meets with Duelists from  Duelist Kingdom .

 Differences in adaptations 
 The word "Close" on Grandpa's door is replaced with a red circle and a line through it. 
 The word "Almondo" is removed from the coffee shop. 
 A sign behind Rex that says "Domino Station" is removed. Also DR is removed from his hat. 
 The words "Duel Disk" on Kaiba's blimp is removed from the dub. 
 In the dub, like in the previous episode, the duelists' rankings are changed from a level to a number of stars. 
 The info of the Rare Hunter (in Japanese) is removed from the dub. 
 In the dub, prior to Yugi figuring out Seeker's strategy and revealing it, Seeker threatened Joey that if he reveals the strategy he used to beat him in their duel, then he will tear up his " Red-Eyes Black Dragon " card. This is not present in the original, with Yami Yugi saying he has no right to know his strategy. 
 Also in the dub, Kaiba's real reason for not letting Mokuba disqualify Seeker is less about getting an Egyptian God Card and more about watching Yugi get defeated by Exodia, just like how Yugi  defeated him with it . 
 Errors 
 Yami Yugi's head appears larger than normal when he is first shown looking at his/Yugi's deck. 
 When  Seeker  is looking through his computer at which duelist to fight next, it first shows Yugi and Mai and as the Rare Hunter continues looking and stops at the profiles of  Sid  and  Zygor  (both 3 stars in the dub and level 5 in the original). However, when Joey comes up and confronts the man, the next scene that shows enough of the computer reveals it has Yugi and Mai on it again. 
 Trivia 
 At the start of Seeker's second turn, he predicts he will draw another Graceful Charity, and afterwards plays it, saying that he'd been correct.  However, since before a Graceful Charity was seen in his hand, and afterwards none is, either he was lying, having drawn a different card and then activating the Graceful Charity he already had in his hand; or else it is an error.
