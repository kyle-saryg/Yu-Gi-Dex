 In the dubbed version of the  anime , the cards featured in the artwork of "7 Completed" take on their  manga  appearance, being white and featuring the same Japanese text. They still retain the colored artwork. 
 The Japanese version shows the Japanese characters for ATK and DEF, Magic Card and 7 Completed, while other language versions printed them in English. The European versions excluded the words "Magic Card" and the card name from the depicted cards. 
 An English artwork with no card name for the three "7 Completed"s was made. 
 In  Yu-Gi-Oh! Duel Monsters 4: Battle of Great Duelist , "7 Completed" was drawn with a different artwork.
