       Young Getta.     
 Getta is a stocky boy with a rough-cut look to him. He has brown eyes with heavy eyebrows and a strip of tape across his nose; and his dark blue hair, with a lighter plume in the front, is held up by a spring-green headband. He wears a dark forest-green sleeveless moto jacket over a short-sleeved white shirt, and has medium green colored pants with brown shoes, along with dark brown finger-less gloves that have ringed purple cuffs.
 
 Etymology 
 Getta's full name is a pun on the japanese phrase "tairage da", "to eat everything", referring to his role in eating all of the food in Seven Hells Hall to make Romin hungry.
