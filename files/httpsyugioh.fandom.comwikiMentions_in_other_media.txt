 Yu-Gi-Oh!  has been referenced several times in  MAD :
 In the sketch "Grey's in Anime", a patient hallucinates that one female doctor has Yugi's hair. She summons the "Dark Physician" (which looks like the " Dark Magician ") to heal the patient, only to be stopped by a rival doctor's "Malpractice" Trap Card, suing "Dark Physician" and making him unable to heal. The female doctor protests that they must work together, and the male doctor says, "I can heal the patient all by myself!" holding his arm up to a similar pose that Seto Kaiba did during  Yugi and   Kaiba's Duel   with   Lumis and Umbra . 
 In the sketch "Pokémon Park", when leaving "Pokémon Island",  Misty  asks  Ash  about "Digimon Island" and "Yu-Gi-Oh! Island". Ash replies by saying that they are "more complicated, but less fun". 
 One sketch, "Yu-Gi-Bear!", is a mash-up of  Yu-Gi-Oh!  and  Yogi Bear . The sketch features Yogi Bear wearing an item similar to the Millennium Puzzle, allowing Yogi Bear to transform into Yugi Bear (basically just Yogi Bear wearing a coat and hair similar to Yugi's) and he starts a Duel with Park Ranger Smith over a family's "pic-a-nic basket", despite the family's willingness to share their food. We see that Ranger Smith has an " Amazon of the Seas " Monster Card, but Yugi Bear counters with his "Smarter Than The Av-a-rage Bear" Trap Card (which looks like a bear holding a diploma and wearing a graduation hat). The Duel starts to bore the family. Regardless, Yugi Bear and Ranger Smith continue the Duel. Ranger Smith Special Summons " Gigaplant " with 2400 ATK, but Yugi Bear Summons "Boo-Boo Eyed White Dragon" (which looks like Dino from  The Flintstones  with Boo-Boo's head) with 3000 ATK, but just as Yugi Bear is about to explain its effect, Ranger Smith points out that the family has left.

 In the  Mysticons  episode " The Prophecy Unleashed ", while the Mysticons, Nova Terron, and Proxima head into a cave to recover the Spectral Dragon Egg, Malvaron and Gandobi stand guard outside. To pass the time, they play a game called "Beastie Blasters", which is a parody of  Yu-Gi-Oh!  Gandobi  summons  a "Stargoyle", which he orders to attack Malvaron with " Celestial Tail Smash " (possibly a reference to  attacking your opponent's Life Points directly ). Malvaron counters by summoning an "Undercity Jaws" (a creature seen in previous episodes of  Mysticons ) and ordering it to attack "Stargoyle", which it does by eating the latter. Malvaron taunts Gandobi before his next attempt to summon a Monster, saying, "What are you going to play next? 'Fluffy Funganoid?'" (a Funganoid also being a creature in previous episodes) not realizing that Tazma is getting away with the Spectral Dragon Egg. When he does, he summons a "Star Foz-ia" (a Foz being a common creature in the show). Gandobi mentions that it has 300 Hit Points (likely a reference to  ATK ) and the most deadly attack in the game, which Malvaron calls out: "Hangry Stargaze of Doom". The  Monster  destroys the spectres in the sky.
