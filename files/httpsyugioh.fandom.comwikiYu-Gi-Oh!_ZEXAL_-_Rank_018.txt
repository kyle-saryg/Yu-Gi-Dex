 "Kaito Again!!"  is the eighteenth chapter of the  Yu-Gi-Oh! ZEXAL  manga . 
 This chapter was first printed in the 7/2012 issue of  V Jump , released on May 21, 2012.
 Yuma  is about to lose his  Duel  against  Cologne , when  a strange event  happens, turning the tables. At the end of that fierce battle, who appears again in Yuma's way is the  Numbers Hunter  who once defeated Yuma -  Kaito !
 
 Summary 
         " Gagaga Girl " shows " Zombiestein " what he looks like.     
 Yuma  is about to lose his  Duel  against  Cologne , when  a strange event  happens; Yuma looks at "Zombiestein" and notes his "unique" effect: "This card cannot attack  female  monsters". " Zombiestein " stops his attack against " Gagaga Girl ", and gives her flowers. However, she takes a photo of his face and shows him, to tell "Zombiestein" how ugly he is. This causes "Zombiestein" to get shocked at his own face. Then, Yuma Summons " Gagaga Magician "; this makes "Gagaga Girl" get embarrassed, and "Zombiestein" then thinks "Gagaga Magician" is her boyfriend.
 Using the " Gagaga " duo and his own " Number ", Yuma manages to defeat Cologne, but the impact of his last attack throws her inside the " Doll House ", which is still on fire.  At that time,  Cathy  dives into the flames and tries to save her, saying that she was the one who abandoned Cologne, and had to save her. Cathy's noble attitude makes Yuma and  Kotori  get shocked, but in the hurry, Cathy mistakes and gets out of the fire carrying one of Cologne's dolls. This time, Yuma decides to go save Cologne, but, who comes out of the Doll House carrying her in his arms is  Grandpa Demetto ! Cologne's soul was supposed to leave her body, but Demetto gave her his own soul, which allowed her to stay alive. While he sends Cologne out of the fire towards Yuma, he is engulfed by the flames together with the field. 
 Cologne mourns the death of Demetto, who she loved. As she had nowhere to go now, Yuma invites her to live with him in  his house . Cologne asks him why he is doing that, and he answers saying that everybody that Duels him becomes his friend. Cologne accepts Yuma's invitation, becoming friends with him and the rest of the gang.
 Yuma, the  Numbers Club  and Cologne then run towards an iron bridge in order to escape from the  Heartland Theme Park , but the exit locks, and  Kaito  and  Orbital 7  appear. Kaito challenges Yuma to a Duel in order to obtain his " Numbers ", but  Mr. Heartland  shows up from the upper stairs, interrupting them. Mr. Heartland smiles and orders Kaito to defeat the messenger from the  Astral World  in front of him. However, Kaito refuses to follow his method, and triggers Orbital 7's self-destruct mechanism, kicking him towards Yuma's gang, which destroys part of the bridge. This makes Yuma and his friends fall in the water under them, which allow them to escape. Mr. Heartland tells Kaito that this action was a big act of disobedience towards him and  Dr. Faker . Kaito and Mr. Heartland, both irritated, stare at each other for few seconds. Kaito then just turns around and leaves the room, ordering Orbital 7 to go with him.
 As Yuma and the others leave the park, Cologne explains to them that Kaito has became a  Numbers Hunter  to protect his  little brother , who is ill.  Astral  tells Yuma that even though Kaito's reasons are noble, as long as he continues being a Numbers Hunter, someday they'll have to fight each other. Yuma replies saying that he knows that, and when that happens, he will not lose.
 Meanwhile,  a hooded person  approaches  Shark .
 
 Featured Duel: Yuma Tsukumo vs. Cologne 
 Duel continues from  the previous Rank . 
 Turn 9: Cologne 
 Cologne   attacks  " Gagaga Girl " with " No. 22: Zombiestein ", but the attack is stopped as "Zombiestein" cannot attack  female   monsters .
 Turn 10: Yuma 
 Yuma   Normal Summons  " Gagaga Magician " (1500/1000). He  activates  the  effect  of "Gagaga Girl", changing its  Level  to that of "Gagaga Magician" - 4. He  overlays  his two  Level  4 monsters to  Xyz Summon  " No. 39: Utopia " (2500/2000). The second effect of "Gagaga Girl" activates, reducing the  ATK  of "Zombiestein" to 0. Yuma attacks "Zombiestein" with "Utopia", destroying it (Cologne 2200 → 0).
