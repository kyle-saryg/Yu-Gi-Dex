       Single     
 " 99% " ( ９９％ ,  Kyūjūkyū Pāsento ) is the second Japanese opening theme to  Yu-Gi-Oh! Duel Monsters GX  anime series. The song is performed by a Japanese group called  BOWL . The lyrics were written by Maruyama Kazuhiro while the music was composed by the collaboration of him and Nishikido Atsushi. It debuted in Japan on October 5, 2005. This opening theme was used during the second half of the first season. The song replaced " Fine Weather Rising Hallelujah " in  episode 34  and was replaced by the same song with a different sequence of pictures in  episode 53 . 
 The second OP sequence was played during season 2. There are two slightly different versions of the sequence; the first version plays the same scene of Aster summoning "Archlord Zerato" and features Dr. Crowler smiling at the end; the second replaces the summoning scene with a clip of the current episode's Duel, and Dr. Crowler's expression becomes a defeated one.
 This was followed by " Teardrop ".

 Kagi o kaketa heya hitoribocchi de kimi ga naiteta
 
 In a locked room, you wept alone
 
 
 Utsumuku sono me ni kinou bakari utsushite mo susume ya shinai sa
 
 Even if only yesterday reflects in your downcast eyes, you won’t move forward
 
 
 Asa ni nattara mukae ni yuku yo minna onaji sa, yowai kedo
 
 When it’s morning, I’ll go greet you; everyone is the same, weak
 
 
 Soko ni katte nante hontou wa nai n da kimi ga kanjiteru hodo
 
 But the truth is, there is no wall there as much as you feel there is
 
 
 Ikigurushī nara kakuretecha dame da to shitteru kuse ni sa
 
 Even when you know that you mustn’t hide it if it’s suffocating
 
 
 Kimi o tsuredashite doko e mukaou ka machi no kaze wa mada tsumetai kedo
 
 Where will we head to when I take you out? The town’s wind is still cold
 
 
 Ashita o kimetsuke unzarishinaide ikou shiranai basho e
 
 But without scolding or getting tired of tomorrow, let’s go to an unknown place
 
 
 Seotta sono omori wa kimi dake no mono ja nai n da yo
 
 The weight that you carried doesn’t belong to you alone
 
 
 Boku ni wakete goran kono te o hanasanaide ite
 
 Share it with me; don’t let go of my hand
 
 
 Asa ni nattara mukae ni yuku yo kimi o…
 
 When it’s morning, I’ll go greet you…
 
 
 Soto e tsuredashite doko e mukaou ka machi no kaze wa mada tsumetai kedo
 
 Where will we head to when I take you outside? The town’s wind is still cold
 
 
 Kyūjūkyū pāsento wakaranai kara asu o tashikame ni ikou
 
 Because we don’t understand 99 percent, let’s go ascertain tomorrow
