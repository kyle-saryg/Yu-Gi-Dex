 Biography 
 Arc League Championship 
 Taka was first seen among the other Bandit Warrior Academy students in a stadium. Later on, he and his partner Nagi were called in to Duel against the Pioneer of Pendulum Summoning. Taka's harsh Dueling style made it hard for Yuya to attack and virtually impossible for him to grab any Action Cards. However, the tide of the battle was turned when Dennis decided to step in Taka's Duel. The Bandit Warrior Academy pair lost, quite ashamed of themselves. Nico Smiley announced their loss to the Duelists' spectators.
 Later on, Taka, along with Nagi, challenged Yugo to a Duel, whom they confused for Yuya. Taka and Nagi lost the Duel and became unconscious. Yugo asked them a question, but they did not answer.
 
 Deck 
 Taka uses a  Wind Star Deck  focused on  Fusion Summoning  his ace monster, " Fujin the Breakstorm Star ". Much like the rest of the  Bandit Warrior Academy   Duelists , he uses martial arts to attack his opponent during  Action Duels  to prevent them from getting  Action Cards .
