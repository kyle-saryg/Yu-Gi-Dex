 Use cards that  mill  your own Deck to increase your chances of drawing this card. 
 Note that this card's effect specifies  normal draw , so you cannot use cards like " Heart of the Underdog " or " Reload " during your Draw Phase in an attempt to draw this card. 
 This card also does not specify that you must draw an "Afterglow" shuffled into the Deck by this card. You can activate this card to banish multiple copies of "Afterglow", then use the effect of " Thunder Dragonduo " to return one of the banished "Afterglow" on top of your Deck.
