 History 
 They were first seen being worn by  Allen Kozuki , who used them to look for  Saya . [1]  He then gives them to  Yuya , passing on his feelings to him. [2]  Yuya first used the Rollerboots in his Duel against  Iggy Arlo  to dodge his assaults while finding  Action Cards , which successfully helped him win the Duel. [3]  He used them again in his Duel against  Captain Cutter , but when Yuya skated up the rope for an Action Card, Cutter had the ship to turn hard knocking Yuya off in to the ocean until  Crow   saved  him. [4]  When  Duel Academy  students surrounded the  Lancers , Yuya used them to evade the students while initiating their own plan. [5]  When Yuya used them against the  Battle Beast , he was blocked from getting an Action Card due the Battle Beast's sheer speed and agility. [6]  When he was being  attacked directly  by  Sanders ' " Gladiator Beast Tamer Editor ", Yuya used them with " Evasion " to dodge it. [7]  When Battle Beast used the effect of " Gladiator Beast's Assault Fort " to inflict damage, Yuya used them to grab " Acceleration ", dodging the first attack but couldn't find an Action Card for the second and was saved by  Jack 's  Red Gazer . [8]  When  Leo  attacked Yuya directly with " D/D/D Doom King Armageddon ", he used them to grab "Evasion" and dodge the attack. [9]  When Yuri attacked him with " Dark Rebellion Xyz Dragon ", Yuya used them to grab " Miracle " but Yuri destroyed it with " Crush Action " to prevent him from using his  face-down . This would be the final time Yuya would use the Rollerboots as they were destroyed when  Z-ARC  took control of him. [10] 
 Following  Z-ARC 's defeat and the  Standard Dimension  being reborn into the  "Pendulum Dimension" , the Rollerboots were restored and Yuya used them to get to  You Show Duel School . When  Frederick ,  Tate , and  Allie  asked Yuya where he got them from, he told them that someone gave them to him but couldn't remember who it was due to losing most of his memories. [11]  Yuya would use them in the  Battle Royal  against  Gong ,  Sylvio , and  Moon Shadow  to get Action Cards and travel throughout " Quartet of Quandry ". [12] [13]  He would also use them against  Dennis , but was stopped by " Performage Trapeze High Magician " twice from getting an action card. [14]  Yuya used them to grab " No Action " and " Encore " during his Duel with  Shay . [15]  He uses them for the final time in his Duel against  Declan . [16]
