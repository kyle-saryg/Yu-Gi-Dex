 満タンなエネルギーは行き場をなくして困ってるぜ 
誰かがちょっと揺らすだけで退屈は破裂するぜ 
 
I Ride, White Lineの上を Oh, Oh, Oh, 
Sit down 信頼してる場所で Oh, Oh, Oh, 
迷ってる間に行けるぜ！ 
 
＊ひとりにひとつずつもらえる自由と情熱を手に 
輝くために生まれてきた僕らの旅は続く 
不確かな日常を支える切り札 お前のSoul 
Bestな成長は生み出すよ 止まらないWILD DRIVE 
僕らはまだ静かに扉を叩いてる 
 
Willは Beatを探して なりふりかまわずに行く 
すべての Mightyな風 たやすく蹴散らして Fly 
 
Freeに生きることの意味を Oh, Oh, Oh, 
Greedに目を伏せ手を振れば Oh, Oh, Oh, 
Stand up その時だぜ 
 
＊Repeat 
 
地球はいたずらに大地を Oh, Oh, Oh, 
ふるわせ調子に乗り過ぎて Oh, Oh, Oh, 
あっという間に行きなよ 
 
ひとりにひとつずつもらえる自由と情熱を手に 
輝くために生まれてきた僕らの旅は続く 
 
＊Repeat 
 
扉を叩いてる

 the full charged energy doesn't know where to go and is lost  
just a small touch will make it explode 
 
I ride on top of the white line oh oh oh  
sit down, to that place I trust oh oh oh  
we can get there while we ponder! 
 
with the freedom and passion that everyone can have  
the journey for us who were born to shine continues  
your soul is the best bet to support the unexpected days  
the best growth brings forth  
an unstoppable wild drive 
 
we're still tapping on the door quietly 
 
the will searches for a beat and continues on without worries  
kicking away all of the mighty  winds and fly 
 
the meaning of living free oh oh oh  
if you look away from greed and wave oh oh oh  
stand up, it's that time 
 
with the freedom and passion that everyone can have  
the journey for us who were born to shine continues  
your soul is the best bet to support the unexpected days  
the best growth brings forth  
an unstoppable Wild Drive 
 
we're still tapping on the door quietly 
 
the earth plays a prank on the land oh oh oh  
making it tremble and going ou tof hand oh oh oh  
just go in no time 
 
with the freedom and passion that everyone can have  
the journey for us who were born to shine continues 
 
with the freedom and passion that everyone can have  
the journey for us who were born to shine continues  
your soul is the best bet to support the unexpected days  
the best growth brings forth  
an unstoppable Wild Drive 
 
we're still tapping on the door quietly 
 
knocking on the door
