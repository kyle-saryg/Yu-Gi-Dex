 Summary 
 Yuma  and  Shark  are down to 2400 and 1100  LP , respectively, in their  Tag-Team Duel  against  Scorch  and  Chills . Yuma says that at this rate they'll be in trouble, but Shark points out that " Number 61: Volcasaurus " has no more  Overlay Units , so its  effect  can no longer be used. Yuma is now excited, saying the battle is just beginning. Scorch tells them they'll be done soon no matter what and that Shark will be the first to go. "Volcasaurus"  attacks   directly , but Shark  activates  his  face-down  " Zeus' Breath " to  negate  the attack. Scorch is surprised and Yuma is relieved. Scorch says that their  fields  are still empty - they'll be finished next  turn . Scorch  Sets  two cards and ends his turn. 
 
       "Utopia"  frozen by " Avalanche ".     
 Yuma  draws  and then  Normal Summons  " Goblindbergh ", which activates its effect. He  Special Summons  " Gagaga Magician " from his  hand  in  Attack Position . Shark comments that he has two  Level  4 monsters and  Astral  tells Yuma to wait. Yuma overlays his two monsters to  Xyz Summon  " Number 39: Utopia " in Attack Position.  Tori  is happy to see "Utopia", but  Bronk  says it doesn't matter - Yuma is still relying on " Numbers ". The eyes of Scorch and Chills glow red as they say they've been waiting for this. Chills activates his face-down " Avalanche ", which covers "Utopia" in ice. This prevents it from attacking and Yuma will take 500  damage  should he activate any of its effects. Shark comments its a  Trap Card  specifically designed to counter Xyz Monsters and Astral calls Yuma's move a careless Summon.
 
       Yuma  protects  Shark , surprising him.     
 Yuma  Sets  two cards to end his turn. Scorch believes that as long as the "Numbers" is frozen, they have the Duel won and tells Chills to finish them in one shot. Chills begins his turn and switches " Icebergdon " to Attack Position.He tells Shark this is the end and attacks him directly. Shark braces for the impact, but Yuma declares he is activating the effect of "Utopia" - he can negate an attack by  detaching  an Overlay Unit. Shark says that's impossible and asks if he forgot the effect of "Avalanche". Yuma says he told him before - they are friends. Utopia negates the attack with  "Moon Barrier"  and Yuma's LP drop to 1900 as he's lifted off the ground by icy winds.
 
       " Pompadour Blizzardon " and " Icebergdon ".     
 Tori screams Yuma's name and Bronk speculates that Yuma Summoned "Utopia" to protect Shark. Shark is a bit perturbed, saying Yuma always does unnecessary things. Chills taunts that that was a touching display of friendship. He says another attack is coming and attacks Shark directly with " Pompadour Blizzardon ". Yuma uses "Moon Barrier" to negate the attack again, dropping his LP to 1400 and dropping him back to the ground. Yuma curses and Shark asks what's wrong - at the rate they're going, Yuma may as well keep sleeping on the ground. Yuma tells him to be quiet and says he was just resting a bit - and that the game is just beginning. Chills and Scorch say that they still don't realize just how powerful they are. Scorch activates his face-down " Volcanic Ash ", switching "Pompadour Blizzardon" to  Defense Position . Yuma questions what the point of that was and Chills thanks Scorch. With that, he can activate " Frozen Ice Cave ", which increases the Level of one Defense Position monster by 1. Therefore "Pompadour Blizzardon" becomes Level 5 and Chills overlays it with "Icebergdon" to Xyz Summon " Number 19: Freezerdon ", who initially appears as a giant, spear-tipped ice block before moving to its  Dinosaur  form. 
 
         " Number 19: Freezerdon " is Summoned.     
 Yuma says that's the second "Numbers" and Chills activates the effect of "Freezerdon". By detaching an Overlay Unit, it brings back the Overlay Units for another Xyz Monster. The two Units of "Volcasaurus" return. Yuma and Astral are shocked, as this means they can use  "Magma Max"  again. Chills Sets two cards as he and Scorch laugh, saying that no one has ever beaten them in a Tag Duel. Astral says that something isn't right here and Shark tells him it's as expected - Scorch and Chills are cheating. Yuma and Chills both ask what he means and Shark tells Chills not to play dumb. They're been using one cheap trick after another. Astral asks Yuma what cheating means, he says that means they're fighting dirty. Astral asks if this means the Duel is unfair and Shark says he expected nothing less from them. From the beginning, they knew what cards the other would draw and in what order. He speculates that they rigged the auto- shuffle  function of their  Duel Disks . Yuma says that makes sense, - that's how they both knew the other had a Level 5 monster in their hands. Astral adds that the combo with "Frozen Ice Cave" falls under the same category. He says that Scorch and Chills cannot truly call themselves  Duelists . Shark says that a true Duelist would never cheat like that. Chills tells him to stop speculating and Scorch adds that Shark himself cheated at the National Championships. He add that "Champion candidate" was never a good term to describe Shark, he was nothing but a cheat that spied on his opponent's Deck in the waiting room.
 
         Reginald loses in the National Duel Circuit.     
 Flashbacks to the event are shown. Spectators fill the stands as an announcer states that at last the finals of the  Duel Monsters  National Championship will begin. The Champion candidate is well on his way to victory. In the waiting room, Shark mutters to himself that he must win. Another  man  leaves the room and Shark hears cards hit the floor. He looks over where he heard the noise and sees his opponent's Deck on the ground. Four cards are face-up - " Necrovalley ", " Skill Drain ", " Mirror Force " and " Gravekeeper's Descendant ". At the finals, the crowd cheers Shark's name. The announcer says they are at last at the climax of the championship Duel. Shark has " Big Jaws " on the field and again mutters that he must win. His opponent Sets a card, and Shark wonders if it's "Mirror Force". He has a counter for that, so he'll win. As he is about to begin his turn, red crosses adorned with the word "STOP" cover the field. The commentator announces that Shark has been disqualified for foul play as he unfairly checked his opponent's Deck. Scorch says that because of that, Shark was forever exiled from the Dueling stage. 
 Shark mutters that he's afraid of losing and Chills laughs as he and Scorch both taunt him. Yuma yells for them to stop and asks what's so funny about being afraid of losing. Yuma says he's scared too. Whenever he thinks of losing, he's paralyzed with fear. That's why he used "Numbers" against Shark. He lied, it was not to save Shark. But that is why he decided he would never lie in a Duel again. He says it must be the same for Shark and that that is what makes Shark a true Duelist. No matter what dirty tricks their opponents use, he and Shark will fight fair and square for victory. Chills says they sure talk big, but Scorch reminds them have nothing on the field but a frozen "Number", which will do them no good. Shark tells Yuma that they will win this Duel.
 
         " Needle Sunfish " and " Big Jaws ".     
 Shark activates " Xyz Gift ", drawing two cards as there are two or more Xyz Monsters on the field. He Normal Summons " Needle Sunfish " and activates " Surface ", Special Summoning "Big Jaws" from his  Graveyard  in Defense Position. Yuma realizes what Shark will do and Shark overlays his two monsters to Xyz Summon " Black Ray Lancer " in Attack Position. Shark activates its effect, detaching the overlaid "Needle Sunfish" to negate the effects of "Volcasaurus" until the  End Phase . Yuma is excited, as now they can destroy the "Numbers". Scorch points out that "Volcasaurus" still has 2500  ATK  and Shark calls him naive. He reveals that when "Needle Sunfish" is sent to the Graveyard, it decreases the ATK of one monster by 500. "Needle Sunfish" appears and launches spiked missiles from its mouth, which hit "Volcasaurus", reducing its ATK to 2000. Astral is surprised that Shark made a comeback int his sort of situation.
 
         Yuma's hand being shown.     
 "Black Ray Lancer" attacks "Volcasaurus" with  "Shimmering Spear Slash" , but Chills activates his face-down " Compensation Exchange ", negating the attack but inflicting the ATK of "Volcasaurus" to himself in exchange. Yuma thinks it's odd that Chills took the hit and Scorch says that he'll attack, while Chills will defend. Chills says that that is their fighting style. Scorch activates his face-down " Volcanic Abyss ", checking Yuma's hand. He may return a monster in it to Yuma's Deck. Yuma wonders why he's do this and Astral says it is to prevent him from Summoning a monster on his next turn. His hand contains " Monster Reborn " and " Gogogo Golem "; both cards appear as holograms in front of all players, and Shark takes note what Yuma's hand contains. Scorch believes that Yuma will not be able to use "Monster Reborn" effectively and "Gogogo Golem" returns to the Deck. Shark Sets a card.
 
         Chills  loses to protect  his brother .     
 Scorch says this turn will be their end and draws. He says Shark will be first and activates the effect of "Volcasaurus", detaching an Overlay Unit to destroy a monster and inflict damage to its  controller  equal to its ATK. Yuma yells Shark's name as Scorch declares the effect, "Mag-Max". "Black Ray Lancer" is destroyed, but Yuma activates his face-down " Damage Diet ", which halves all damage they take this turn. Shark's LP fall to 50. Shark activates his face-down " Icy Crevasse ", declaring "Volcasaurus" as the target. This will destroy it and inflict damage to Scorch equal to its ATK. The ground around "Volcasaurus" cracks open and it begins to fall. Chills activates his face-down " Forced Change ", changing the target of "Icy Crevasse" to "Freezerdon". It falls through the ground as Chills's LP fall to 0 and Scorch screams his name. Scorch is livid, asking how they dare do that to his little brother. Saying there's no turning back now, he activates "Mag-Max" again, destroying "Utopia", "Damage Diet" halving the damage, leaving Yuma with 150 LP. Scorch declares it as a useless trick and attacks Shark directly with "Volcasaurus". Shark activates his face-down " Final Offering ", ending the Battle Phase and giving an opponent one card from his hand. He tosses a card from his hand to Yuma, who is surprised to find he's considered an opponent in terms of the card effect. Scorch calls it a useless struggle and activates " Twin Volcano ". During his  Standby Phase , it will inflict 500 damage. He may also  send  it to the Graveyard to inflict another 500 damage. Astral says that this means that if Scorch gets another turn, both their LP will be 0. Chills taunts that it will be their victory and Scorch tells them to prepare themselves. Shark tells Yuma not to give up - they still have a chance to win.
 
         " Black Ray Lancer " combined with " Number 39: Utopia " by the  effect  of " Armored Xyz ".     
 Yuma draws and examines his hand, wondering how they can win. Shark believes that Yuma will see what it is. Astral wonders if Yuma will realize what he needs to do. Yuma sees as his only move as activating "Monster Reborn" to  revive  "Utopia", but then sees the " Armored Xyz " that Shark gave him. He remembers when Astral told him that "Monster Reborn" can revive monsters from the opponent's Graveyard as well. Yuma activates "Monster Reborn" and Bronk wonders if he'll Special Summon "Utopia". Yuma Special Summons the "Black Ray Lancer" from Shark's Graveyard in Attack Position. Scorch asks why he'd choose that monster, it has lower ATK than "Utopia" - an amateur move. Shark tells him not to be so sure of that and Yuma plays "Armored Xyz". This  equips  an Xyz Monster from Yuma's Graveyard to "Black Ray Lancer". The two monsters combine, giving "Black Ray Lancer" 2500 ATK. Scorch says it matters not, only a "Number" can defeat another "Number". Shark says this card can defeat a "Number" as "Black Ray Lancer" will gain all the effects of "Utopia", with Yuma adding that it becomes a "pseudo-Number" of sorts. "Black Ray Lancer" destroys "Volcasaurus" and Scorch's LP drop to 1900. 
 
         Yuma and Shark win the  Tag-Team Duel .     
 Shark and Yuma reveal that by sending "Utopia" to the Graveyard, "Black Ray Lancer" can attack again. It attacks directly with "Black Spear" (cut from the dub is a shot of the spear going through Scorch), defeating Scorch, blasting both him and Chills backwards onto the ground. Bronk and Tori excitedly jump and Astral declares his twelfth observation as he absorbs the two "Numbers" - "this is your way of Dueling". Astral's memories are the  Astral World  being hit by numerous explosions as the unseen inhabitants scream. Scorch and Chills groggily awake and Chills questions why they'd steal cards. When they see Shark, they leap to their feet and run away. Tori yells for them to never come back again. Yuma turns to Bronk and apologizes for lying. With a bit of urging from Tori, Bronk accepts the apology and asks Yuma to Duel him. Yuma says that sounds great and sees Shark has turned to go. Yuma moves to return "Armored Xyz" to him, but Shark tells him to keep it, as he's grown a bit from being a "no-good Duelist". Shark tells Yuma he'll see him later and walks to his motorcycle as Yuma smiles.
 
 Featured Duels 
 Yuma Tsukumo and Reginald Kastle vs. Scorch and Chills 
 Duel continues from  the previous episode . 
 Turn 5: Scorch 
" Number 61: Volcasaurus "  attacks   Shark   directly , but Shark  activates  his  face-down  " Zeus' Breath " to  negate  the attack.  Scorch   Sets  two cards. 
 Turn 6: Yuma 
 Yuma   draws . He then  Normal Summons  " Goblindbergh " ( 4/1400/0) in Attack Position. As "Goblindbergh" was Normal Summoned, Yuma activates its  effect  to  Special Summon  " Gagaga Magician " ( 4/1500/1000) from his  hand  in  Attack Position  (as its Level is at most 4). Yuma  overlays  "Gagaga Magician" and "Goblindbergh" in order to  Xyz Summon  " Number 39: Utopia " ( 4/2500/2000, ORU: 2) in Attack Position. As an  Xyz Monster  was successfully Summoned, Chills activates his face-down " Avalanche " by targeting "Utopia". Now "Utopia" can't attack and Yuma will take 500  damage  each time "Utopia" activates an effect. Yuma Sets two cards.
 Turn 7: Chills 
 
                 No. 19 Freezerdon   "Freezerdon" is Summoned.     
 Chills draws. He then switches " Icebergdon " ( 5/1300/2100) to Attack Position. "Icebergdon" attacks Shark directly, but Yuma activates the effect of "Utopia" to  detach  an Overlay Unit ("Utopia": 2 → 1 ORU) and negate the attack. The effect of "Avalanche" activates (Yuma: 2400 → 1900 LP). " Pompadour Blizzardon " attacks Shark directly, but Yuma activates the effect of "Utopia" ("Utopia": 1 → 0 ORU) to negate the attack. The effect of "Avalanche" activates again (Yuma 1900 → 1400). 
 Scorch activates his face-down " Volcanic Ash " to switch "Pompadour Blizzardon" to Defense Position. Chills activates " Frozen Ice Cave " to target "Pompadour Blizzardon" (as it's currently in Defense Position and increase its Level by 1 ("Blizzardon":   4 → 5). Chills overlays "Icebergdon" and "Pompadour Blizzardon" in order to Xyz Summon " Number 19: Freezerdon " ( 5/2000/2500, ORU: 2) in Defense Position. Chills then activates the effect of "Freezerdon" to detach an Overlay Unit ("Freezerdon": 2 → 1 ORU) and return " Flamesaurus " and " Baggy Pants Lavasaurus " from the Graveyard to "Volcasaurus" as Overlay Units (as both "Flamesaurus" and "Baggy Pants Lavasaurus" were used for the Xyz Summon of "Volcasaurus" and were in the  Graveyard  at the time) ("Volcasaurus": 0 → 2 ORU). Chills Sets two cards.
 Turn 8: Shark 
Shark draws " Xyz Gift " and subsequently activates it to draw two cards as there are two or more Xyz Monsters on the  field . He then Normal Summons " Needle Sunfish " ( 3/1500/100) in Attack Position. Shark activates " Surface " to revive " Big Jaws " ( 3/1800/300) in Defense Position (as "Big Jaws" is a WATER monster). Shark overlays "Needle Sunfish" and "Big Jaws" in order to Xyz Summon " Black Ray Lancer " ( 3/2100/600, ORU: 2) in Attack Position. 
 Shark activates the effect of "Black Ray Lancer" to detach "Needle Sunfish" ("Black Ray Lancer": 2 → 1 ORU) and negate the effects of "Volcasaurus" until the  End Phase . Since "Needle Sunfish" was sent to the Graveyard, Shark activates its effect to decrease the ATK of "Volcasaurus" by 500 ("Volcasaurus": 2500 → 2000 ATK). "Black Ray Lancer" attacks "Volcasaurus", but Chills activates his face-down " Compensation Exchange " to negate the attack and inflict the ATK of "Volcasaurus" to himself as  damage  (Chills: 4000 → 2000 LP). As effect damage was inflicted, Scorch activates his face-down " Volcanic Abyss " to let him look at Yuma's hand and return a  Monster Card  from it to the  Deck . Yuma's hand contains " Gogogo Golem " and " Monster Reborn ", so the former card is returned to Yuma's Deck. Shark Sets a card.
 
         " Freezerdon " is  destroyed .     
 Turn 9: Scorch 
Scorch draws. He then activates the effect of "Volcasaurus" ("Volcasaurus": 2 → 1 ORU) to destroy "Black Ray Lancer", but Yuma activates his face-down " Damage Diet ", which halves all effect damage his team takes this turn (Shark: 1100 → 50 LP). As a monster he controls was destroyed by his opponent's card effect, Shark activates his face-down " Icy Crevasse ", to target "Volcasaurus" and destroy it as well as inflict damage to its owner equal to its original ATK, but Chills activates his face-down " Forced Change " to change the target of "Icy Crevasse" to "Freezerdon", who is destroyed instead (Chills: 2000 → 0 LP). Scorch activates the effect of "Volcasaurus" ("Volcasaurus": 1 → 0 ORU) to destroy "Utopia" and "Damage Diet" halves the damage (Yuma: 1400 → 150 LP). 
 "Volcasaurus" attacks Shark directly, but Shark activates his face-down " Final Offering " to end the  Battle Phase  and let him  add a card  in his hand to that of one of his opponents. Per the rules of the  Tag-Team Duel , Yuma is considered an opponent as well as a partner, so he adds " Armored Xyz " to Yuma's hand. Scorch activates " Twin Volcano ", which will inflict 500 damage to an opponent during each of his  Standby Phases . Scorch may also send it to the Graveyard to inflict 500 damage.
 Turn 10: Yuma 
Yuma draws " Overconfidence ". Yuma's hand contains "Armored Xyz" and "Monster Reborn". He activates "Monster Reborn" to revive "Black Ray Lancer" ( 3/2100/600) in Attack Position and under his control. Yuma then activates "Armored Xyz", to target "Utopia" from his Graveyard and  equip  it to "Black Ray Lancer". While equipped with "Utopia", "Armored Xyz" has the name and ATK of "Black Ray Lancer" become the same as "Utopia" ("Black Ray Lancer": 2100 → 2500 ATK). "Black Ray Lancer" attacks and destroys "Volcasaurus" (Scorch 2400 → 1900). Yuma activates the last effect of "Armored Xyz" to send "Utopia" to the Graveyard and allow "Black Ray Lancer" to attack again ("Black Ray Lancer": 2500 → 2100 ATK). "Black Ray Lancer" attacks directly (Scorch 1900 → 0).
 
 Reginald Kastle vs. National Duel Circuit Finalist 
 The full  Duel  is not shown.  Shark   controls  " Big Jaws " ( 3/1800/300) while  his opponent  controls no  monsters . The opponent  Sets  a card. Because Shark saw some of his opponent's cards, he is disqualified.
