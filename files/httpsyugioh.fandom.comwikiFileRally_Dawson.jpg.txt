 He is marked as a thief by the  Sector Security , by having a  criminal mark  put on his face, which allows him to be tracked.

 Biography 
       Linework.     
 Rally along with  Yusei Fudo ,  Jack Atlas ,  Blitz ,  Tank  and  Nervin  lived together in  Satellite . Jack left the group after having differing goals with Yusei. Rally would often fluctuate between spending time with Jack and the others. He tried to encourage Jack to rejoin their friends.
 After Jack is invited to  New Domino City , he ties Rally up and leaves him float in a boat off the pier, in a scheme to get Yusei's " Stardust Dragon " and  Duel Runner , which were necessary to get to New Domino. Yusei saves Rally, who apologizes for the trouble.
 Later Rally acquires a chip for Yusei's new Duel Runner. In the Japanese anime, his friends worry Rally might have stolen it. In the English anime, Jack planted it where Rally would find it. [1] 
 After giving it to Yusei, they are confronted by the  Sector Security , who are looking for Rally. They tell Rally it is pointless to run, since they can track him with the signal emitted from the criminal mark, but Yusei uses his laptop to jam the signal. Yusei speeds off to distract the securities, while Rally and their friends make their escape.
 Yusei clears any extra criminal record Rally obtained that day by defeating a security,  Trudge , in a Duel, where the securities were to forget the events of that day, if he won. [1] 
 Before Yusei parts to duel Jack, Rally gives him " Turbo Booster ", which was Rally's most prized card. In the dub, it was said to have belonged to his father. [2] 
 Rally, along with  Blitz ,  Tank  and  Nervin  are captured by  Iliaster  and held captive to force Yusei to enter the  Fortune Cup . After Yusei made it to the finals, Jack ordered that they be released, saying Yusei wasn't going to run away. Rally and his friends are set free in a scrapyard with a monitor to watch the Fortune Cup final. They are surprised to see Yusei is dueling Jack and that Yusei now has a criminal mark.
 Rally and the others were then hanging out at the old subway until Yusei and Crow came. Through Crow's criminal mark, Sector Security tracks all of them down and Crow tells them to go to his hideout. Although Rally and the others went to the hideout quickly, Yusei and Crow were busy dueling two Sector Security Officers. When all the kids that Crow takes care of appear, Rally gets frustrated that the kids want Yusei's autograph while Tank suggests to get the autograph so he can sell it for a price. As a result, Rally kicks Tank in the buttocks.
 When Crow tells the story of the legendary man, Rally argues when Crow reaches the part about Sector Security and how how people in Satellite give up hope. When Crow tells the kids to go to bed, the kids argue that Rally, "a kid who is still in his diapers", doesn't need to.
 After witnessing the battle between  Kalin  and Yusei, Rally and the others tried to push Yusei's Duel Runner back to  Martha 's house. On the way, Rally and the others encountered thugs and gave them their Deck and clothes to pay a toll. They were then tricked by an old man who was just another thug and the thugs took off with the Duel Runner. Blister, impersonating Sector Security, managed to get the Duel Runner back before discovered that Rally is completely naked.
 After the events of a black smoke in Satellite, Rally vanishes, along with many others. However, later, when Yusei Duels  Roman Goodwin , and the  Dark Signer  realizes that he's about to lose the  Shadow Duel , Roman uses an evil spell to flee, and force Rally to take his place. Rally manages to play " Turbo Booster Cannon " and uses its effect to  destroy  " Earthbound Immortal Uru " and inflict damage to himself equal to its ATK in order to get Yusei to win the Duel. Rally then turns into dust but before he fades away he asks Yusei to protect Satellite. [3] 
 After Yusei's second Duel with Roman ends, he, (together with most of the people from Satellite sacrificed to the  Earthbound Immortals ) is resurrected.
 He was never seen or mentioned until  episode 150  when he's seen cheering on Yusei. His last appearance is in  episode 154 , where he and the rest of the gang are driving a truck in Satellite. They notice Yusei and Jack driving by during their duel, Rally cheering for Yusei as he passes.
