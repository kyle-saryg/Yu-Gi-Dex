 Twin Duelists!! 
 
 "Duel Dragons!!"  is the twenty-second chapter of the  Yu-Gi-Oh! 5D's  manga .
 This chapter was first printed on May 21, 2011 in the 06/2011 issue of the  V Jump  magazine. It was later reprinted in  volume 3  of the  tankōbon .
 
 Summary 
 After the  Skeleton Knight  appears,  Sect  yells that he'll crush  Yusei  and  Jack  with his  Duel Dragon , and then vanishes. Yusei and Jack keep in silence for a few seconds, when  Kalin  appears before them. He then  Summons  a monster in his  Duel Disk , and asks if that is the Duel Dragon Jack wants. 
 Back at  Rex Goodwin 's room,  Mina  arrives reporting that the winners of the  D1GP  were assaulted one after another by someone. Rex coldly smiles, saying that 5000 years have passed, and that he and Skeleton Knight were going to finish "the game" once and for all. 
 Then,  Aria  is shown Dueling against  Leo  and  Luna , all three having one monster on the  field , being Aria's " Alien Overlord ", Leo's " Power Tool Mecha Dragon ", and Luna's " Ancient Pixie Dragon ." Both Leo and Luna share the same  Duel Runner , field and  Life Points . The siblings seems to have the advantage, and Leo says that would make five that they had beaten in a row. Leo and Luna have 4000 life points, while Aria has 1900. Power Tool Mecha Dragon attacks and destroys "Alien Overlord", while "Ancient Pixie Dragon" attacks directly, causing Aria to lose the Duel. One of "Power Tool's" missiles, however, moves at the direction of two innocent girls, but  Crow  appears and defends them with his " Blackwing Tamer - Obsidian Hawk Joe ", and says if "those brats" had injured the audience, it'd damage the Turbo Duelists' reputation. He also notices that missile from Leo's Dragon had an incredible Sense with it. 
 Back to Yusei, Jack and Kalin, Yusei is impressed with Kalin's monster's pressure - which is " Jeweled Red Dragon Archfiend ". Jack gets out of his Duel Runner, saying that's his card, and orders Kalin to give it back to him. At that time, the Dragon loses its form, and its card is destroyed. Kalin says that a replica cannot satisfy the Duel Dragon. Jack asks if Kalin knows where the true card is, but he is stopped by Yusei, who says a Duel Dragon changed his friend Sect completely. As his only clue, he asks Jack and Kalin what more they know. Kalin then smiles and says both Yusei and Jack have the right of participating in the game betting on Duel Dragons. 
 Suddenly, a giant hologram of Rex Goodwin appears in the sky, asking if the Turbo Duelists from the D1GP had fun Dueling. He says that only the strongest survive in the D1GP, and that the weak should be excluded. Because of that, he hired alternative Turbo Duelists to do the job - Leo and Luna. He ends up by declaring the D1GP will now enter a new stage, in  Satellite . The chapter shifts back to Kalin, with him telling Yusei and Jack that the final battle will be in Satellite.
