 " The Chosen One " known in Japan as " Another King " is the thirteenth episode of the  Yu-Gi-Oh! SEVENS  anime. It aired in Japan on August 29, 2020.
 Yuga  draws " Sevens Road Magician ". But just when he thinks that he is going to lose for using an illegal card,  Otes  emerges from the ground! How did Yuga obtain "Sevens Road", and just who is Otes?!
 
 Featured Duel: Yuga Ohdo vs. Roa Kirishima 
 Duel continues from the previous episode . 
 Turn 4: Yuga Yuga has just drawn " Sevens Road Magician ", which would result in his disqualification, but  Otes  appears and reveals that "Sevens Road Magician" is actually a legal card, so the duel continues. 
 Yuga Normal Summons " Magical Beast Wolfram " (1100/100), then tributes it to Tribute Summon " Sevens Road Witch " (1600/1000). Yuga activates the effect of "Sevens Road Witch", letting him send 1 card from his hand to the GY to Special Summon 1 Level 7 or higher  DARK   Spellcaster  monster from his hand. He sends " Piercing! " to the GY and Special Summons "Sevens Road Magician" (2100/1500) in Attack Position. Since he Special Summoned "Sevens Road Magician" with its effect, "Sevens Road Witch" gains 400 ATK ("Sevens Road Witch": 1600 → 2000 ATK) until the End Phase. Yuga activates the effect of "Sevens Road Magician", sending the top card of his Deck ("Hydro Magician") to the GY to increase the ATK of "Sevens Road Magician" by 300 for each different Attribute in his GY until the End Phase ("Sevens Road Magician": 2100 → 3900 ATK). Yuga Sets 1 card. 
 "Sevens Road Witch" attacks and destroys " Royal Demon's Shout " (Roa: 2300 → 1500 LP). "Sevens Road Magician" attacks directly, but Roa activates his set Trap " King's Dignity ", shuffling a Level 1  Fiend  Normal Monster from his GY to his Deck to negate the attack. He shuffles " Royal Demon's Groupie " to his Deck. 
 Turn 5: Roa Since Roa has no cards in his hand, he draws five cards. Roa Normal Summons "Royal Demon's Groupie" (0/0) and "Royal Demon's Shout" (1200/0), then tributes "Royal Demon's Groupie" to Tribute Summon " Royal Demon's Punk " (1500/0). Roa activates the effect of "Royal Demon's Punk", letting him add 1 Level 6 or higher Fiend monster from his GY to his hand, but for the rest of the turn he cannot declare a direct attack. He adds " Royal Demon's Death Voice ", then tributes "Royal Demon's Punk" to Tribute Summon "Royal Demon's Death Voice" (1800/0). Since it was Tribute Summoned by tributing 1 Level 5 or higher monster, Roa activates the effect of "Royal Demon's Death Voice", letting him target 1 Level 8 or lower monster Yuga controls and have it lose ATK and DEF equal to its Level x 200. He targets "Sevens Road Magician" ("Sevens Road Magician": 2100 → 700 ATK).  
 Roa tributes "Royal Demon's Shout" and "Royal Demon's Death Voice" to Tribute Summon " Royal Demon's Heavymetal " (2500/0). Since it was Tribute Summoned by tributing 1 Level 5 or higher monster(s), Roa activates the effect of "Royal Demon's Heavymetal", letting him target the Level 8 or lower monster Yuga controls with the lowest level, destroy it and increase the ATK of "Royal Demon's Heavymetal" by the ATK of the destroyed monster. He destroys "Sevens Road Witch" ("Royal Demon's Heavymetal": 2500 → 4100 ATK). Roa Sets a card. 
 "Royal Demon's Heavymetal" attacks "Sevens Road Magician", but Yuga activates his set Trap " Curtain of Sparks ", decreasing the attacking monster's ATK by 500 since he has a Spellcaster monster in his GY ("Royal Demon's Heavymetal": 4100 → 3600 ATK). The attack continues and "Sevens Road Magician" is destroyed (Yuga: 3400 → 500 LP).  
 Turn 6: Yuga Since Yuga has no cards in his hand, he draws five cards. Yuga Normal Summons " Mystic Dealer " (1000/0) and " Rescue Magician " (400/1300). Yuga activates the effect of "Rescue Magician", letting him send 1 Spell/Trap from his hand to the GY to return 1 Spellcaster monster from his GY to his hand. He sends " Dark Liberation " to the GY and returns "Sevens Road Magician" to his hand. He then tributes "Mystic Dealer" and "Rescue Magician" to Tribute Summon "Sevens Road Magician" (2100/1500). Since Yuga Normal Summoned a Level 7 or higher monster, Roa activates his Set Trap " King's Authority ", letting him target 1 monster Yuga controls and negate its effects until the End Phase. He targets "Sevens Road Magician". 
 Yuga Normal Summons " Sevens Road Mage " (800/800). Yuga activates the effect of "Sevens Road Mage", sending the top card of his Deck to the GY to decrease the ATK of 1 Level 7 or higher monster Roa controls by 400. Then, since he controls "Sevens Road Magician", the targeted monster also loses 100 ATK for every Spellcaster monster in Yuga's GY. He targets "Royal Demon's Heavymetal" ("Royal Demon's Heavymetal": 2500 → 2100 → 1100 ATK). "Sevens Road Magician" attacks and destroys "Royal Demon's Heavymetal" (Roa: 1500 → 500 LP). "Sevens Road Mage" attacks directly (Roa: 500 → 0 LP).
