 Miho Nosaka  is a major character in the  Toei  Yu-Gi-Oh!  anime  and  Yu-Gi-Oh! (1999 flim) .
 Miho appeared once in the manga in a story in which  Hiroto Honda  bought her a  love jigsaw puzzle . In Toei's anime, she was made into a main character, alongside  Yugi Mutou ,  Anzu Mazaki ,  Hiroto Honda  and  Jonouchi . Her role and personality in the anime are significantly different from the manga, but in both Honda has a massive crush on Miho, and this lasts throughout the Toei series. Even though in the anime she is also in the episode about the jigsaw puzzle, her role in the story is minor and instead the story is about  Mayumi  buying the puzzle for Jonouchi.

 Appearance 
 Miho's usual outfit is the  Domino High School 's girls' uniform. She has lilac hair that is fixed in a ponytail and usually has a yellow ribbon on top. Miho is fair-skinned.
 
 Personality 
 Miho is cheerful and flirty, though she can also be a stubborn and resilient girl who nonetheless cares deeply for her friends' safety. She often refers to herself in the third-person. Miho shows signs of being a typical fangirl, squealing in delight at any given moment when an attractive male (mainly  Ryo Bakura ) walks past and becoming obsessed with new games and fads she seemingly had no prior interest in throughout the series. She claims that she wants to marry someone wealthy in the future, but in truth, much like  Honda , she is a romanticist at heart. Nevertheless, Miho can be naïve and at times a little dim-witted and oblivious to the feelings of those around her, much to Honda's dismay. However, it is hinted that Miho may be aware of Honda's crush on her, as she says things in front of Honda seemingly on purpose so he will volunteer to do things for her.
 
             
 Irrespective of her flighty personality, if someone hurts her friends she will get serious and come to their defense, as shown when she confronted  Warashibe  for giving Anzu, Honda and Jonouchi tainted water and making them sick.  Sometimes her personality even causes her to bumble her way to victory, such as when she single-handedly, albeit accidentally, defeated three of Seto Kaiba's professional mercenaries in a  game  of laser tag.
 
 Etymology 
 Her first name means "beautiful" and "grain".
 
 Biography 
 Miho is  Anzu Mazaki 's best friend and a close friend of  Yugi Mutou ,  Katsuya Jonouchi ,  Hiroto Honda  (who is madly in love with her) and  Ryo Bakura .
 Miho entered the classroom while Jonouchi was tormenting Yugi. She said that the cafeteria line was long, and she had had nothing for lunch, prompting Honda to volunteer to buy her lunch. [3] 
 
           Miho, Anzu and Honda working at  Burger World .     
 After school one day, Jonouchi and Yugi agreed to go to  Burger World  on the way home. Honda disagreed, as it would be against school rules. Miho enthusiastically said that she'd like to go, causing Honda to change his mind. Anzu tried to discourage them from going, by saying she'd heard bad things about the place and reminded them of the escaped convict,  Jiro the Jorogumo . Jonouchi noted how Anzu had been acting weird lately and not accompanying them on their way home from school over the last few days. He wondered if Anzu could be dating older men for pay. Miho, not wanting Anzu to live such a life, followed her home to try and "rescue" her; however, she found that Anzu was actually working at Burger World, but kept it a secret (because of part-time jobs being against school rules). Miho too got a job at Burger World, wanting the extra money to buy things. She accompanied Anzu on her way home after school the next day. Honda suspected Miho was also dating for pay and followed, resulting in him also getting a job (as he wanted to use the extra money to buy stuff for Miho). The three were followed home by Yugi and Jonouchi the next day. Two escaped convicts entered Burger World that day and one of them wound up taking Anzu hostage. Miho, Honda and Anzu quit after this incident. Honda and Miho, however, got a new job at a noodle shop. [4] 
 Miho was invited to  Seto Kaiba 's mansion, along with the rest of Yugi's friends. She immediately grew fond of Kaiba because of his wealth, making Honda jealous. [5] 
 Honda was convinced by Miho to get up early to wait in line to buy a D-Shock watch for her. However, the watch got stolen by  Shotaro Akaboshi  while Honda wasn't paying attention. At the arcade, when Miho arrived to collect the watch, Honda discovered that it was missing and stripped down to his underwear while searching his clothes for it; as a result, Miho slapped him and ran off crying.  Dark Yugi  won the watch back in a  Shadow Game  and returned it to Honda, who passed it on to Miho. Two days later, Honda offered to wait in line to buy Miho some perfume. She was delighted to receive more gifts from Honda. [6] 
 
           Honda offers to train Miho's Digital Pet.     
 Miho got a  Digital Pet  and hoped to win the prize holiday in an upcoming tournament. However, she didn't want to spend time training the pet for the tournament herself, so she made sure to say this in front of Honda, who volunteered to take care of the pet. Honda took 3 days off school and returned with the pet, now named  Super Strawberry , which he used to defeat  Kujirada 's pet  Devil Master , who was busy eating Anzu and Jonouchi's pets.  Haiyama , who had been manipulating Kujirada, kidnapped Miho and left a note for Honda to find. Honda attempted to rescue Miho, but was whipped into unconsciousness by Haiyama, who intended to have him replace Kujirada as his "pet". While he was unconscious, Dark Yugi defeated Haiyama in a Shadow Game. As Miho lay unconscious on Honda, she spoke about going on the holiday, but with her mother rather than Honda. [7] 
 Mayumi  had a crush on Jonouchi. Looking for ideas in what gift to get him, she asked Miho and Anzu what Jonouchi was interested in. Miho said porn videos, but after realizing that Mayumi was looking for a gift, they got Yugi to help and ended up getting a jigsaw love letter. [8] 
 
           Miho faces  Warashibe  in a game of  Capsule Monster Chess .     
 The college student  Warashibe  desperately tried to win Miho's affection by sending her  Capsule Monster Chess  pieces as presents. Warashibe pretended to be a hero in front of Miho by saving her from a thug, who was really Yugi in disguise. However, Miho recognized Yugi and Warashibe's appearance, which didn't meet her expectations. Warashibe tried to invite Miho to his secret base, but she refused and slapped him after getting too creeped out. Embarrassed by what happened, Warashibe poisoned Miho's friends with tainted water, prompting her to confront him. Yugi led her to Warashibe's base, where she was forced into a game of Capsule Monster Chess. Upon realizing that Warashibe had rigged the  dispenser  to give Miho incredibly weak monsters, Miho angrily got up to leave. Warashibe refused to let them leave, as he wanted to put Miho in a giant CapMon capsule. He quickly closed his gate, which broke, causing a part of it to hit Miho and Yugi, knocking them out. Yugi then transformed into Dark Yugi and defeated Warashibe, subjecting him to a  Penalty Game  and rescuing Miho. [9] 
 When Yugi and Anzu went to  Domino Park  together, Miho, Jonouchi and Honda investigated to see if it was actually a date. Miho lashed out at Honda after he suggested that they go to the pool so he could see her in a swimsuit. Regardless, she still spent time with Honda in the pool. She managed to get out of the park during the evacuation when there was a bomb scare, but returned after the  bomber  was captured. [10] 
 Miho congratulated Yugi after he received a love letter from  Risa Kageyama  and asked Anzu if she felt jealous. She continued to spy on Yugi's love life, by hiding in the bushes with the rest of his friends to watch Yugi meeting Risa. [11] 
 
           Miho in the mermaid costume.     
 Honda tried talking Miho into taking part in a beauty pageant. After Miho fell for Bakura, she agreed to do it. Fellow contestant  Kaoruko Himekoji  and her supporter, the  Student Council Chairman , tried to sabotage Miho's chances of winning. Miho performed  majorette  dancing in the first round. The chairman had her swimsuit torn-up for the next round, but Miho improvised and wore a mermaid costume from the school drama supplies. Before the final round, Kaoruko knocked Miho unconscious and tore her dress. Dark Yugi then defeated Kaoruko in a Shadow Game, causing her to withdraw from the competition as well. [12] 
 Miho also helps out her friends during the  Death-T  and the  Monster World  arcs.
 In  Yu-Gi-Oh! (1999 flim) , she hung out with her friends at school and had a good time with them. Miho, Honda, Yugi and Jonouchi head to a  card shop  to watch Yugi and Jonouchi play a game of  Duel Monsters . Much to the gang's shock, they discovered that Anzu now worked there. Miho watched Yugi play the game as he explained it to her. Honda challenged her, but she wanted to watch some more.  Shougo Aoyama  was being picked on because he could not play the game very well. Anzu explained that the child had been there before, but was too timid to play.
 Miho's final appearance was her having a good time with her friends and  Shougo .
 
 Deck 
 Miho Dueled Yugi once, but none of her cards were shown.
 
 Relationships 
 Anzu Mazaki 
 Miho and Anzu are best friends. They support each other and rarely fight. Miho likes to tease her when Yugi is with or shows interest in another girl. Despite that, both girls are often together.
 
 Ryo Bakura 
 Miho Nosaka has a crush on  Ryo Bakura . When she first met him, she intended on inviting him to her school. Miho strongly defends Bakura, even going to the point of saying unrealistic things about him. Even though Bakura is Miho's love interest, she may be aware of Honda's feelings for her despite her specious naïveté.
