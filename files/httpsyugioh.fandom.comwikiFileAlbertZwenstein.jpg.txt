 Dr. Eisenstein , known in Japan as  Dr. Allbert Zweinstein , is a ten time Nobel award-winning German physicist, specialized in Duel physics, with an IQ of 173.  He is most famous for his quantum duel theory.
 Eisenstein arrives at  Duel Academy  under  Prince Ojin 's request and is sent by  Sartorius  to eliminate  Jaden  and retrieve his key to the mind control satellite although his underestimation of the young  Duelist 's tactics results in his failure.  Bastion  idolizes him for his unified theory of the world constituting a "beautiful space" and calls him a "god". 
 He returns during the third year to communicate with those trapped in the other world, informing them that the key to their escape is to send  Jesse's  " Rainbow Dragon " card through a wormhole to link both dimensions.
 His last name, in both the English and Japanese versions of the anime, is a pun on the name of  Albert Einstein  and as such is based on him in voice, therefore he speaks with a German accent. Jaden continuously mispronounces his name, in a parody of "The Young Frankenstein".

 Deck 
 Eisenstein plays a  Relativity Deck . Being a Duel physicist, Eisenstein has researched extensively the interactions between  Monster ,  Spell , and  Trap Cards , coming to the conclusion that science overtakes any sort of "miracle" or "luck". He occasionally quotes Albert Einstein's assertion that "God does not roll dice", meaning that the universe is not ruled by chance. As such, his Deck exploits statistics and probability, yet in doing so, ignores alternative methods of achieving identical results as with Jaden's use of  Contact Fusion . References to Einstein's interests are made throughout his Deck, including mentions of " Pierre-Simon Laplace " and  Schrödinger's cat .
