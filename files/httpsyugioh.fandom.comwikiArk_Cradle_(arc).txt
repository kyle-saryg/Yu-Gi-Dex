 Ark Cradle  is the fifth and final arc of the  Yu-Gi-Oh! 5D's  anime. This arc takes place after the final match of the  World Racing Grand Prix , after  Team 5D's  won the final match against  Team New World . It was believed that doing so would stop the  Divine Temple  (Ark Cradle in the Japanese version) from colliding with  New Domino City . However, that match also completed the  Grand Design  and thus the Temple appeared. The arc itself focuses on Team 5D's infiltration of the structure to stop  Z-one 's plans. It also includes the final time skip in which the members of Team 5D's must decide whether they should stay together in the city, or leave the city to follow their goals, but having to be separated.
 In the English version, only 131-136 were dubbed, furthermore the dubbed version series ended in  episode 136  (The dub version of the episode had the rest of Aporia's duel from the beginning of episode  137 , as well as the part where Team 5D's celebrated their victory. Also during the end of the episode when Aporia lost, the Divine Temple disappeared from existence entirely, and ends with Yusei saying the future and present are now safe).
