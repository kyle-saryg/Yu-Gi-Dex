 " Phantom Knights ", known as " Phantom " (ファントム  Fantomu ) in Japan, is an  archetype  used by  Yuto  in  Yu-Gi-Oh! ARC-V . It contains one sub-archetype, " The Phantom Knights ". 
 Due to their Japanese names, a number of unrelated cards, such as " Grass Phantom " and " Odd-Eyes Phantom Dragon ", also fall into this archetype. However, because  OCG  support for this archetype only works on  Spell  and  Trap Cards , this is not an issue.
