 Summary 
   This summary is currently incomplete. 
 Yuya  and  Reiji  had vanished off the grid following their duel two weeks ago, with  Shingo  and  Shun  searching for their leader when they run into  Yuzu  who has been looking for Yuya. After Shingo tells Yuzu that he heard some kids talking about strange noises from a manhole in the south district of Maiami City, he and Kurosaki decide to break into the now abandoned Leo Corp building and use its computer to locate Reiji and Yuya.
 Yuzu reaches the manhole Shingo mentioned, going into the sewer to find Yuya on a Duel Runner. Yuya explains to Yuzu that he spent the last two weeks training uninterrupted in the underground waterway to get stronger to face his enemies, though Yuzu is curious why Yuya is doing it on his own instead of getting help from  Yuto . Within Yuya's mind, revealed to be the one training Yuya to use a Duel Runner,  Yugo  is confronted by Yuto and  Yuri  over why he is pushing Yuya. Yugo explains his reasons to be the assumption Yuri had made: That the awaken  Adam Factor  with Yuya is gradually disrupting their link to Yuya. Thus Yugo intends to teach Yuya his skills in case he ends dueling on his without them to back him up.
 Elsewhere, as  Ren  heads out once he and  Sora  pinpointed Yuya's location at a particle accelerator,  Eve  is attended by her doctor  Isaac  as she is revealed to be ill and needs the power of  Genesis Omega Dragon  to both restore her memories of her former self, alongside Ren and Sora's, along with granting herself and her followers immortality.
