 Biography 
 After defeating some kids,  Yuma  gets cheered up, but  Astral  tells him he is only able to win due to his help, and that he relies on  monsters  too much. Yuma says that intensely attacking with monsters is more interesting and that he can win without Astral's help. Tokunosuke hears what Yuma says about his strategy and goes to  Team ZEXAL  to tell them that he doesn't have any friends, so he doesn't really have anyone he could  Duel  with. Hearing that, Yuma Duels Tokunosuke. During the Duel, Yuma plays very recklessly, falling into Tokunosuke's tricks, although Astral kept warning him about them. However, Astral eventually backs Yuma up, and he manages to win.
 After Tokunosuke loses to Yuma, he explains that he wanted to enter a certain  Dueling Team , and that he would only be accepted if he defeated the leader of the ZEXAL Team, Yuma. Then, the leader of the  Team , a boy nicknamed  Shark , shows up. Tokunosuke rushes up, but he is despised by Shark's Team. Yuma gets angry with that, and confronts Shark. [2]  Shark calls Team ZEXAL weak, and challenges Yuma to a Duel under some conditions: first, they will bet their teams' badges, which symbolizes the pride of the team; and second, if Yuma lose, Tokunosuke will enter Shark's team as a slave who does every work. With no other option, Yuma accepts the Duel. [3]
