 Description 
 It is said that the people who have become Deleted are those who went to LINK VRAINS and never returned, choosing to live there instead.  Naoki Shima  speculates that it is due to a cursed  Duel Disk , where upon midnight white hands come out and drag the Duel Disk's owner into LINK VRAINS. However, the truth about this rumor is that the victims were forcefully logged into LINK VRAINS. There, they are confronted by  Dr. Genome , who is looking for  Playmaker .
 Because the Knights' target is Playmaker, all victims of the Deleted phenomenon except for  Skye Zaizen  have three things in common: exceptional  Dueling  talent, ownership and use of an old-type Duel Disk, and the fact that all of them are hackers.
 After Dr. Genome's defeat, other victims of the Deleted phenomenon are predominantly a result of attacks from rogue members of the Knights who indiscriminately target any  Duelist  that so much as logs into the LINK VRAINS. However, as these Knights do not carry the cure and the constant updating of the virus makes it impossible to create a removal program; the only way to help the rest of the victims is to defeat the virus's creator.
