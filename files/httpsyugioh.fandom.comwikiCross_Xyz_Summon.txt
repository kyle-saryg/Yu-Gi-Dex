 Cross Xyz Summon
 
 
 A  Cross Xyz Summon  (クロスエクシーズ,  Kurosu Ekushīzu Shōkan ) is a method of  Xyz Summoning  an  Xyz Monster  using at least 1 non-Xyz Monster and 1 Xyz Monster whose  Level  and  Rank  have the same value. For example, a Level 4 monster and a Rank 4 monster could be used as  Xyz Materials  in a Cross Xyz Summon. This type of Summon was first performed by  Shay Obsidian  in the  Yu-Gi-Oh! ARC-V  anime. [1] 
 Presently in the anime, the only way to perform a Cross Xyz Summon is by the effect of " Cross Xyz ".
 This is in some ways similar to the effect and Summoning of " Odd-Eyes Rebellion Dragon " and " Odd-Eyes Raging Dragon " by  Yuya Sakaki  in the  Yu-Gi-Oh! ARC-V  anime. In the anime, both require 2  Level  7  Dragon - Type  monsters (not Xyz Monsters) as  Material , but they require using an Xyz Monster as an Xyz Material in order to  activate  their  effects . Yuya accomplishes the requirements by using the  Pendulum Effects  of " Xiangke Magician " and " Xiangsheng Magician ", or the  Spell Card  " The Phantom Knights' Possession ", to give " Dark Rebellion Xyz Dragon " a Level and then equalize it with that of " Odd-Eyes Pendulum Dragon " in order to  overlay  both dragons. [2] [3]
