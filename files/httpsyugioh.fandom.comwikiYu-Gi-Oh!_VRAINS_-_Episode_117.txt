 After finding out where  Ai  is,  Yusaku  heads to an island located in the outskirts of  Den City , all by himself. Ai has already started making copies of himself on the island, using the  SOLtiS  he acquired from  SOL Technologies . Ai reveals his motive for attacking humans, as well as all the thoughts he's been keeping to himself. And now, with the future of the world on the line, Yusaku and Ai begin their first and final battle.
 
 Featured Duel: Playmaker vs. Ai 
         
 The Duel is conducted as a  Master Duel .
 Turn 1: Playmaker 
 Playmaker   Normal Summons  " Garbage Collector " (100/1900). He then activates the  Continuous Spell  " Cynet Optimization ", letting him Normal Summon 1  Cyberse  Monster during his Main Phase. He Normal Summons " Flame Bufferlo " (1400/200). Playmaker then activates the effect of "Garbage Collector", letting him return 1 other Cyberse monster he controls to the hand to  Special Summon  a Cyberse monster from his Deck with the same  Level  but a different  Attribute . He returns "Flame Bufferlo" to the hand and Special Summons " Sea Archiver " (300/2100) from his Deck in  Defense Position . Since "Flame Bufferlo" left the field, its effect lets Playmaker  discard  a Cyberse monster to draw two cards (although not shown it was later revealed to be " Clock Wyvern " during during part two of the duel). He uses "Garbage Collector" and the  WATER  "Sea Archiver" to  Link Summon  " Splash Mage " (1100/LINK-2/↗↘). Playmaker activates the effect of "Splash Mage", letting him Special Summon 1 Cyberse monster from his  GY  in Defense Position once per turn. He Special Summons "Sea Archiver", then uses it and "Splash Mage" to Link Summon " Decode Talker " (2300/LINK-3/↙↑↘) to the  Extra Monster Zone . Playmaker sets a card.
 Turn 2: Ai Ai Normal Summons " Pikari @Ignister " (1200/600). As it was Summoned, its effect lets Ai add " Ignister A.I.Land " from his Deck to his hand. Ai then uses "Pikari" to Link Summon " Linguriboh " (300/LINK-1/↙) to the Extra Monster Zone. Ai activates the Field Spell "Ignister A.I.Land". As he controls no monsters in his Main Monster Zones, the effect of "AiLand" lets him Special Summon 1 Level 4 or lower "@Ignister" monster from his hand, but he can only Special Summon Cyberse monsters for the rest of the turn. Ai Special Summons " Doyon @Ignister " (400/1600). As it was Summoned, the effect of "Doyon" lets Ai add 1 "@Ignister" monster from his GY to his hand. Ai adds "Pikari". Ai then activates the Continuous Spell " CompromA.I.se ", allowing him to once per turn place 1 " @Ignister " monster he controls in his  Spell & Trap Zone  as a Continuous Spell. He targets "Doyon". As he controls no monsters in his Main Monster Zones, Ai activates the effect of "AiLand" again to Special Summon "Pikari" from his hand. As it was Summoned, its effect lets Ai add another copy of "AiLand" from his Deck to his hand. As a monster was Special Summoned, the other effect of "CompromA.I.se" lets Ai Special Summon 1 "@Ignister" monster from his Spell & Trap Zone. He Special Summons "Doyon" then uses it, "Pikari" and the  DARK  "Linguriboh" to Link Summon " Dark Templar @Ignister " (2300/LINK-3/↙↓↘). As he controls no monsters in his Main Monster Zones, Ai activates the effect of "AiLand" again to Special Summon " Achichi @Ignister " (800/800) in Defense Position to a zone "Dark Templar" points to. As a monster was summoned to a zone his Link Monster points to, the effect of "Dark Templar" lets Ai Special Summon as many Level 4 or lower "@Ignister" monsters as possible with different names from his GY to zones his Link Monster points to. Ai targets "Dark Templar" and Special Summons "Pikari" and "Doyon" to the remaining zones it points to. He then uses "Pikari", "Doyon" and the  FIRE  "Achichi" to Link Summon " Fire Phoenix @Ignister " (2300/LINK-3/←↓→) to a zone "Dark Templar" points to. Ai activates the  Link Spell  " Judgment Arrows " (↖↑↗) in the Spell/Trap Zone the bottom Link Arrow of "Fire Phoenix" points to. 
 "Fire Phoenix" attacks "Decode Talker", but Playmaker activates his set Continuous Trap " Code Hack ". While "Code Hack" is face-up, " Code Talker " monsters cannot be destroyed by card effects. The attack continues but since a "Code Talker" monster he controls is battling, Playmaker activates the other effect of "Code Hack" to reduce the ATK of the monster it battles to 0 until the end of the  Battle Phase  ("Fire Phoenix": 2300 → 0 ATK), prevent both monsters from being destroyed by battle and reduce all  Battle Damage  any player takes to 0. The attack fails and neither monster is destroyed. "Dark Templar" attacks "Decode Talker", and since the effect of "Dark Templar" prevents it from being destroyed by battle with a monster that has the same ATK, only "Decode Talker" is destroyed. At the end of the Battle Phase, the effect of "Code Hack" ends, so the ATK of "Fire Phoenix" returns to normal ("Fire Phoenix": 0 → 2300 ATK). Ai sets a card. 
 Duel continues in the next episode . 
 
 Errors 
 In the English Dub, when Playmaker activates the effect of "Flame Bufferlo" on his first turn, the Japanese version of "Garbage Collector" can be seen on his duel disk instead of the international one.
