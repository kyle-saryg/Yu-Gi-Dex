 Duel 1: Yuma Tsukumo vs. Alpha 
 Turn 1: Alpha 
 Alpha 's starting  hand  contains " Mecha Phantom Beast Tetherwolf ", " Mecha Phantom Beast Blackfalcon ", " Mecha Phantom Beast Megaraptor ", " Mecha Phantom Beast Stealthray " and " Mecha Phantom Beast Hamstrat ". He  draws  " Windrose the Elemental Lord ". Alpha  Normal Summons  "Tetherwolf" (1700/1200), with its  effect   Special Summoning  1 " Mecha Phantom Beast Token " (0/0) in  Defense Position . 
 Turn 2: Yuma 
 Yuma 's starting hand contains " Gagaga Magician ", " Dododo Warrior ", " Gagagawind ", " Gagagarevenge " and " Bottomless Trap Hole ". He draws " Mimimic ". Yuma Normal Summons "Gagaga Magician" (1500/1000), and  activates  its effect, changing its  Level  to 3. Since Alpha  controls  a  monster  and he controls a Level 3 monster, Yuma Special Summons "Mimimic" (300/300) from his hand. He  Overlays  his two Level 3 monsters to  Xyz Summon  " Muzurhythm the String Djinn " (1500/1000) in Attack Position. Yuma  attacks  "Tetherwolf" with "Muzurythm", using its effect to  detach  an  Xyz Material  in order to double its  ATK  until the  End Phase  ("Muzurhythm": 1500 → 3000). Since Alpha controls a "Mecha Phantom Beast Token", "Tetherwolf" is not  destroyed  (Alpha 4000 → 2700). Yuma  Sets  a card.
 Turn 3: Alpha 
Alpha Normal Summons "Blackfalcon" (1200/1700). He attacks "Muzurythm" with "Tetherwolf", using its effect to  Tribute  his "Mecha Phantom Beast Token" in order to increase its ATK by 800 (1700/1200 → 2500/1200). Muzurythm is destroyed (Yuma 4000 → 3000). Alpha then attacks Yuma  directly  with "Blackfalcon" (Yuma 3000 → 1800), with the effect of "Blackfalcon" Special Summoning a "Mecha Phantom Beast Token" upon attack declaration (0/0). The Levels of "Tetherwolf" and "Blackfalcon" are increased by the token's Level, so they both become Level 7. Alpha Overlays his two Level 7 monsters to Xyz Summon " Mecha Phantom Beast Dracossack " (2600/2200) in Attack Position. Alpha activates its first effect to detach an Xyz Material in order to Special Summon two more "Mecha Phantom Beast Tokens" (0/0 each), then activates its other effect to Tribute one of them in order to destroy a card on the field. He destroys Yuma's Set "Bottomless Trap Hole".
 Turn 4: Yuma 
Yuma Normal Summons " Dododo Warrior " (2300/900) without Tributing via its own effect, which reduces its  original ATK  to 1800. He then activates "Gagagarevenge", Special Summoning "Gagaga Magician" from his  Graveyard . Yuma then activates the effect of "Gagaga Magician" to change its Level to 6, and Overlays his two Level 6 monsters to Xyz Summon " Gauntlet Launcher " (2400/2800) in Attack Position. The effect of "Gagagarevenge" increases the ATK of "Gauntlet Launcher" by 300 (2400/2800 → 2700/2800). Yuma activates the effect of "Gauntlet Launcher" twice, detaching its two Xyz Materials in order to destroy both of Alpha's "Mecha Phantom Beast Tokens". He then  equips  "Gauntlet Launcher" with " Xyz Unit ", and activates its effect again, using "Xyz Unit" as its Xyz Material, to destroy "Dracossack". Yuma attacks Alpha directly with "Gauntlet Launcher" (Alpha 2700 → 0).
