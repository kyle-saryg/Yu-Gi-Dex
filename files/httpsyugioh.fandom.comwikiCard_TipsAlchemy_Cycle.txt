 This card can be searched by " A Cat of Ill Omen ", " Trap Trick " and " Lilith, Lady of Lament ". 
 This card is best used when your opponent attacks while all monsters you control are face-up  Defense Position  monsters with non-zero ATK that are not  Tokens  or  Pendulum Monsters , and  float  when destroyed. That way, you are guaranteed to regain card advantage when one of your monsters are destroyed.
 If they are face-down or in  Attack Position , chain " Desert Sunlight " to force them to face-up Defense Position. 
 If they cannot be changed to Defense Position due to " Final Attack Orders " or being  Link Monsters , ensure you have " Spirit Barrier " or " Rainbow Life " ready so that you take no damage. 
 When your opponent attacks a monster that  inflicts battle damage to them  regardless of the matchup (such as " Amazoness Swords Woman ", " Daigusto Sphreez ", etc.), activate this card to inflict more damage to them and draw a card at the end of the battle. 
 If you control " Zerozerock ", activating this card will stop your opponent from attacking Attack Position monsters that turn, while potentially allowing your Defense Position monsters to float via this card's effect.
