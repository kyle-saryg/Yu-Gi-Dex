 " A Duel of Thrones ", known in Japan as " The One Who Is a Throne " is the nineteenth episode of the  Yu-Gi-Oh! SEVENS  anime. It aired in Japan on October 10, 2020.
 A massage chair showed up out of nowhere in front of the  Road Laboratory ! As  Yuga  and co. were trying the chair out and having a nice massage, they were suddenly sent underground. A massage chair drone named  Sebastian  then emerged from the darkness, proclaiming itself as  Nail 's butler and throne. Thus began the Duel between Yuga and the "King of Chairs"!
 
 Featured Duel: Yuga Ohdo vs. Sebastian 
 The Duel is conducted as a  Rush Duel .
 Turn 1: Sebastian 
Sebastian Normal Summons " Dwell Chair Gear " (0/1200), " Dwell Chair Bone " (0/0) and " Dwell Chair Saber " (0/1400). He sets 2 cards.
 Turn 2: Yuga 
Yuga Normal Summons " Dark Sorcerer " (1500/0), " Light Sorcerer " (1500/0) and " Kuribot " (300/200), then tributes "Kuribot" to Tribute Summon " Windcaster Torna " (1600/1000). Yuga sets a card. "Torna" attacks and destroys "Saber" (Sebastian: 4000 → 2400 LP). Since a  DARK  monster with 0 ATK was destroyed, Sebastian activates his set Trap " Collapse Chair ", destroying all Level 8 or lower Attack Position monsters on the field, then sending cards from the top of both players Decks to the GY equal to the number of monsters destroyed. Five monsters were destroyed, so both players send 5 cards from their Deck to the GY.
 Turn 3: Sebastian 
Since Sebastian has no cards in his hand, he draws five cards. Sebastian sets a card. Sebastian Normal Summons "Dwell Chair Gear" and "Dwell Chair Bone", then tributes both to Tribute Summon " Throne of Darkness " (0/2500). Since he has 8 or more monsters in his GY with 0 ATK, the effect of "Throne of Darkness" lets Sebastian Special Summon 1 Level 7 or higher monster from his hand with 0 ATK. He Special Summons " Dayu the Dark King of Chairs " (0/2400). Sebastian activates the effect of "Dayu", sending the top card of his Deck to the GY to target 1 other face-up monster he controls with 0 ATK and have "Dayu" gain ATK equal to its Level x 500 until the end of the turn. He targets "Throne of Darkness" ("Dayu": 0 → 4000 ATK). "Dayu" attacks Yuga directly, but Yuga activates his set Trap " Curtain of Sparks ", decreasing the attacking monster's ATK by 500 since he has a Spellcaster monster in his GY ("Dayu": 4000 → 3500 ATK). The direct attack continues (Yuga: 4000 → 500 LP). 
 Turn 4: Yuga 
Since Yuga has no cards in his hand, he draws five cards. Yuga Normal Summons " Child of Wind, Cyc " (400/600) and " Stray Familiar " (0/1400), then tributes them to Tribute Summon " Sevens Road Magician " (2100/1500). Since Yuga summoned a Level 5 or higher monster, Sebastian activates his set Trap " Power of Throne ", returning 1 face-up monster he controls with 0 ATK to his hand to have Yuga draw cards equal to the returned monster's Level. Also, for the rest of the turn Yuga cannot attack monsters on the field with 0 ATK. He returns "Dayu" to his hand and Yuga draws 7 cards. Since Yuga drew cards while he controls a monster with 0 ATK, Sebastian activates his set Trap " Gate of Thrones ", letting him return 1 monster Yuga controls to his hand and then have Yuga pick one random card in his hand. If he picks the returned monster, it will be Special Summoned but if he picks anything else he takes 1000 damage (This is visualized by Yuga's cards turning into copies of  Kaizo  and forcing him to find the real one). 
 Yuga picks "Sevens Road Magician", so it is Special Summoned back to his field. Since he controls a Level 7 or higher Spellcaster monster, Yuga activates " Road Magic - Backflow ", letting him send 1  WATER  monster from his hand to the GY to return 1 monster Sebastian controls to his hand. He sends " Hydro Magician " to the GY and returns "Throne of Darkness" to Sebastian's hand. Yuga activates the effect of "Sevens Road Magician", sending the top card of his Deck to the GY to increase the ATK of "Sevens Road Magician" by 300 for each different Attribute in his GY until the End Phase ("Sevens Road Magician": 2100 → 3900 ATK). "Sevens Road Magician" attacks Sebastian directly (Sebastian: 2400 → 0 LP).
