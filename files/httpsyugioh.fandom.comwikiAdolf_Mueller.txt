 Biography 
 History 
 Not much is known about Adolf's past, other than he apparently suffered an embarrassing loss to  Jack Atlas  on his path to become King. [2] 
 
 Yu-Gi-Oh! 5D's 
 Adolf was present at the D1 Grand Prix opening ceremonies where he watched  Rex Goodwin 's introduction to the tournament. When Rex mentioned the contestants had to break through a wall to win, Adolf questions what he meant, shortly before Jack bursts into the stadium. [2] 
 Although Adolf's  Duels  weren't shown, he made it to the tournament finals and was shown on the cruise travelling to  Saiko Island  for the finals. When  Lazar  explains the  Duel Zodiac , Adolf questions whether a Duelist can use a  Star Ticket  value of more than 12 to enter the finals, which Lazar informs him that he can't. [1]  He was later shown to have obtained the Level 3 Star Ticket by defeating  Tiger Eyes , but he lost it to  Admire Derby . [3] .
 Lazar reveals to  Andre  that he defeated Adolf and sealed his soul within a " Soul Prison " card. [4]
