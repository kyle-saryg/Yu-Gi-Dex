 "Nobleman-Eater Bug" is the adult form of " Man-Eater Bug ", with double the effect,  ATK  and  DEF . 
 The Japanese name, "使徒食い虫" (しとくいムシ), is a pun on "人食い虫" (ひとくいムシ), the Japanese name of the original Man-Eater Bug. Coincidentally, 使徒 (shito) was previously translated in English as "Nobleman," as per the cards  Nobleman of Extermination  and  Nobleman of Crossout , so the pun translates almost perfectly. 
 This monster bears a resemblance to one of the Blues, the monstrous insects from the anime  Blue Gender
