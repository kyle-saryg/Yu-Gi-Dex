 This is based on the General/Basic builds of each deck. 
 Also taking into account of the cards run in those decks  (e.g. Gadgets run lots of  Fissures  and  Smashing Grounds , so Thunder King Rai-Oh will not Cripple the deck) (e.g. Glads have tricks such as the Book of Moon trick against Skill Drain). However, this does not take into account of the opponent's Side Decks (e.g. ignores 3  Dust Tornados  in their Side Deck). 
 Ignoring  Staples  as they are not  Side Deck  material. 
 If anyone would like to add (e.g. cards or top tier decks) or change things (e.g. move cards from cripple to works against) please post the ideas below.

 New Decktype 
 Maybe we should add a new deck to the decklist: the one that revolves around  Reborn Tengu . A good number of Tengu decks made it to the Top 32 in the previous Orlando tournament. Maybe a couple of cards that can be sided-in against them are  Archlord Kristya  and  Royal Oppression , since Tengu decks seem to rely a lot on Special Summoning.
 Moja619  ( talk  •  contribs ) 17:39, June 7, 2011 (UTC)
 
 Vanity's Fiend  used in Frog decks. 
 Debunk 
 and you  could  abuse the fact that  Reborn Tengu  is a  Mandatory  Trigger. Would be nice if there was some combo that lets you attack all of them continuously and OTK them.... or vice versa, like a Strong monster +  Battle Mania .  - Falzar FZ - ( talk page | useful stuff )  02:04, June 8, 2011 (UTC) 
 
can i ask what cards is best to side against twilight deck ? if i'm not wrong i has not see on the the list  Gemini 93  ( talk  •  contribs ) 02:39, June 9, 2011 (UTC)
 
 First two that come to mind are  Chaos Trap Hole ,  Koa'ki Meiru Drago  (kinda); 
 other anti Special Summoned cards, other anti Lightsworn cards (depending on the type of Twilight deck).  - Falzar FZ - ( talk page | useful stuff )  02:37, June 10, 2011 (UTC) 
 Well if you are running a simple deck, i would say light and shadow imprisonment Mirror, especially when the foe is using  a  lightsworn dragon -- MSBlinga  ( talk  •  contribs ) 21:28, March 19, 2015 (UTC) 
 Prohibition against Monarchs and Frogs = Win. BobaFett2  ( talk) 
 What is the best monster to declare? 
 added Chain Disappearance against Formula Synchron spammers 
 Rivalry of Warlords against Monarchs (before, if you only control 1 monster, you can Tribute 1 Type for another Type in a Tribute Summon; now you cannot.) 
 Added section on Dark World. 
 - Falzar FZ - ( talk page | useful stuff )  11:57, July 11, 2011 (UTC) 
 How come  Tengu   Synchro  still doesn't appear in the Deck list above? It's pretty much dominating the major tournaments since Tengu's release    Moja619  ( talk  •  contribs ) 21:06, July 11, 2011 (UTC)
 
 It's being discussed, (under the heading "New Decktype"; just a few lines above). 
 I'm not sure if it's worth starting a new section for them, or add it to the plants section. 
 Any suggestions on the cards apart from the ones in the plants section and the 2 mentioned above?  - Falzar FZ - ( talk page | useful stuff )  01:57, July 12, 2011 (UTC) 
 Yeah, i see your point. plant synchro is quite similar to Tengu synchro outside of tengu itself. i don't know if the negation effects of cards like  Solemn Warning ,  Thunder King Rai-Oh  and  Black Horn of Heaven  used on a  Special Summoned  tengu will prevent it from using its effect.    Moja619  ( talk  •  contribs ) 02:03, July 13, 2011 (UTC)
 
 Thunder King Rai-Oh / Black Horn of Heaven  (Summon negation) cards don't work against Special Summons that occur during resolution of an effect.  - Falzar FZ - ( talk page | useful stuff )  02:44, July 13, 2011 (UTC) 
 Modern Built 
 Gladiator Beasts:  Solemn Warning 
 Gladiator Beasts:  Dimensional Prison 
 Warning is definitely a Main Deck card. 
 Dragons: Different Dimension Ground  won't do anything if chained to  Trade-In  since discarding a monster is a  cost .  207.233.120.2  ( talk ) 21:18, August 4, 2011 (UTC) 
 Most people maindeck both already. BobaFett2  ( talk) 
 
 Solemn Warning's a  Staple , Dimensional Prison is already listed there. 
 Was intended to prevent Trade-In from being activated that turn by activating it before hand, like in the Standby Phase, but I guess there's little point in that and you don't know when the opponent would have it, removed Trade-In from the list.  - Falzar FZ - ( talk page | useful stuff )  01:41, August 5, 2011 (UTC)
 I think they're already  Staples , and are thus not  Side Deck  Material. 
 Designless Square  ( talk  •  contribs ) 20:32, August 12, 2011 (UTC)
 
 Stuff 
 In the references to  Necrovalley , both  Gigaplant  and  REDMD  are noted to "not Target". That is no longer an issue. I find it ironic that there's a warning to get  Royal Oppression  out before  Herald of Perfection  comes out, but nothing like that in the  6S  section. 
 Also, you listed  Ally Salvo  as a counter to  Celestia  and  JD . Prolly dittography. 
 By the way, does  Dimensional Fissure  hurt  Gravekeeper's ?  207.233.120.2  ( talk ) 21:18, August 4, 2011 (UTC)
 
 Fixed, thanks. 
 Removed; was probably thinking of something else. 
 Not really... I don't think so...  - Falzar FZ - ( talk page | useful stuff )  01:41, August 5, 2011 (UTC) 
 Allies of Justice 
 Ally of Justice Cycle Reader  is awesome against Lightsworns and Agents-it's a double D.D. Crow and it's a Level 3 Tuner monster if you want to use it in a Synchro Summon.  Ally of Justice Core Destroyer  is a Catastor when you're dueling Agents and Lightsworns that you can summon at no cost. BobaFett2  ( talk) 
 
 "Cycle Reader" is a great Side, particularly against  Fabled . "Core Destroyer" is OK, but  Agents  can Synchro around it or bomb it with " Hyperion ". Lightsworns have a bit of trouble unless they're the  Chaos  variant (they usually are). 'Least it kills "Wulf".
 On an unrelated note, " Chain Disappearance " only works against " Infernity Mirage " in the OCG. 
 Designless Square  ( talk  •  contribs ) 20:24, August 12, 2011 (UTC)
 
 Can you explain? I don't see why it can't be used on  Infernity Necromancer  in the  OCG TCG...  - Falzar FZ - ( talk page | useful stuff )  22:54, September 26, 2011 (UTC) 
 Cards to side against Agents need to be added, as they are now the top deck of the format. I recommend  Thunder King Rai-Oh  (stops Earth, negates Hyperion/Kristya/BLS if they run it, Sangan if they run BLS),  Light-Imprisoning Mirror  (stops everything),  Leeching the Light , (gain major ATK for game, was popular at the last YCS),  Dimensional Fissure / Macro Cosmos  (nothing in grave, no fuel for Hyperion, nothing to drop Kristya, nothing for BLS, Sangan doesn't search).  Lappyzard  ( talk  •  contribs ) 05:57, September 25, 2011 (UTC)
 Grave of the Super Ancient Organism  stops Hyperion, BLS, Kristya, and Trishula as well as the occasional Stardust.  Chain Disappearance  rids you of pesky Earths and Shine Balls.  BF2    Talk    Deck Guides  12:50, September 25, 2011 (UTC)
 I can't believe I forgot this: side  Zombie Master  against Zombies.  Paladin of Cursed Dragon  works as well although not necessarily as effectively. Of course,  Puppet Plant  works as well. Kycoo stops Book of Life if I'm not mistaken.  BF2    Talk    Deck Guides  23:01, September 26, 2011 (UTC)
 Ah.  Big Burn  against Infernities, or does that not work?  Ally of Justice Quarantine  isn't bad against Agents (Vulnerable only to Honest and Jupiter, and not even BLS).  BF2    Talk    Deck Guides  23:25, September 26, 2011 (UTC)
 Big Burn worked pre-Leviair, but now it might actually help them.  Lappyzard  ( talk  •  contribs ) 01:55, September 27, 2011 (UTC)
 Nah, it's as effective as ever-unless they have Tour Guide, they have no access to Leviair once their Necromancers are Banished.  BF2    Talk    Deck Guides  02:11, September 27, 2011 (UTC)
 And all good Infernity decks are running Tour Guide.  Lappyzard  ( talk  •  contribs ) 19:19, September 27, 2011 (UTC)
 
 I meant that they have to draw it, since they'll be topdecking.  BF2    Talk    Deck Guides  20:40, September 27, 2011 (UTC) 
 Definitely a counter. 
 I should have been clearer. " Infernity Mirage " cannot be stopped by " Chain Disappearance " in the TCG because it is no longer a valid target after the cost for its effect is carried out (with  Priority ). 
 " Zombie World " works all right against Agents. It stops Kristya, keeps Hyperion from bombing anything, blocks the effect of Jupiter, and crushes Sanctuary if they're using it (sillyheads). Doesn't stop Venus though. 
 Designless Square  ( talk  •  contribs ) 20:06, September 30, 2011 (UTC)
 
 Are you saying Big Burn is a counter?  BF2    Talk    Deck Guides  20:39, September 30, 2011 (UTC) 
 Actually, my mistake, I misread it as you can't use it in the OCG for some reason, when you meant you can't use it in TCG.  - Falzar FZ - ( talk page | useful stuff )  02:35, October 1, 2011 (UTC) 
 Mind Crush  really trips up Machina Gadget decks, especially those that use the Gadget chain with Ultimate Offering for Xyz. -- Gadjiltron  ( talk  •  contribs ) 13:03, October 6, 2011 (UTC)
 
 Dark World 
 " Kycoo the Ghost Destroyer " is good for blocking Gates and Smog, and fiddles with the Graveyard. He dies to Raven and Snoww+, though. 
 Maybe you could add the caveat "bypassed by  Dark World Lightning "; that card makes Debunk very hard to use.

 Rabbit / Evolsar 
 Any Ideas to stop this new threat?  Ruicub  ( talk  •  contribs ) 12:07, November 15, 2011 (UTC)
 Imperial Iron Wall . More  Effect Veiler .  BF2    Talk    Deck Guides  17:37, November 15, 2011 (UTC)
 Use  Dark Trap Hole  and  Giant Trap Hole  to counter rescue rabbit, it should work quite effectively seen as it was originally desinged to counter  Rescue Cat .  Karma Cut  can annoy rescue rabbit although he he may re summmoned later with  Leviair the Sea Dragon

 I sided  Lava Golem  during Six Samurai format. I plan to do the same if the Rabbit Dino deck becomes big. It won't, though. It can't compare to Plant Synchro.  Lappyzard  ( talk  •  contribs ) 17:59, November 19, 2011 (UTC)
 Any more advice to counter Rabbit / Evolzar?  24.0.144.144  ( talk ) 00:57, November 25, 2011 (UTC)
 
 Imperial Iron Wall  works.  Maxx "C"  is pretty effective just to draw cards.  BF2    Talk    Deck Guides  01:10, November 25, 2011 (UTC)
 No one's mentioned " Summon Limit "? Also, " Rivalry of Warlords " pretty much locks Xyzs. 
 Designless Square  ( talk  •  contribs ) 01:55, December 10, 2011 (UTC)
 
 Why has nobody mentioned  Mirror of Oaths ? I side deck two nowadays on DN to stop Rabbit and GB.  Menace13  ( talk  •  contribs ) at 04:03, December 10, 2011 (UTC)
 Nobody seems to realise that Gozen Match just kills off Dino Rabbit. I think a Blackwing-Gozen Deck could easily win, as could a Dragunity-Gozen Deck.  Vyomo 
 
 Dark World 
 I have a sugggestion for side decking against dark worlds. You can side deck  Appropriate  , so that whenever they draw a card you also draw 2 cards, this can give you very good hand adavantage ,and it can be combined with  Maxx "C"  to get more extra cards.
 
 matthew.lightbody@talktalk.net  ( talk  •  contribs ) 14:04, November 25, 2011 (UTC)
 
 
 Exodia 
 For Exodia, can we put Exchange to "cripples the deck completely", and add  Amazoness Chain Master  (not as good since you have to get it killed, but still useable).  Battlemaniac  ( talk  •  contribs ) 16:44, January 2, 2012 (UTC)
 
 BF2's Additions 
 4-Star Ladybug of Doom  against Gadgets, Gravekeeper's, and Gladiator Beasts.
 Steelswarm is actually pretty good, and if added,  Blackwing - Jin the Rain Shadow  is an side card (Catastor against them). If I'm not mistaken,  Des Donut  hurts them as well.  Infestation Wave  actually hurts them as you can return their monster to their hand and destroy their card.
 Chain Burn  is missing -  Rainbow Life ,  Des Wombat ,  Lifeforce Harmonizer , and  Prime Material Dragon  are all good sides against them.  Vanity's Emptiness  is also incredibly against them as it even stops their draw cards.
 Cursed Seal of the Forbidden Spell , while a -1, will almost certainly paralyze Dragunities and hurt Gravekeeper's.  Field Barrier  hurts them as well, preventing them from playing Field Spell Cards.
 Fossil Dyna Pachycephalo  is a godsend against Fabled - protect it with a Trap or two and you can't lose.
 Huge Revolution Reversal  is good against Scrap (Scrap Dragon).
 Hunter of Black Feathers  is good against any mono-Attribute Archetype - Agents, Sabers, Dark World, etc.
 Infinite Dismissal  against Plants.
 Karakuri Klock  works against Karakuri.
 More to come.
  BF2    Talk    Deck Guides  18:00, January 5, 2012 (UTC)
 King Tiger Wanghu  stops Mystical Shine Balls and destroys Earth, as well as destroying Kageki/Kagemusha/Elder (which cripples Six Samurai), destroys most X-Sabers, destroys Infernities (other than Archfiend), hurts Plants/Naturia, devastates Inzektor Wind-Ups, makes Treeborn Frog useless, etc.
 Rescue Laggia is missing,  Mirror of Oaths ,  Smashing Horn , and  Bottomless Trap Hole  are all effective side cards, as is  Imperial Iron Wall .
 Snowman Eater  is good against  Miracle Gemini .
 Widespread Dud  is bait against X-Sabers and Scraps that gets rid of their cards.  BF2    Talk    Deck Guides  19:04, January 5, 2012 (UTC)
 Made some modifications, more to come.  BF2    Talk    Deck Guides  19:26, January 5, 2012 (UTC)
 
 I think you meant  Karakuri Trick House . 
 Rivalry of Warlords  and  Gozen Match  are pretty good against Rabbit and Wind-Ups.  D.D. Crow  works okay against Wind-Ups and Inzektors if you can cut their loops short. They can go for Leviair if you mispredict and they're still holding Gallis or Spell Striker, though.  24.199.53.194  ( talk ) 21:14, February 17, 2012 (UTC) 
 More cards to cripple Dragunities 
 Could you side in a  Dark Highlander  against a  Dragunity  deck since it stops all  Synchro Summons  and can take out  Equip Cards  and burn for each?  Not to mention having a 2800 atk level 7 beatstick on the field Ja1lbreakr0cks  ( talk  •  contribs ) 17:20, February 12, 2012 (UTC)
 
 Newer Archetypes 
 Some I'm thinking of:  
 Rabbit: 
 Ryko, Lightsworn Hunter . 
 Penguin Soldier . 
 Snowman Eater , etc. 
Not many run Dolkka or try to get it out, most go for Laggia which is only really vulnerable to flip effect monsters or monsters already on the field. 
 Summon Limit , but it doesn't solve the first turn problem. 
 Overlay Owl  but they would negate its summon anyway. 
 Inzektors: 
 Effect Veiler . 
 D.D. Crow . 
 Shadow-Imprisoning Mirror . 
 Consecrated Light  (only if they have no hornet equipped, so not that great). 
 Necrovalley  (not extremely good but decent). 
 Safe Zone  (they pop it they lose a monster, not amazing though). 
 Fiendish Chain . 
 Chain Disappearance . 
 Wind-Ups: 
 Maxx "C" . 
 Effect Veiler . 
 D.D. Crow ? 
 Regenerating Mummy  possibly, if they send it to the grave you add it back to your hand, they're likely to hit it constantly when the hand gets low. Not bad to draw into too. 
 Neko Mane King  possibly, if they hit it their turn ends, risky though, bad to draw into too. Could also be a side against Dark Worlds. 
Since these are a first turn deck at the moment I won't list cards that need to be already on the field. 
 Hieroglyphs:    (I don't know much about these) 
 Maxx "C" . 
I'm not sure if  Effect Veiler  does much against them. 
 Zombie World , tribute summon quite a lot (although that might be tribute to summon), and it stops quite a few Dragon specific cards. 
 Mask of Restrict . 
 Light-Imprisoning Mirror , most of them are light. 
 Shadow-Imprisoning Mirror , it'd stop their REDMD. 
 Summon Limit , they spam a lot. 
 King Tiger Wanghu  since they spam 0 attack monsters quite often. 
Any negate special summon cards like  Fossil Dyna Pachycephalo . 
 Ninjas:   
 Thunder King Rai-Oh , they add to the hand often. 
 Effect Veiler  can really hurt their  Upstart Golden Ninja . 
 Royal Decree  can hurt, but they don't really need  Ninjitsu Art of Super-Transformation  to run, Xyz spamming with dead traps would work almost as well. 
 Warrior Elimination , they don't spam much though. 
 Any other new top tier(ish) archetype I'm forgetting? 
 121.222.228.13  ( talk ) 04:10, February 20, 2012 (UTC)
 Against Rabbits, you're better off with  Spirit Reaper ,  Arcana Force 0 - The Fool ,  Marshmallon , and, believe it or not,  Wave-Motion Cannon . Dolkka can negate the Flip Effect monsters making them less useful.  Lava Golem  is also an insanely good side against them.
 Hieroglyphs don't have to use REDMD, so strike Shadow-Imprisoning Mirror. Wanghu isn't very effective as they'll kill it with either an effect or by battle (their 0 attack monsters would come out after they've destroyed him). Leeching the Light is decent against Hieroglyphs as they have high ATK monsters.
 For Ninjas, Shadow-Imprisoning Mirror isn't a bad side - it stops Tour Guide and Hanzo.
  BF2    Talk    Deck Guides  14:19, February 20, 2012 (UTC)
 
 I completely forgot about Hanzo being dark. And why would  Wave-Motion Cannon  be a good side against rabbit? I'm not quite getting that. Is it because if they don't negate it they could get big damage, if they do they lose materials? Because if that's the case wouldn't cards like  Smashing Ground  or  Dimensional Prison  be better? 123.211.144.181  ( talk ) 08:11, February 21, 2012 (UTC) 
 If you watch !      Xcloud (some number of spaces) play on DN, you'll see that he sides everything against Rabbits. He does extremely well against Rabbits by siding in a bunch of wall monsters (The Fool, Reaper, Marshmallon) an Wave-Motion Cannon. If I'm not mistaken, they don't run a lot of Spell/Trap removal...  BF2    Talk    Deck Guides  17:33, February 21, 2012 (UTC)
 I can see why the stall monsters would work. Their only real destruction cards would be  Dark Hole , maybe 1 or 2  Smashing Ground  or  Dimensional Prison , and I don't think you'll be attacking much with the stall monsters. But  Wave-Motion Cannon  still seems iffy to me, Laggia can negate it if they wish, but I guess it'd make them think a bit more if they want to use those solemns that have set later too. 123.211.144.181  ( talk ) 08:18, February 22, 2012 (UTC)
 They don't use a lot of backrow destruction and Laggia usually has better things to negate (and if they negate it, you're free to use Dark Hole or another good card).  BF2    Talk    Deck Guides  13:45, February 22, 2012 (UTC)
 What about  Mask of Restrict  for Hieratics? I feel as if it would be a > or + card on the above list, because most Hieratic plays and means of destroying cards come from tribute effects.  108.196.206.15  ( talk ) 14:27, June 21, 2012 (UTC)
 
 + would be appropriate. It shuts down the engine, but like Macro Cosmos and Necrovalley it's vulnerable to Tefnuit -> A Wingbeat of Giant Dragon.  207.233.120.2  ( talk ) 00:01, June 28, 2012 (UTC) 
 Dino rabbits,Wind-up and Inzektors 
 This list should have sections for those 3 i have some cards : inzektors:
 
 necrovalley:stops dragonfly and others from equipping hornet from graveyard. 
 d.d. Crow:when they try to get hornet from the grave,chain and LOL at their dragonfly unassisted 
 different dimension ground:chain this to anything they use to dump hornet in grave. 
 effect veiler:use to stop inzektors from equipping anything. 
 macro cosmos:unlike dimensional fissure,this works on spells

 Having played Wind-Ups, I find it horribly injurious when the opponent springs a  Bottomless Trap Hole  on Zenmaity. Breaks the loop, leaves the Wind-Up player struggling for a turn. Oh, wait, do you guys still have the Priority ruling? Guess it won't work that way for the TCG. At least it still can be used on Shark. 
 Effect Veiler  is also particularly useful in defusing Zenmaity and Rat. Especially Rat, since they will be left with a monster with 600 ATK in Attack Position just asking to be beaten in. 
 -- Gadjiltron  ( talk  •  contribs ) 14:06, March 5, 2012 (UTC)
 In the list above,  Cursed Seal of the Forbidden Spell  is listed twice for Gravekeeper's (with different ratings of effectiveness). Also, how about  Consecrated Light  against Steelswarms and  Royal Decree  against Chain Burn?  207.233.120.2  ( talk ) 18:57, March 7, 2012 (UTC)
 
 I just realized,  Gozen Match  and  Rivalry of Warlords  can both cripple Wind-Ups, right?  99.165.192.113  ( talk ) 00:50, March 8, 2012 (UTC) 
 Yes, and they cripple Dino Rabbit as well. -->  Summoned Skull 2:   Electric Boogaloo   00:52, March 8, 2012 (UTC) 
 -- 68.41.75.225  ( talk ) 08:55, April 2, 2012 (UTC)I have found Icy Crevice to be a interesting card to side agaisnt insector players. It will hurt them for playing hornet and has the potential to break up loops. In addition after its been played once the oppenent will begin to act more cautiously around single backfields. Just a card not widely expected that can throw insecktors off their game.
 
 If they shot your monster before shooting your back row, they are being silly. Which reminds me: " Wild Tornado " and " Security Orb ". 207.233.120.2  ( talk ) 17:35, April 23, 2012 (UTC) 
 We need to update the table at the top for the current meta. Someone please do it. Its really accessible to all users and its a good list with good explanations.

 With the recent changes to Ignition Priority (now "Fast Effect Timing", i.e. nonexistent for Ignition Effect Monsters), " Effect Veiler " becomes a viable side against Dino Rabbit.  Designless Square  ( talk  •  contribs ) 18:32, April 26, 2012 (UTC) 
 For the record, I haven't played for a long time, I'm not sure about the current meta, or what to use against it. 
 I've mentioned a couple of times that anyone can edit the list as long as they know what they're doing (follow proper table syntax); or post below if they're not sure about adding to the table. 
 - Falzar FZ - ( talk page | useful stuff )  23:45, April 26, 2012 (UTC) 
 ok.. i'll get some small suggestions on the most common cards to use against the meta decks.
 Dino-Rabbits  gozen/rivalry. different attibutes and types, rabbit being earth/beast. rest being dino/ earth or water or fire. Xyz monsters are dragon/fire.
 effect veiler, post priority ruling, priority was able to cause it to use its effect before veiler so it was off the field before veiler activates. also useful to negate evolsar dollka if one feels like doing so. forces them to waste material.
 chain disappearance, better post priority. similar reason to above, though it will leave the field first. Also able to use against tour guide, another staple against this deck.
 spirit reaper/marshmallon, good stallking monster cards, do not activate, does not need to be normal or special summoned(set) thus cannot be negated when attacked. good stall card to stop them from beating you down.
 
Inzektors: shadow imprisoning, all dark, activate on field in order to control. not unlike reasons for infernity
 macro cosmos, does not allow them to send hornet or any other equipped inzektor card to the graveyard. same thing as shadow imprisoning.
 effect veiler, generally good at negating their effects of all monsters
 chain disappearance, able to banish a dragonfly or hornet if they get summoned. stops their special summoning mechanic and causes them to not be able to swarm.
 Wind-ups,  gozen/rivalry. all different types and attributes. no explanation needed
 cyber dragon/chimeratech. wind-up XYZ cards are all machine type, thus a good card to counter. to zenmaines and zenmeity.
 effect veiler. able to stop wind up loop during first turn loop
 maxx C. negates the effects of wind up loop, by drawing more cards then they make you discard.
 
 There are definitely more cards to side deck against these and other matchups but this is the general kick start to the big 3 decks this format. effect veiler may be a general card as people main deck it as well. but always good to mention.
 other deck types inc darkworlds, heroes. main meta decks that have not been mentioned above.
 Roughpuppet  ( talk  •  contribs ) 14:19, April 27, 2012 (UTC)
 Guys, read the original comments Falzar made. 
" Ignoring  Staples  as they are not Side Deck material. "
Under  Staples :  
Effect Monsters
 
 Maxx C 
 Effect Veiler 
 Perhaps Maxx "C" shouldn't be listed. But certain OTK Decks like  Dark Gaia OTK  and  Empty Jar  will end the game if your opponent drops " Heavy Storm " or " Trap Stun " and you don't have Veiler. Maybe Glads or Zombies don't need Veiler against most things, but there are times when it's the only viable option.  Designless Square  ( talk  •  contribs ) 17:27, May 3, 2012 (UTC) 
 But the thing is they're a main deck card where you side the rest, they aren't cards you'd side if you don't main them.

 Well, against Dino Rabbit, I would suggest side decking  Black Ray Lancer  and  Galaxy-Eyes Photon Dragon ,not to mention  Neo Galaxy-Eyes Photon Dragon , whose overwhelming effect can destroy any Dino decks. I would also recommend the forgotten  Majestic Star Dragon , who can destroy a Dino Rabbit deck in seconds
If you aren't maining Maxx "C"/Veiler you probably shouldn't be siding them either.

 Lancer and Galaxy-Eyes most likely won't make it to the field, and Lancer only has 2100 ATK anyways. " Majestic Star Dragon " is unlikely to land as well, and won't be around on your opponent's turn. 
 What I meant about Veiler is that a Deck  which normally has no need for Veilers, is compelled to run them to protect itself from what would otherwise be an unpreventable OTK. Ancient history. 
 " Trap Hole " works nicely against Inzektors, killing Dragonfly, Centipede, and Hopper. It doesn't hit Hornet,  Ladybug  or DAD, but it can't be circumvented with Zektkaliber (unlike Veiler), a chained MST (unlike S-IM,  Skill Drain ,  Macro Cosmos  and  Fiendish Chain ), and it's not a half-answer like  BTH / Chain Disappearance .

 A "Best of all worlds" list 
 Is there any chance that we could get an ideal list of cards to side? Maybe rank the top 20 cards to side, in the order of their priority? Like, Light-Imprisoning Mirror can shut down Lightsworns, but aside from them and Hieratics, there's not much reason to side it. Conversely, Effect Veiler and Maxx "C" are listed as "effective" for their sections, yet they work against any and all decks. For people who need help quickly organizing a side deck to combat any and all threats, a small list of cards that are recommended for all side decks would be helpful, since while no one can tell you what cards you HAVE to put in your main deck, a side deck can always run the same 15 cards no matter what deck you use, and will almost always be just as effective.

 The problem with this is what you should side changes quite constantly depending on the area and what's been used in big tournaments. 
 Take some of the latest ones for example, people removed sides for Wind-Ups because they weren't doing well at all, no point siding against a deck that has such little showing when there's more important ones right? This in-turn let a few Wind-Up players top at a few tournaments which ofcourse made people start siding against them again. 
 And then there's local tournaments where the meta may be GB's, GK's, Machina Gadgets, Lightsworn, etc.

 Then just make a list of all purpose side cards.  IPlay4Fun  ( talk  •  contribs ) 15:05, August 5, 2012 (UTC) 
 I like the idea, it could be useful to build a quick base to a side deck, which can then be slightly adjusted, depending on local meta and such. Cards like gozen match for example, hits not only wind-ups and rabbit, but can hit decks in lower tiers likely to be seen in local 'meta', such as GBs and Six-sams. Obviously if your local meta is straight dark worlds and insectors say, then you can customize the base to suit you (i.e. shadow-imprisoning etc)  Chewbacca The Drummer  ( talk  •  contribs ) 17:37, August 5, 2012 (UTC)
 You can do this by sorting the table by Sided Card instead of Deck. At present, The End of Anubis has 9 entries, Chain Disappearance has 10 entries, Necrovalley has 13 entries, D.D. Crow has 14 entries, Skill Drain has 17 entries, D-Fissure has 18 entries, and Macro Cosmos top the list with 19 entries.  98.148.148.43  ( talk ) 16:03, August 7, 2012 (UTC) 
 Tier Divisions 
 I do not think the divisions on the  Tier List  page should be applied to this page until the creators of that page come to a formal definition of what constitutes a "Tier".  Designless Square  ( talk  •  contribs ) 20:49, August 20, 2012 (UTC)
 
 Suggestion 
 I've noticed several side deck suggestions are designed to counter strategies that are now rendered obsolete due to said strategy being shut down by the banlist. For example, some cards suggested against Wind-Ups are brought up with the now-defunct Hunter loop in mind. I'm pretty sure the same will apply to several other tournament decks which were forced to change their playstyle after certain banlists are implemented. Should we remove suggestions that no longer apply? -- Gadjiltron  ( talk  •  contribs ) 04:54, December 19, 2012 (UTC)
 
 Absolutely. Also, I am dismayed to find that someone added "Tier" divisions to the list, again. Which is funny because some of these Decks don't even operate outside the OCG. Maybe I can understand why they seem official since we have a page about them, but there's no reason to have the Tier divisions if we include stuff that's common in the OCG but not here. Particularly amusing is " Madolche " in the "Tier 2" box when  it's not even on the list . Can we get rid of them too? (And add some sides for Madolche, I guess.)

 Having this information in visual form would really help. I don't have much experience with it so I'm not really able to help in that regard. A Venn diagram maybe?
 
 I mostly want to eliminate seeing the same card, good against more than one deck, written twice. 72.89.194.84  ( talk ) 14:27, January 4, 2013 (UTC) 
 Dragon Rulers 
 I really think you should add some good cards to side in against the new Dragon Ruler Archetype. Cards that come to mind are Gozen Match and Mind Drain.  24.8.106.176  ( talk ) 23:39, June 6, 2013 (UTC)
 
 Not only the Dragon Rulers, the list also needs to have cards against " Prophecy "/" Spellbook " and " Evilswarm " Decks. -- Missign0  ( talk  •  contribs ) 02:27, June 7, 2013 (UTC) 
 I don't really know if I'm doing this right and if not Im sorry. But a few good cards that I have found to work against them would be (for example)
 Effect Monsters: 
Battle Fader: Free no battle phase on direct attack and useable with backrow unlike gorz 
Trifortressops: 2800 ( starting ) defense means no killing it with blasterfor a turn 
Swift Scarecrow: Usable with Macro/D Fiss on the field as it doesn't say "to the grave" 
Grand Mole: Bounce back drago sac as it doesnt destroy (**vunerable to d prison/other battle traps though) 
Veiler +Maxx c: Assuming no macro Veiler either A. Stops big eye, B. Stops Dragosac from making tokens. Either one is a good thing
Droll & Lock Bird: Prevents adding other dragons AND super Rejuv ((I think  [1]  ?))
(when it comes out JOTL ((Same as key beetle)) Flying "c" :When your opponnent special summons a monster summon this to their field. They can not xyz (but it is an earth lv 1 so they could still do some synchro shenanigans with it)
(Maybe) Cyber dragon + Chimeratech (at the minimum it would have 3 k attack from the cy dra, dragosac, and 1 token (assuming they poped with it. If not then you got a 4 k chim, that even if warned they 1. Lost drago and tokens and 2. Wasted their only solemn (judg/warn) **CAUTION** do not rely on this because it  will  NOT  work with macro on the field as chimera says grave specifically
 Synchro Monsters 
Crimson Blader: Kill token, eff goes off, ???, Proffit
 Magic  (Uhh, I havent really seen any that could work but maybe):
Messenger of peace: Either A. Makes them force a pop, B. Force them to use a lance to attack (IF they even run it. Which is doubtful). And if A. Then you just saved your other back row or monsters (granted to be popped by other monsters but still)
System Down: Only useful for dragosac as it doesnt destroy so it bypasses his natural token protection
One day of Peace: Gives you a turn to stall and take no damage but gives them a card too
Forbidden Dress: Universal destruction protection but attack lose is a pain (mostly to ophion)
 Trap 
Gozen Match/Rivalry: Both do the same thing essentially but both for different things. Gozen is more of a hard hitter as it prevents them from going into the double dragon instant xyz plays, but it could allow crimson blader in one VERY specific circumstance (Blaster + Flamvel Guard)
SUmmon Limit: Stops them from either 1. Getting the instant xyz or 2. Summoning the tokens (depending if they  somehow   Bold text had a lv 7 already on field)
Imperial Iron Wall: Just stops banishing. Brilliant

my opinion is
for against evilswarm, if u are synchro based deck, u can use  Number 30: Acid Golem of Destruction  or  Gem-Knight Pearl  for a start. if your deck spell & trap are  mostly destroy/ targeting  opponents monster type ( not monster destroyer like Dark armed dragon ), try to change swap cards like mirror force to increase attack power like  Horn of the Phantom Beast  ( refer to your deck ). this was based on assuming that evilswarm users are ophion 1 turn lover and relied too much on their immunity  Infestation Pandemic . easy win is to use cards like  Meklord Army of Granel  or grandmole. too lazy ? why don't use  Flying "C"  ?
 not much to say about dragons lord from me. gozen match, using compulsory, maxx c,  Chimeratech Fortress Dragon  ( drago-sack and it's token are machine ).
 can't say anything about spellbook cuz the one i fough before in real life is one without using extra deck ( and i don't know which style is the top tier or very strong )  Gemini 93  ( talk  •  contribs ) 14:26, July 1, 2013 (UTC)
 
 Well, I tried. 
 I tried to update the list for 2015, but I can't get all the changes to display.
At any rate, if someone wants to help cull the tips that are outdated, go nuts.  Designless Square  ( talk  •  contribs ) 04:36, January 26, 2015 (UTC)
