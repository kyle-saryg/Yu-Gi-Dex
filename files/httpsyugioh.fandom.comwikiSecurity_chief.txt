 Biography 
 History 
       Young chief, while combating  Duel Gang -related crime.     
 He faced a  Satellite   Duelist , who used " Skull Knight #2 " and Summoned " Assault Dog ". "Assault Dog"  destroyed  the Duelist's monster and proceeded to mercilessly  attack  him. [3] 
 He led Sector Security in their battle with  The Enforcers , which ultimately led to the team disbanding. After  Kalin Kessler , who viciously assaulted Security in the battle, was captured, Kalin spotted the officer patting  Yusei Fudo  on the shoulder, causing him to believe Yusei was a snitch. [3] 
 
 Yu-Gi-Oh! 5D's 
 Years later, he served as a senior officer in  Sector Security  in  Satellite , being  Tetsu Trudge 's boss. After Trudge lost to  Yusei , he gave Trudge a new Deck and  commented on how Trudge payed for the allegedly stolen parts with his own salary. Trudge replied that it was his pride as a Duelist and the chief reminded Trudge that he is a member of Security before he is a Duelist (in the dub, he told Trudge that he would rather have demoted him to handing out parking tickets, but  Jack  had ordered him to give Trudge another chance.) [4]
