 OCG Rulings 
 The  Attribute  of " Obelisk the Tormentor " is  DIVINE .  The  Type  of " Obelisk the Tormentor " is  Divine-Beast .
 " Abyssal Designator " can declare " DIVINE -Attribute" and " Divine-Beast -Type". [1] 
 Previously Official Rulings 
   These TCG rulings were issued by  Upper Deck Entertainment  and have since been deemed unofficial by Konami. [3]  They were previously considered official and can still be correct, as long as they follow the official gameplay rules, or unless Konami has issued a ruling that says otherwise. References:  [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] 
 
 If your opponent sends a  monster  to the  Graveyard  with the declared  Type  and  Attribute , you cannot see their  hand  and  Deck . But if they claim to have no such card, you can check their  hand  and  Deck  to confirm. 
 Judge List Rulings 
 It is possible to declare any  Attribute  and Monster  Type  combination, even if no monster of that combination exists. [2]
