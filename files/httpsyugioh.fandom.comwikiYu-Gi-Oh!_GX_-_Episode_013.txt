 Summary 
 At a  lab  in the middle of the  forests  surrounding  Duel Academy , alarms are sounding. Men run through the halls, loading rifles with tranquilizer darts. One of their test subjects is escaping: a monkey outfitted in partial robotic suit, and armed with a  Duel Disk .  Chazz Princeton  has packed his bags, and plans to leave Duel Academy for good. He exits the building and walks off. Later,  Syrus Truesdale  rushes to inform  Jaden Yuki , who is disappointed that his rival has gone.  Taiyou Torimaki  and  Raizou Mototani  begin laughing over Chazz's loss to  Bastion Misawa , showing their true colors. Jaden and Syrus sneak out of class to go find Chazz, and end up meeting  Alexis Rhodes ,  Mindy  and  Jasmine  outside, who also want to find him. As they search through the forest, the monkey from earlier jumps from the bushes, grabs Jasmine, and runs off. The men from the lab are following the monkey, who takes Jasmine to the edge of cliff. Jaden's group and the lab workers corner him there. The person who appears to be the head scientist explains that the monkey is a test subject named  Wheeler , whom they have trained as a  Duelist . One of the other lab workers reminds him that such information is top-secret.
 Jaden challenges the monkey to a  Duel  in order to get him to release Jasmine. The monkey seems to agree to the terms, and the Duel begins. Since he released Jasmine, one of the lab men moves to shoot him with the tranquilizer rifle, but the head scientist stops him, saying that they should be able to gather interesting data from the Duel. 
 Jaden begins by Summoning " Elemental HERO Sparkman " in  Attack Position . Wheeler Summons " Berserk Gorilla " in Attack Position, which destroys "Sparkman"; he then  Sets  a card to end his turn. 
 Jaden plays " Polymerization ",  fusing  " Elemental HERO Avian " and " Elemental HERO Burstinatrix " to  Fusion Summon  " Elemental HERO Flame Wingman ", which attacks and destroys "Berserk Gorilla". Wheeler loses 2100  LP  in Battle Damage and from Flame Wingman's effect. The head scientist believes that Jaden shouldn't underestimate Wheeler, but has different reasons for doing so  between the versions . 
 Wheeler continues, Summoning " Acrobat Monkey ", and activating his face-down"  DNA Surgery "; he chooses to turn all face-up monsters into  Beast - Types . "Acrobat Monkey" and "Flame Wingman" visibly morph into more bestial, animal-like forms. Wheeler then plays " Wild Nature's Release ", increasing "Acrobat Monkey's"  ATK  by its  DEF , for a total of 2800. He attacks and destroys "Flame Wingman". "Acrobat Monkey" is also destroyed via "Wild Nature's Release".
 As Jaden begins his turn, he notices a large group of monkeys nearby, watching the Duel, and he realizes that Wheeler fled the lab so that he could return his friends. Wheeler confirms this, but Jaden must continue the Duel to save Jasmine. He Summons " Elemental HERO Clayman ", which morphs into a Beast-Type due to "DNA Surgery". Jaden then plays " Courageous Charge ",  paying  1000 LP and targeting "Clayman", whose DEF will now also be deducted from the opponent's LP should he inflict Battle Damage. "Clayman" attacks  directly , winning Jaden the Duel. 
 Wheeler runs over to Jasmine, and deposits her back down in front of the group. The scientists proceed to try to recapture Wheeler, and Jaden intervenes, wishing for the monkey to remain with its friends. They ignore him, and the head scientist even states that he plans to take all the monkeys back to the lab and make them test subjects as well. One of them aims his tranquilizer rifle, but before he can fire,  Pharaoh  appears out of nowhere and jumps on the man's head.  Professor Banner  is close behind. After he threatens to expose their project and have them arrested for animal cruelty, they let the monkeys go. Banner then reveals that Chazz is fine, but has left Duel Academy on his family's yacht.
 
 Featured Duel: Jaden Yuki vs. Wheeler 
 
 This Duel uses  Yu-Gi-Oh! GX  anime gameplay . Rules and  card effects  may differ from that of the  TCG / OCG . See the individual card articles for more information.     
 Turn 1: Jaden 
 Jaden   draws  " Elemental HERO Sparkman " and subsequently  Normal Summons  it (1600/1400) in  Attack Position .
 Turn 2: Wheeler 
 Wheeler  draws " Berserk Gorilla " and subsequently Normal Summons it (2000/1000) in Attack Position. "Berserk Gorilla"  attacks  and  destroys  "Sparkman" (Jaden: 4000 → 3600 LP). Wheeler  Sets  a card.
 Turn 3: Jaden 
Jaden draws " Polymerization " and subsequently  activates  it to  fuse  " Elemental HERO Avian " and " Elemental HERO Burstinatrix " to  Fusion Summon  " Elemental HERO Flame Wingman " (2100/1200) in Attack Position. "Flame Wingman" attacks and destroys "Berserk Gorilla" (Wheeler: 4000 → 3900 LP). Since "Flame Wingman" destroyed a  monster   by battle  and  sent  it to the  Graveyard , its  effect  activates, inflicting  damage  to Wheeler equal to his destroyed monster's  ATK  (Wheeler: 3900 → 1900 LP).
 Turn 4: Wheeler 
Wheeler draws. He then Normal Summons " Acrobat Monkey " (1000/1800) in Attack Position. Wheeler activates his  face-down  " DNA Surgery " and  declares   Beast  for its effect. Now all  face-up  monsters must become the  Type  Wheeler declared as long as "DNA Surgery" is face-up. Wheeler then activates " Wild Nature's Release " to increase the  ATK  of "Acrobat Monkey" by its  DEF  ("Acrobat Monkey": 1000 → 2800 ATK) until the  End Phase , at which point it will be destroyed. "Acrobat Monkey" attacks and destroys "Flame Wingman" (Jaden: 3600 → 2900 LP). At the End Phase, "Acrobat Monkey" is destroyed.
 Turn 5: Jaden 
Jaden draws " Courageous Charge ". He then Normal Summons " Elemental HERO Clayman " (800/2000) in Attack Position. He then activates " Courageous Charge " to  pay  1000  LP  (Jaden: 2900 → 1900 LP) and select "Clayman" for its effect. Now when "Clayman" inflicts  Battle Damage  to Wheeler this turn, Wheeler will take damage equal to the DEF of "Clayman". "Clayman" attacks  directly  (Wheeler: 1900 → 1100 LP). The effect of "Courageous Charge" activates (Wheeler: 1100 → 0 LP).
 
 Differences in adaptations 
 In the original version of the previous episode, Chazz is expelled for losing to Bastion. This scene was cut to the dub. As a result, dialogue is added to the dub explaining that Chazz left out of spite. In the original, Chazz simply says a reluctant goodbye. 
 In the original, the other students are unaware that Chazz has left and assume that he is hiding somewhere on the island. In the dub, everyone is aware that Chazz has left, which makes it seem strange that Jaden would look for him in the woods. 
 In the Japanese version, the monkey's name was SAL, which is an acronym for "Super Animal Learning", and was pronounced as "saru", which is also the Japanese word for monkey, creating a pun. As  Duel Academy  was founded by  Seto Kaiba , the English version changed the monkey's name to  Wheeler , as a reference to Kaiba  calling  Joey Wheeler  a "Dueling monkey" twice in the dub of  the second series anime . 
 In the Japanese version, the head scientist explains that Dueling terminology has been programmed into the monkey's helmet, while in the dub, he says that "the helmet reads his mind and then talks for him". 
 In the Japanese version, the head scientist warns against underestimating the monkey, due to that species' higher ability at discerning Duel Spirits. In the dub, he states that while the monkey was being trained, he was harshly punished for making mistakes. 
 In the Japanese version, when Pharaoh walks up to Banner after attacking the man with the tranquilizer gun, you can clearly see what appear to be his testicles. This is edited out in the English version. 
 Trivia 
 The Japenese version showed a preview of  Yu-Gi-Oh! The Movie: Pyramid of Light  with Jaden (Judai) narrating the preview. 
 Chazz doesn't appear for the next eleven episodes until his family's yacht breaks down in the middle of the ocean.
