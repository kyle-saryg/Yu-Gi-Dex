 Biography 
 Stardust Accelerator 
       Akiza disgusted at the player having a  Mark of the Dragon .     
 The  player  along with  Leo  and  Luna  visited the  Underground Duel Arena  in order to find the Witch, a person who was rumored to cause destruction and pain during her  Duels . Upon arriving in the arena, the twins questioned the witch's personality but are interrupted by a piercing scream of a man, followed by the roar of  a dragon . The crowds spectating the Duel screamed as Akiza approached the Duelist she defeated, but she was intercepted by the player. Upon approaching her, a sharp jolt shot through the player's head, returning some more of their lost memories. Akiza questioned what the player was hiding under their hand, and upon seeing their Mark of the Dragon, she becomes enraged, challenging the player to a  Duel . Afterwards, Akiza leaves.
 The player later faces Akiza in the semi-finals of the  Fortune Cup  tournament where she again threatens to destroy them for having a Mark of the Dragon, but she is defeated. After the Fortune Cup, Akiza is located in the Underground Duel Arena where her hatred for the player has disappeared now that their Mark of the Dragon has gone.
 
 Reverse of Arcadia 
 Awakening - Arcadia Movement 
       Yusei implores Akiza to think for herself.     
 The  player  is introduced to Akiza by  Sayer  shortly before she entered the Fortune Cup. Sayer requested that the player along with  Okita  and  Liquid  infiltrate  location of the tournament  to support Akiza. During the tournament,  Yusei Fudo  implored Akiza to think for herself shortly before defeating her with his " Stardust Dragon ". After her defeat, Akiza was escorted from the tournament by Sayer, who complimented her on doing a good job and suggested they return  home  for her to rest. They are however intercepted by  Lazar  along with two of his henchmen who requested Akiza come with them to talk to  Rex Goodwin . Wanting to return to the Arcadia Movement building, Sayer enlisted the help of the player, Okita and Liquid to prevent them from getting to Akiza.
 
       Akiza questions Sayer on what Yusei told her.     
 Upon returning to the Arcadia Movement, Sayer placed Akiza into a regenerative state where she questioned Sayer on what Yusei told her during the Fortune Cup. Annoyed, Sayer stated that Yusei spoke nothing but nonsense and that Akiza only had to listen to what he says. To sharpen up Akiza's Dueling, Sayer requested the help of the player. Upon entering Sayer's office, he insisted that Akiza go all out with her abilities and to think of it as training. Akiza thanked the player for agreeing to Duel. When the Duel concluded, Akiza's abilities threw the player into a wall, revealing that she still couldn't control them. Sayer then suggested that Akiza should go and rest. Before taking her leave, Akiza stopped and silently looked at the player before continuing to exit Sayer's office.
 
 The Journey - An Old Encounter, the Escape and a New Menace 
         Helpless, Akiza watches Sayer fall to his death.     
 During an attempted escape from the Arcadia Movement, the player overheard Akiza talking to  Misty Tredwell  who accused Akiza of killing her brother. The two then began a Duel. After the player arrived at Akiza's location, they witnessed Misty insult Akiza for being nothing but a destructive and selfish witch. She then watched helplessly as Sayer fell from the floor above to his apparent death. Due to the destruction that " Earthbound Immortal Aslla piscu " caused, Misty postponed the Duel and left. Akiza and the player were then escorted from the building by Yusei. As Akiza was harmed during the assault, Yusei insisted that she visit a doctor. Due to the destruction of the Arcadia Movement building, Akiza and the player were left homeless, but Yusei suggested that they stay at  Blister's apartment  for the time being. Yusei later informed the player that the doctor said Akiza was fine. 
 
         Akiza's abilities take over.     
 That night, several  Shadow Drones  infiltrated Blister's apartment, looking to Duel the player, Yusei and Akiza. Yusei held two off near the elevator whilst the player went to check on Akiza, but she had already been attacked by  Jean , making her go into an enraged state. Upon defeating the Shadow Drone, he returned to his normal self and left the building. However, Akiza's abilities took over and she became enraged and challenged the player to a Duel, threatening to tear the world apart. After being defeated, Akiza returned to herself but upon realising that Sayer had died, she began doubting her existence and purpose. Yusei informed Akiza that the player and he are her friends, and that as a Signer, they will always have a bond. Akiza thanked Yusei and agreed to help him in the war against the  Dark Signers . The three of them then agreed that it was late and went to sleep.
 
         Akiza and Yusei discuss whether they can trust Goodwin.     
 The next day, Akiza thanked the player for preventing her from going down a path of destruction, gifting them a " Queen of Thorns " card. Akiza then questioned the player on why they were involved with the Arcadia Movement and was shocked to hear that they were brainwashed by Sayer, having no idea that he was responsible for doing such things. The conversation was cut short as  Mina Simington  arrived and requested the attendance of Yusei, Akiza to  Rex Goodwin's mansion  to discuss the matter of the  Crimson Dragon  and the Dark Signers. After Mina left, Akiza asked Yusei whether they could trust Goodwin, to which Yusei told her that although after everything he had done, he was the only one who knew what was going on.
 
 Fate - Signers vs Dark Signers 
 Akiza later attends the meeting at Rex's mansion where he informed them that the Crimson Dragon was the one that guided their destinies to where they were. Akiza questioned Goodwin on whether it was her destiny to have the powers she hates and that have caused misery for both her and others, resulting in her becoming a pariah, to which Goodwin responds that without those abilities, none of them would have met. Rex informed them of the intentions of the Dark Signers which Akiza questioned him on how to stop them. She then became worried when Yusei insisted that he would defeat the Dark Signers and protect  Satellite  from being destroyed.
 After arriving in Satellite, Akiza was visited by Misty who instructed her to come to the  Ener-D control unit . Misty told Akiza that she wanted to Duel, not because she was a Dark Signer, but as a sister looking for revenge for the death of her  brother . She then quickly left to look for Misty, worrying Yusei in the process.
 
         A controlled Akiza threatens Misty.     
 Upon arriving at the Ener-D control unit, that Misty was guarding, the player noticed that Akiza had become the Black Rose Witch again, enraging Misty in the process as Akiza had revealed her "true self". The player spotted Sayer, who informed the player that he had put Akiza under his control and that he was the one responsible for Misty's brother's death. After the player defeated Sayer, he ran off saying that as long as he had Akiza, he was fine. The player then chased Sayer and ran into Mina, who informed them that Akiza displayed her powers as normal until Sayer showed up, after which she became his puppet. Sayer then told Akiza to destroy Misty, which she agreed to. Misty overheard the player and Mina discussing what Sayer had done, realizing that he was the one responsible for her brother's death. Misty ordered her " Earthbound Immortal Ccarayhua " to consume Sayer, killing him. Realizing that Akiza was not responsible for her brother's death, Misty apologized to Akiza, stating that she had no reason to fight, but her " Earthbound Immortal " took control of her body. Sayer's death snapped Akiza from his control, but as she had no idea of what was occurring, the player stepped in, Dueling a controlled Misty in her place.
 
         Akiza comforts Misty before her death.     
 Defeated, Misty snapped out of the control of the "Earthbound Immortal" and was comforted by Akiza. Before dying, Misty told Akiza to protect the world as a Signer, asking Akiza not to forget about her. Akiza then sealed the control unit with her "Black Rose Dragon". Exhausted from what had happened, Akiza was taken home by Mina.
 
         Akiza riding the  Bloody Kiss   Duel Runner .     
 Akiza was later teleported to Rex Goodwin's mansion, where she watched the player Duel against Lazar. After the Duel, she was confused about why Lazar had Dueled the player and was shocked when a temple emerged from Goodwin's mansion. Yusei and Trudge then arrived, with Akiza informing them of what had happened. Akiza ran toward the temple, despite Mina's protests as she had promised Misty that she would protect the world as a Signer. After entering the courtyard, she wondered why the temple chose to surface and was shocked when Rex informed them that the world was doomed. After Rex informed the player, Yusei and Akiza that he was the one who summoned the  King of the Underworld , Akiza questioned Goodwin on why he did such a thing. When Rex embraced his condor birthmark, Akiza remarked that it was what happened to Misty. She then supported the player and Yusei during their Duels against Rex.
 During the epilogue, it was revealed that Akiza had learned how to Turbo Duel, riding her  Bloody Kiss  Duel Runner. The player could later find her in the  outer rim .
 
 Over the Nexus 
 Akiza wears her  riding outfit  in all appearances in this game. Her  original attire  can be unlocked for female players after completing a post-story side-quest.
 
 Changes - Preparing for the Tournament and a Looming Shadow 
 The  player  is introduced to Akiza by  Crow Hogan , informing them that Akiza had just become a Turbo Duelist. They then decided to Turbo Duel to help Akiza get used to riding her Duel Runner. A few days later, Akiza arrived at the garage again, looking for an opponent to Turbo Duel against, but  Misaki  was busy tuning her Duel Runner. Akiza informed Misaki that  Bruno  was extremely helpful with projects like that, she then displayed annoyance at how Yusei had been spending more time with Bruno than with her lately. After the player enlists the help of Bruno, Yusei realised how much he had been ignoring Akiza and left to apologise to her.
 
 To the Future - State of the WRGP and the World 
         Akiza cheers on the player.     
 Akiza took part in the  Battle Royal  between the  Diablo  and the  World Racing Grand Prix  contestants. She later cheered on the player alongside Crow, Leo, Luna, Misaki and  Toru  during their Duel against  Team New World . The player could later find her in the outer rim, alongside  Tetsu Trudge .
