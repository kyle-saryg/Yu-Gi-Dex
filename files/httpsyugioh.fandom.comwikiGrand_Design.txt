      The circuit completed     
 The  Grand Design , also known as  The Circuit , is an infinity-shaped circuit that the  Three Pure Nobles  wished to  complete in the  Yu-Gi-Oh! 5D's  anime.
 It has been shown during important events concerning  Primo ,  Jakob , and  Lester , that the usage of the Grand Design in the end is to enable the gigantic  Divine Temple  to descend upon  New Domino City .  
 Though not explicitly stated in the anime, it is possible that the Grand Design is a much larger version of the  Infinity  device created by the  Moment Express Development Organization , as it is in the shape of an infinity symbol, is powered by Ener-D, and is used to open a portal for the Divine Temple.
 
 History 
 Jakob revealed that the reason behind using the  WRGP  is to complete this circuit in order to "unleash the unlimited power they desire". [1]  The  Iliaster Trio  claims that when the circuit is completed,  the location  of what is apparently their " God " will be revealed to them, and when that happens, New Domino City will be destroyed due to it and the circuit being the same size. However, they think of it as a necessary sacrifice in order to "save the world." [2] 
 Jakob's plans to complete the Circuit were to do it using the  WRGP , but Primo wasn't satisfied with that, and to complete it faster, created an army of  Ghosts , called  Diablo , and used a  Battle Royal  system to hurry it up, causing a big chaos in the New Domino City. However, this wasn't successful in completing the Circuit.
 The Circuit itself is finally completed after  Yusei Fudo  defeats  Aporia  in the WRGP finals, allowing the  Divine Temple  to descend upon  New Domino City   (in the dub however, the Circuit was not completed, and the Divine Temple disappeared entirely from existence after Aporia's loss).  Antinomy  later discloses to Yusei that Z-one exploited Team 5D's to complete the Grand Design with the power of the  Accel Synchro , regardless of Aporia's defeat.
