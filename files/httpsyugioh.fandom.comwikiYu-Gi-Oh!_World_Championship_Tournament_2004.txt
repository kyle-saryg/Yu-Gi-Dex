 Opponents 
 Main article:  Yu-Gi-Oh! World Championship Tournament 2004  Opponents 
 See also:  Portal:Yu-Gi-Oh! World Championship Tournament 2004 characters 
 There are 28 opponents in the game. Each opponent has different skills and Decks revolving around a certain theme ( Yugi Muto  = Basic, Rare Hunter = Exodia,  Yami Yugi   = Ultimate, etc.). There is no conversation, you just start duels right away. 
 Sadly the weaker opponents Decks are full of junk monsters that aren't worth battling like  Winged Cleaver .
The stronger opposing Decks (Level Four and above) put up a higher challenge since they ignore card limitations.
 Since many opponents don't use cards against opponents spells/traps the use of stalling cards like  Gravity Bind  can make winning a pretty easy task.
 
 AI behavior 
 The AI...
 shows signs of "knowing" face-down cards. i.e. they never attack a set monster if it has higher DEF than their monsters ATK. 
 never attacks a monster with highest ATK on the field even if they have an equally strong monster and would be able to attack with other monsters afterwards. 
 will  Normal Summon   Slate Warrior  in  Attack Position  and  attack  on the same  turn , even if your  monster  has an equal ATK. 
 on the turn after  summoning   Slate Warrior , will switch Slate Warrior to  Defense Position , even if it's the strongest monster on the  field  and it would make sense to keep it in  Attack Position . 
 only attacks an opponents monster with equal or higher  ATK  in  Defense Position  (like i.e.  Spear Dragon ) when they have a monster with piercing effect. 
 activates (all of its) traps/spells even while  Royal Decree / Imperial Order  is in play. They are all negated though. 
 doesn't use their  Mirror Force  as long as they have  Fairy Box  in play. 
 sometimes only returns 1 of the opponents monsters to their hand using  Penguin Soldier 
 sometimes uses their  Mystical Space Typhoon  on their self. 
 Always Tribute Summons, even if the tributed  monster  was stronger than the new monster. 
 Even Tribute Summons when the tributed monster is the same monster as the new one. 
 tributes a face-down flip effect monster without  Flip summoning  it first 
 activates  Monster Reborn  in  Main Phase 2  even if they would have won the  duel  when using it before their  Battle Phase . 
 does not hesitate to finish them self  i.e. by destroying a face-up opponents  Black Pendant  while having less than 500 LP 
 never uses their  Snatch Steal 
 often gets the correct outcome when it activates the effect of  Time Wizard . 
 uses  Backup Soldier  when its activation requirements are fulfilled even if they don't retrieve any monster from their graveyard at that time. 
 If a card effect would make one of the AI's monsters stronger than your highest-ATK monster, but the monster is naturally weaker than the latter, the AI will still play it in Defense Position. However, it will switch the monster to Attack Position at the next opportunity. 
 Cards 
 Main article:  List of Yu-Gi-Oh! World Championship Tournament 2004 cards 
 See also:  Category:Yu-Gi-Oh! World Championship Tournament 2004 sets 
 After winning a duel you can choose a booster pack containing 5 cards.
 In most cases one of the cards is a (highlighted) rare card. There can be only 1 rare card per pack.
Since the AI wants you to receive all cards in the game most of the cards it offers are cards you haven't collected so far which makes it hard to collect 3 copies especially of the rare cards.

 Trunk 
 The number of total cards shown in the top bar is sadly not the number of different cards collected so far. It really means the total number of all cards you have.
The other numbers in the sub categories only refer to the number of cards in your actually used deck.
 You can sort cards (only ascending) by chosing sorting criterias one after another. The previous sortings are kept as far as possible. (i.e. sort by 1) name 2) DEF 3) ATK)
 Sadly there is no useful sorting criteria for spells and traps beside "name".
 For faster scrolling through the card list push the left/right-button.You will jump to the next 4 cards. For even faster scrolling hold the B-button and press up/down.
 You start the game with 120 random cards. The default Deck can be optimized right away with other cards in your trunk in most cases.
 There are cards which are Limited or Semi-Limited. (for you but not for the opponents of higher level).
 
 Game Speed 
 The speed of Gameplay is relatively slow but can be sped up by holding  L  while dueling or just hold  L  while choosing an opponent.
 
 Glitches 
 Card text 
 In both card text and card names, "Magician" has been replaced by "Spellian". This affects cards including " Dark Magician ", " Magician of Black Chaos ", and " Dark Magician Girl ". This is likely as a result of a last-minute changing of "Magic" to " Spell " using a mass-text replacer on the ROM before release. 
 Card Effect 
 You are not asked if you want to activate a trap on an empty game state. So it is not possible to use  Call of the Haunted  during your opponents end phase i.e. 
 You cannot confirm your opponents deck by yourself when using cards like  Nobleman of Extermination . 
 Axe of Despair  is not placed on top of your deck even if you have offered a monster for its effect. 
 You take all the damage from " Burning Land ". 
 Terrain bonuses sometimes do not benefit the player, but it does benefits AI. 
 Despite the text saying otherwise, " Maiden of the Aqua " does give the same stat bonuses and penalties as " Umi " when it is face-up on the field. Until another field card is played then it deactivates. 
 After " Spear Dragon " has attacked, activate " Book of Moon " and "Spear Dragon" would be flipped facedown, therefore, the effect of "Spear Dragon" makes the card into facedown Attack Position. 
 Your monster is destroyed even if you chain  Book of Moon  to your opponents  Trap Hole . 
 Monsters gained through the effects of " Red-Moon Baby " are glitched. 
 Despite the text of " Spellbinding Circle " saying otherwise, if the targeted monster is Tributed, "Spellbinding Circle" is destroyed. 
 If " Spirit Reaper " is targeted by an Equip Spell, only the Spell is destroyed. 
 The opponent can switch  Man-Eater Bug  into  Defense Position  the turn it is  Flip Summoned  if no other cards in play prevent it. 
 When you activate  Call of the Haunted  during your own battle phase while your opponent has no monsters the summoned monster attacks automatically. 
 After  Book of Moon  was chained to set the target of an opponents  Ring of Destruction  the ring is sent to the graveyard even when  Banisher of Light  is faceup on your side of the field. 
 The effect of  Nimble Momonga  activates even when it was destroyed by the effect of  Sasuke Samurai . 
 The opponent can pay LP for  Chain Energy  even if it reduces them to zero. 
 The opponent  doesn't pay for  Chain Energy  when playing a card that destroys it, like  Heavy Storm 
 In the following situation you receive Damage equal to the (600) DEF points of an opponents  Man-Eater Bug : You Attack i.e. with  Gemini Elf , the AI activates  Mirror Force , you chain  Ring of Destruction , opponent chains  Seven Tools of the Bandit . 
 when  Zombyra the Dark  is removed from the field i.e. by the flip effect of a  Cyber Jar  it just destroyed, a replacement monster gets his ATK reduced by 200 (even if it is summoned in facedown DEF mode). 
 Trivia 
 The Japanese version of this game uses the censored  TCG  card artworks instead of the Japanese, except for some few cards.
