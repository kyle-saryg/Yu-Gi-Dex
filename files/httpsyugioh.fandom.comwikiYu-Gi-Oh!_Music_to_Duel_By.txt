 Yu-Gi-Oh! Music to Duel By  is the first album released by  4Kids TV .
 It contains many tracks used in the English-language dub of the  Yu-Gi-Oh!  second series anime (titled  Yu-Gi-Oh! Duel Monsters  in Japan). The CD also includes an expanded version of the English-language  Yu-Gi-Oh!  main theme. Some believe it may have been attempt by  4Kids Entertainment  to determine the feasibility of releasing "Sound Duel"-like original soundtrack albums in English-speaking markets.
 Although many of the self-theme songs aren't in the CD (such as the  Egyptian Gods  theme and " Orichalcos " theme) the tracks in this CD have been used throughout the entire second series (some of which were included in  Yu-Gi-Oh! GX  as well). Joel Douek, one of the series' composers, has also begun to post several of the missing tracks on his YouTube account. [1]
