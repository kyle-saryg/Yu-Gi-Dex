 Notes 
 
 ↑   Despite this card's written lore stating that it targets the co-linked monsters, this card seemed to affect the co-linked monsters without targeting them as it was able to affect " Transcode Talker " and " Powercode Talker " (who was co-linked to "Transcode") despite the effect of "Transcode" preventing itself and monsters co-linked to it from being targeted by the opponent's card effects.
