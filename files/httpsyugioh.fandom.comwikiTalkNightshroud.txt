 Duel Monster Spirits 
 Why does the article contain above-mentioned category? Nightshroud isn't a monster spirit - he is a spirit from  an another dimension , like  Astral , and also that dimension itself. -- 109.92.184.115  ( talk ) 23:02, March 30, 2011 (UTC)
 
 I believe that category is automatically added if the "corresponding card" parameter is used in the infobox. I'm not sure how to retain the use of the parameter and remove the cat. I'll ask someone about it.  Cheesedude  ( talk  •  contribs ) 01:01, March 31, 2011 (UTC) 
 I don't think we should list that as a corresponding card. His relationship to that card isn't the same as Duel Spirits to their cards. Also how do we know that that card is called "Nightshroud"/"Darkness" (ダークネス)? Its name is blank and there's  another card by that name  used by the same character. --  Deltaneos  ( talk ) 01:16, March 31, 2011 (UTC)
 True enough. I'll just remove the parameter.  Cheesedude  ( talk  •  contribs ) 01:34, March 31, 2011 (UTC) 
 Episode 159 
 Im not sure whether the duel from the mentioned episode belongs to his duel record. It looks like Atticus used Nightshroud's powers (i.e. mask) without being possessed by him. If so, then this duel should be removed. Anyone's opinion to this topic? -- 10.7.11.74  ( talk ) 21:13, May 4, 2011 (UTC)
 
 It was Atticus, but he specifically used " Red-Eyes Darkness Dragon ", which makes it Nightshroud's Deck. I can't recall if Atticus was actually taken over at any point in the Duel. If he wasn't, then perhaps it should be removed. But the cards should still be the Decklist. The Duel against Fujiwara is a completely different case though. Those cards shouldn't be listed.
