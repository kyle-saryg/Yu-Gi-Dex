       Kame Game inside     
 Kame Game  is the name of  Solomon Muto 's shop. The shop sells various games. Solomon,  Yugi's mother  and  Yugi  live here together. The word "kame" is Japanese for "turtle". In the dub, the shop is referred to simply as "Yugi's grandfather's game shop" and is never revealed to have a name, only having the word "game" written on the front.
 The shop also appears to be the home of the Muto family, having several upstairs bedrooms and other living quarters shown on occasion.
 
 Events 
 Yugi found the  Millennium Puzzle  in the basement of Kame Game when he was a child. Eight years later, he solved the puzzle in his bedroom, while under pressure to figure out what to do about  Ushio 's self-imposed bodyguard fees. (In the  first series anime , he didn't insert the last piece until he was at  school .) He then became possessed by  Yami Yugi  for the first time. [1] [2] 
 In the manga, Honda ( Tristan ) purchased a  love jigsaw puzzle  from Kame Game to give to  Miho Nosaka . [3]  In the first anime series,  Mayumi  purchased one for Jonouchi ( Joey ). [4] 
 Yugi took his friends here to show them his grandfather's " Blue-Eyes White Dragon "  Duel Monsters  card one day.  Seto Kaiba  also entered the store that same day and saw the card. Grandpa refused to sell or trade the card to him, but Kaiba later made other unsavory attempts to get the card afterwards. [5] 
 Kame Game had some rivalry when  Duke Devlin  ( his father  in the manga) opened the shop  Black Clown .
 A number of years later,  Jaden Yuki  and his friends visited Kame Game on a trip to Domino City. Solomon Muto was still running the shop, despite his advanced age.
