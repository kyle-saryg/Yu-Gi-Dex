Errata  (Japanese: エラッタ  Eratta ) are changes to any part of the text of a card (other than  Card Number ) that occur between  reprints . 
 Errata can be made to a card for a variety of reasons, including to fix mistakes, to update a card's terminology, or to clarify the behavior of a card so that its rulings are easier to understand (such as  Problem-Solving Card Text ). Some errata specifically modify the card's functionality itself, usually as a way to make the card less powerful in order to remove it from the  Forbidden  list.
 Players are not required to own the most recent erratum of a card, but they must always be played according to the latest erratum even if using an older copy of the card. Konami recommends using the most recent printing of a card, because that text is the most accurate. [1] 
 Some examples of errata are listed below.

 This is done when changing the card's name is undesirable, for marketing purposes. [2]

 Major mechanical changes 
 Beginning in March 2014, cards can receive errata that make major mechanical changes to their effects, rather than simply having errors or consistency corrected. The vast majority of these are to cards that are  Forbidden  at the time of the erratum, weakening the cards enough so that they no longer need to be Forbidden. [3] [4]
