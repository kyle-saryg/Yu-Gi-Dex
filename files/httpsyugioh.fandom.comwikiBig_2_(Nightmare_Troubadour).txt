 Big 2  is a character from  Yu-Gi-Oh! Nightmare Troubadour . He is the second of a 7-duel Boss battle that begins after the Beginners Cup. In dialogue he still refers to himself by his actual name,  Crump , but the game itself simply refers to him by his alias. The Player duels him in a Shadow Game and wins, causing him to presumably get sent to the Shadow Realm. His deck is overall similar in theme to his anime deck.
