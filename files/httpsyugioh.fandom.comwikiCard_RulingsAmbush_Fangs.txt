 OCG Rulings 
 The effect  targets  one face-up monster your opponent controls. [1] 
 Venom Counters  cannot be placed on a  face-down  monster, even by effects like those of " Venom Snake ", " Venom Boa ", " Venom Serpent ", " Ambush Fangs ", etc. [2] 
 Mentions in Other Rulings 
 When a monster's attack is negated by " Magic Cylinder ", the monster is not treated as having declared an attack, so the effect of " Red Dragon Archfiend " will still destroy it during the End Phase. [3] 
 Previously Official Rulings 
   These TCG rulings were issued by  Upper Deck Entertainment  and have since been deemed unofficial by Konami. [4]  They were previously considered official and can still be correct, as long as they follow the official gameplay rules, or unless Konami has issued a ruling that says otherwise. References:  [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] 
 
 This card’s effect to “…end the  Battle Phase .” causes play to enter the  End Step  of the  Battle Phase . The  Venom Counter  is placed on the monster that attacked, then any other effects that happen “at the end of the  Battle Phase ” are  resolved . 
 If you  activate  " Ambush Fangs ", and the attacking monster's attack is negated by a card chained to " Ambush Fangs  (" Negate Attack ", etc.), you cannot place a  Venom Counter  on the monster that attacked.
