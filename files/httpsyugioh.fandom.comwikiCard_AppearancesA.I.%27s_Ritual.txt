 Yu-Gi-Oh! VRAINS 
 Ai  uses this card during two  Master Duels : in  episode 111  against  Akira Zaizen  and  Blue Maiden , and in  episode 118  against  Playmaker . On both occasions, Ai adds this card from his Deck to his hand using the effect of " Hiyari @Ignister ", whose effect also adds " Water Leviathan @Ignister " from Ai's Deck to his hand. "Hiyari's" Level also becomes 4 due to  Tributing  a  Link 3   Link Monster  (" Fire Phoenix @Ignister ") to activate this effect. Ai then activates this card; on both occasions, since he controls a  WATER  monster in "Hiyari", he is able to Tribute monsters he controls as well as banish monsters for the  Ritual Summon  of "Water Leviathan". He Tributes "Hiyari" and banishes " Pikari @Ignister " from his Graveyard as part of this effect.
