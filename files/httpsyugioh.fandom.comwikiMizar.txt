 Design 
 Appearance 
       Full view of Mizar's true form.     
 While in his  true  form, Mizar has a decidedly alien mask-like face with a wing prodding out the left side, and piercing blue eyes, similar to  Vetrix . He wears white arm guards, as well as boots of the same color adorned with white gems and a bronze-colored sarong with white plating that have green gems in addition to having yellow skin, horned shoulders, and long blond-orange hair. He also wears his  Barian Emblem  hanging from his chest in the shape of a caduceus. He is also the second tallest of the Emperors after  Girag .
 
         Mizar's human form.         Full view of Mizar's human form.         
 In his human form, Mizar's hair is lighter and has his wing-shaped extension as a part of his hair. He also wears a long golden earring on the left side of his hair, attached to a smaller wing. He also has red markings on his cheeks and above his eyes. Unlike Girag and  Alito , Mizar does not wear a school uniform; he instead wears white pants and long-sleeved shirt underneath a gray vest with long gray gloves, both of which have wings. In addition, his Barian Emblem appears as a pendant and his boots are gray and adorned with green gems, which are also seen on his vest. Following his revival after  Yuma Tsukumo  and  Astral 's ceremonial Duel, Mizar attends  Heartland Academy  as a third-year student, thus wearing the standard blue-lined uniform, blue pants and brown shoes.
 
         Concept art of Mizar     
 In his past life, he lacked his facial marks and has a golden necklace, a large gold shoulder plate on his left shoulder with a golden gauntlet, a golden wing-shaped armband on his right arm, white robes underneath with a diamond pattern on the left side of the torso and golden stripes on the other and was tied with a green sash at the midsection. Mizar also carried a sword.
 
 Personality 
 Mizar is prideful and arrogant as being a " Galaxy-Eyes " master, shown when he obtained his  Over-Hundred Number  through a  blank card , despite the  monster's  tremendous power. Due to this he eventually develops a rivalry with  Kite Tenjo , being the only other known "Galaxy-Eyes" master in order to prove who is the superior. [6]  Unlike  Girag  and  Alito , Mizar is shown to be straightforward and serious, as when he arrived on  Earth , he began his mission right away - giving Girag and Alito their  Barian Sphere Cubes , and then moving on to find  Yuma Tsukumo  - whereas the other two remained distracted with their antics, to which he chastises the two for letting them get in the way of their goal. However, he seems to enjoy showcasing his powers, as Alito stated his entrance was "overly flashy". [7] 
 However, his pride has shown to be somewhat fragile, as he was extremely furious at  Trey  and  Quinton  for stealing his " Number 107: Galaxy-Eyes Tachyon Dragon " and blocking his attempt to summon its  upgraded  form, clenching his fists while claiming it was the first time that he had received such an insult and berating the siblings. He is also somewhat hasty when he is angered, as shown when he used  Chaos Draw  to draw " Rank-Up-Magic - The Seventh One ", before realizing it was useless to him in his current situation. [3] 
 Due to his arrogance, Mizar is shown to be obstinate at times, as he refused to believe from both  Dumon  and  Jinlon  that he and his comrades were humans once, although this subsides if evidence is given against him. He was also somewhat reluctant to abandon his second Duel with Kite when the power released by  ZEXAL II  damaged  Sargasso . In his final Duel against Kite, he stubbornly refused to believe that his "Tachyon Dragon" was part of a curse created by  Don Thousand , and that his dragon would not betray him. [8] 
 In spite of his arrogance, Mizar does show a level of concern and respect for his fellow  Barians , as revealed when he saw Alito injured. [9]  He showed much anger and hatred towards  Vector  for his mocking of Alito and Girag and had to be physically restrained by Dumon to prevent him from attacking Vector. [10]  He also maintains a strong sense of honor, much like Alito, refusing to use " Sargasso Lighthouse " in his rematch with Kite, calling it a "coward's card". [11]  In his past life, he was fiercely loyal and held a strong friendship with his dragon. [12]  Mizar has also displayed a degree of respect and mercy for his foes as he allowed  Quinton  and  Trey  to say their goodbyes to Yuma before defeating them and sending them to the  Barian World , referring to them as "proud brothers". [1]  Likewise he also mourned Kite's death at the end of their final Duel despite their fierce, bitter rivalry. [8] 
 
 Abilities 
         Mizar firing an energy ball at  Tori .     
 Mizar can control  Tachyon Dragon , something that other  Barians  fear him for. Using a  blank card , he can even absorb it in order to use it in Duels. He is capable of teleportation via portals just like other Barians. Furthermore, he can produce energy balls to use as weapons, though they do not cause permanent harm. [7]  Like  Vector , he was shown to be able to generate energy waves in order to push other people back. [12] 
 He can also create a barrier that can protect him from harm, as seen when  Anna  fired her cannon at him. He's also shown to be athletic enough to jump from building to building, being capable of easily following a vehicle in movement. [2] 
 He can surround his entire body with a golden aura that protects him from the vacuum of space, allowing him to face  Kite  on the moon. [13] 
 
 Etymology 
 Mizar is named after  Zeta Ursae Majoris , also known as Mizar, a star located in the  Big Dipper  asterism. His name in the Japanese version is a corrupted form of that star's name.
 
 
 Biography 
 History 
         Mizar as a child     
         Mizar in his past life, with his dragon.     
 When Mizar was a young child, raiders attacked his village and killed everyone, including his parents, (in the dub, they were kidnapped) but he was able to run away. He eventually ended up in a desert where he was on the verge of dying until  Jinlon  rescued him. The two formed a strong bond. [8]  He also obtained " Number 46: Dragluon " as a result of his bonds with his dragon [8] . Since then, Mizar became a mighty dragon tamer who protected his land alongside Jinlon. When a secret agent posing as a wandering shaman blamed the dragon for a deluge that flooded the village, Mizar defended him from the rioting villagers and even offered his life so the villagers would believe him. They were then ambushed by a neighboring army, which killed Mizar and Jinlon and took over the land. [12]  While he lay dying the wandering shaman, revealed to be  Don Thousand , appeared, stating he could not let his dragon soul go to the  Astral World . Thousand embedded " Number 107: Galaxy-Eyes Tachyon Dragon " in Mizar's heart and filled it with hatred [14] , (In the English Dub, Don Thousand also falsified his memories, making him believed that he betrayed Jinlon and was the cause of his death). 
 
         Mizar along with  Dumon ,  Alito  and  Girag .     
 Mizar was reincarnated as one of the  Seven Barian Emperors , as his soul was one that was connected to a  Mythyrian "Number"  card, which had sealed Thousand's power. [15]  Mizar had no memory of his previous life, due to the " Over-Hundred Number " that he received from Don Thousand. [8]  The Emperors plotted to destroy the  Astral World . Due to both worlds being made of energy, they could not interact. As Barians cannot take "Numbers" directly, they exploited humans such as  Vetrix  and  Dr. Faker . [16] 
 
 Yu-Gi-Oh! ZEXAL II 
 Barian Invasion 
         Mizar receiving the  Barian Sphere Cubes .     
 After  Dumon  sent  Alito  to  Earth , Mizar questioned whether Alito was really capable. He insisted that if they cannot defeat  Yuma Tsukumo  and obtain the " Numbers ", the  Barian  World has no future. He was perplexed how Dumon could entrust such a mission to a "simpleton" like Alito. Dumon responded that putting aside everything else about him, Alito was a reliable  Duelist  and even if he failed, his failure would still bring them more information. [17] 
 
         Mizar arriving on Earth.     
 After the constant failures of Girag and Alito, Dumon decided to send Mizar to Earth in order to Duel Yuma. He gave Mizar three  Barian Sphere Cubes , two of which he was to give to Girag and Alito. He then disappeared into a portal and appeared in an unknown realm and approached a  giant dragon  which he absorbed into a  blank card . He then went to Earth, creating storms in the process. Seeing this, Girag and Alito investigated and recognized Mizar straight away as he emerged from the crater he created upon impact. Mizar gave the two their Barian Sphere Cubes, then disappeared before they had a chance to talk. Mizar spied on Yuma and  Tori  near the  Duel Sanctuary  and fired an  energy ball  at Tori, knocking her over. He then activated his Barian Sphere Cube, forcing Yuma into a  Duel  with his "Numbers" on the line. Yuma managed to get a head start by  Xyz Summoning  his " Number 39: Utopia " but Mizar countered with " Number 107: Galaxy-Eyes Tachyon Dragon ". [7] 
 
         Mizar Summoning " Neo Galaxy-Eyes Tachyon Dragon ".     
 Mizar ordered his "Tachyon Dragon" to attack "Utopia",  negating  its  effect  in the process, which resulted in its  destruction . The force of the attack sent Yuma flying into the Barian Sphere Cube, with him falling unconscious due to the blow. As this occurred,  Kite  appeared with  Orbital 7 , challenging Mizar to a Duel between " Galaxy-Eyes " users which Mizar accepted. After Kite Xyz Summoned " Neo Galaxy-Eyes Photon Dragon " and destroyed "Tachyon Dragon", Mizar  shed his human disguise , revealing his true form. He then Xyz Summoned his " Number C " through the use of " Rank-Up-Magic Barian's Force ", resulting in " Number C107: Neo Galaxy-Eyes Tachyon Dragon ". However, due to the sheer power of the monster, the Duel was interrupted as the Barian Sphere began to collapse under the pressure the monster generated. Mizar then returned to his human disguise and told Kite that he will be the one to control both "Galaxy-Eyes" monsters, and then retreated. [6] 
 
         Mizar attempting to attack Vector.     
 After Alito was injured by  Ray Shadows , Girag called Mizar to find out who attacked him. Mizar suggested it had to do with Yuma Tsukumo. Girag wanted to take revenge on "Ray", but Mizar did not support this, pointing out that they have only one remaining Barian's Sphere Cube and they must use it to obtain Yuma's "Numbers". He then departed with Alito to the Barian World for help through a portal. [9]  After Yuma and "Ray" defeated Girag, Mizar and Dumon were surprised when Vector appeared, as they thought he was killed when  Dr. Faker  was defeated. When Vector joked about how Alito and Girag lost, Mizar became angered and tried to attack him, but was stopped by Dumon. The three discussed what to do next about Yuma and their hunt for the "Numbers", and Mizar ultimately agreed to let Vector handle Yuma for now. [10] 
 
         Mizar vs. Kite.     
 Vector's plan eventually resulted in Yuma, Astral and their allies boarding the  Different Dimension Airship  and attempting to reach the  Barian World  to rescue Ray. The  Barians  sent monsters after the ship, and though the occupants fought them off, the ship crashed at " Sargasso the Different Dimension Battlefield ", where Mizar waited with Vector and Dumon. Mizar Dueled Kite again and allowed him the first  turn , and watched Kite take  damage  from the effect of "Sargasso" when he Summoned " Starliege Lord Galaxion ". [18]  Kite proceeded to Summon " Galaxy-Eyes Phpton Dragon ", but Mizar refused to give himself an advantage by using " Sargasso Lighthouse " like Dumon and Vector, calling it a "coward's card". When Mizar Summoned "Tachyon Dragon", he took damage from "Sargasso" as a result. [11]  When Kite Summoned "Neo Photon", Mizar activated " Neutrino Dowsing " to  send  " Rank-Up-Magic Barian's Force " from his  Deck  to the  Graveyard  and use its effect to Summon "Neo Tachyon". [19]  After the power surge of  ZEXAL II  caused "Sargasso" to self-destruct, Mizar was ordered by Dumon to stop his Duel and retreat. Mizar initially objected to this, but as his platform began to crumble, he complied and left the field. [20] 
 
 Mythyrian Numbers War 
 Mizar and  Dumon  returned to the  Barian World  to find it crumbling around them and took it as a sign that their time was ending.  Vector  reappeared and they blamed him for the failure of their previous plans, with Vector retorting that without those plans, they would be even worse off. This enraged Mizar, saying that Vector will face his "Galaxy-Eyes" wrath, but Dumon stopped him from attacking Vector. Vector told them that  Astral 's powers are increasing - if he recovered his memories, the Barian World would be finished; after all, he defeated  Don Thousand  years ago. Vector told them of the  Mythyrian "Numbers"  hidden on  Earth  and suggested they take them before Yuma does, while introducing  Mr. Heartland . Heartland had been turned into to a fly, but told them of information he gleaned while working for Dr. Faker - the twenty-three locations on Earth where portals to other dimensions can appear. Mizar and Dumon agreed to search for them and immediately departed. [5] 
 Later, Vector called Mizar and Dumon back to the Barian World and informed them that  Alito  and  Girag  had awoken, much to their surprise. Mizar was angered by Alito's arrogant attitude towards him, but their conversation was cut off when Mr. Heartland interrupted them, revealing the next "Number" location and that Yuma might be aiming for it as well. Mizar looked on as Alito left to retrieve it. [21] 
 
         Mizar arrives at the fourth set of ruins.     
 Later, Mizar reported to Dumon that he had located another  Number ruins  and noticed that Dumon seems distracted by something. When Mizar questioned him, Dumon shared his theory that the  Barians  had once lived as humans, but Mizar rejected the theory and departed for the ruins he had just located. Upon arriving, Mizar heard the roar of a dragon that he apparently recognized. [22]  After  Kite  won his Duel against  Jinlon , Mizar secretly listened to the legend of the ruins that included him. Unable to accept that he was once a "lowly human", he attacked his former dragon partner and challenged Kite to settle things. Unfortunately, the force of the "Neo Galaxy-Eyes" monsters began to destroy the ruins, so Mizar decided to retreat, swearing to defeat Kite and his new dragon. [12] 
 Later, Mizar met with Dumon on Earth, who asked him if Jinlon said that he used to be human. Mizar confirmed that he did, but that he had no intentions of believing it as he is a proud Barian warrior. Dumon claimed he felt the same, but decided to continue to check up on the ruins, hoping to find the legends of  Nash  and  Marin , as finding them could shift the situation to the Barians' advantage. [23]  In the Barian World, Mizar spoke to Dumon once again about the ruins and came to terms with the fact that the Barians were once humans. When Dumon announced that he was going to get Nash and Marin by the ruins' legends, Mizar was baffled that they could be  Shark  and  Rio Kastle . [24] 
 Later, Mizar was called to an emergency meeting between the  Seven Barian Emperors . There, he witnessed Vector discover that  Nash  and  Marin  were still alive. [25]  Nash granted each of the Barian Emperors new powers, then consented to Vector's plan of attacking Earth now. [26] 
 
 Barian Emperor Onslaught 
         Mizar Duels  Anna  and  Nelson .     
 After  Mr. Heartland  was defeated, the  Seven Barian Emperors  arrived together on  Earth  in front of  Yuma . Together, they  Barian Battlemorphed . Yuma was rendered unable to Duel when the  Emperor's Key  reacted with  Nash 's  Barian Emblem .  Roku  and  Kaze  arrived and pelted the Emperors with smoke bombs, allowing Yuma's group to escape. The Emperors gave chase, with Mizar being attacked by  Anna Kaboom , shot by her cannon. He blocked the blow, with Anna telling him she won't let him lay a finger on Yuma no matter what. Mizar responded that he won't forgive anyone that gets in his way. Anna claimed that unforgiveness was her line, but was interpreted by another figure saying the same thing. It was  Nelson Andrews  still acting in his Star Sparrow persona, saying it was time for another "grand feast of justice". The two joined together to confront Mizar. Later in the Duel, Mizar performed a  Chaos Draw  alongside the other Emperors. [2]  This allowed him to use " Rank-Up-Magic - The Seventh One " to bring out " Number C107: Neo Galaxy-Eyes Tachyon Dragon " and defeat both of his opponents. As their souls departed for the Barian World, he simply said "farewell". [27]  After Nash's victory over  Quattro , the Emperors regrouped and Nash ordered them to split up and pursue the remaining "Number" holders - Yuma,  Astral ,  Kite ,  Trey  and  Quinton . Mizar went after Yuma and Astral, only to find his way blocked by Trey and Quinton, who refused to divulge their whereabouts, saying he'd have to defeat them first. He asked if they wished to become prey for his "Neo Tachyon", but they still refused to move and Mizar prepared to Duel them. [28] 
 
         Mizar cannot play " Rank-Up-Magic - The Seventh One ".     
 Quinton informed Mizar that he had been the one who taught Kite how to Duel, which seemed to intrigue him. Quinton Summoned " Number 9: Dyson Sphere ", whose size alerted  Marin  and  Dumon  to the Duel's start. The two quickly made their way there, but Mizar told them he was fine and that they should go search for Yuma and Kite instead. Quinton and Trey used the power of the bracelets'  crests  to generate a  Sphere Field , which trapped the three Barians there. Mizar insisted his allies still not interfere and quickly brought out " Number 107: Galaxy-Eyes Tachyon Dragon ", but was unable to Rank it Up due to Quinton's " Spell Summon Stopper ". Although "Tachyon Dragon" destroyed "Dyson Sphere", Mizar played into his opponents' hands with " Tachyon Flare Wing ", ultimately resulting in "Tachyon Dragon" being  equipped  to Trey's " Number C6: Chronomaly Chaos Atlandis ". Mizar called this the first time he had been humiliated and used "Chaos Draw" to draw "The Seventh One". He intended to Rank-Up "Tachyon Dragon", but quickly realized he could not, as it was not on his  field  or in his  Graveyard  or  Extra Deck , but equipped to his opponent's monster. [3]  Admitting he had underestimated them, he played defensively using " Heliosphere Dragon " and two  Trap Cards . This was enough to survive Quinton's combo of "Chaos Atlandis" and " Number C9: Chaos Dyson Sphere ", though his  Life Points  remaining at only 1. He also recovered "Tachyon Dragon" this way, enabling him to Summon "Neo Tachyon". Despite Quinton's and Trey's own Trap Cards, the effect of "Neo Tachyon" rewound time and rendered them useless. Seeing there was no way out, Quinton activated a communications link with Yuma and told both him and Mizar where Kite had gone. He had discovered a  tablet detailing a legend  regarding the "Galaxy-Eyes" dragons. Believing them connected to the  Numeron Code , he journeyed to the moon. After allowing Trey and Quinton to say their good-byes to Yuma, Mizar ordered his attacks, defeating the brothers and sending them to the Barian World, saying "farewell, proud brothers." After conversing with Dumon and Marin, Mizar made for the moon himself. [1] .
 
         Mizar obtains " Number 100: Numeron Dragon ".     
When Mizar arrived on the moon, he had a conversation with Kite, who revealed the origin of the " Galaxy-Eyes " and their connection to the  Numeron Code  to him. After the conversation, Mizar commenced  Barian Battlemorph  and challenged Kite to a Duel to prove himself as "the strongest Dragon Master". [13]  After "Neo Tachyon" and " Number 46: Dragluon " destroyed each other and  Jinlon  revealed his true past life, Mizar reverted back to his human form. He then angrily Battlemorphed back to his Barian form, affirming that he will not believe that "Tachyon Dragon" would betray him and he will defeat Kite. [14] . Mizar and Kite continued the Duel, with the former brutally assaulting Kite, which caused him and  Orbital 7  to sustain severe damage. While Kite lay on the ground, exhausted, he made a connection with Yuma, Astral and  Tori Meadows  so they could watch the Duel. At this point, Kite and his friends asked Mizar to cease fighting for  Don Thousand , who had been manipulating him, but Mizar quickly claimed that he was fighting to protect his fellow Barians. Yuma and Astral told him that there was nobody to protect because Vector betrayed and absorbed most of his companions. They also confirmed that "Neo Tachyon" was Don Thousand's curse upon him, much to Mizar's horror and disbelief. Kite cut the conversation short, claiming he will free Mizar from his curse, and the two resumed their Duel.          Mizar sobs at his rival's demise.      Kite brought back " Number 62: Galaxy-Eyes Prime Photon Dragon " to battle with "Neo Tachyon". As the monsters clashed, Kite questioned Mizar on why he was a dragon tamer and theorized that he trusted dragons but was incapable of trusting people. Mizar demanded Kite to not take pity on him. Kite quickly claimed it was not pity, but admiration, since he recognized Mizar as the true Dragon Master. Kite further clarified that he just used his "Galaxy-Eyes" because he wanted to protect his family, but his monster allowed him to meet all his friends and trust people. Kite asked Mizar to tell him that the next time they met to tell him what happened to him. He activated the effect of "Prime Photon Dragon" and defeated Mizar. Mizar witnessed the awakening of " Number 100: Numeron Dragon " and walked towards Kite, who lay beaten on the ground. Kite gave "Numeron Dragon" to Mizar, asking him to walk the path he believed in, before dying as a result of his injuries. Mizar mourned for Kite and angrily swore revenge on Don Thousand. [8] 
         Mizar's death.     
 Though he had lost the ability to use his "Over-Hundred Number" and take Barian form, Mizar was still able to travel back to the Barian World, intent on confronting Don Thousand. Upon arriving, he gave "Numeron Dragon" to Yuma and then challenged Don Thousand. The two Dueled, but Thousand used " Numeron Network " to manipulate the Duel, resulting in Mizar performing a  One Turn Kill  on himself with " Card of the Dragon King " in lieu of  drawing  the Duel with " Dragon King's Demise ". Before dying, he urged Nash and Yuma not to allow the sacrifices of everyone to be vain and defeat Thousand. [29] 
 
         Mizar's spirit appears with Nash.     
 During Nash's Duel with Yuma, Mizar's soul appeared to support Nash alongside those of the other Emperors after Nash overlaid their " Chaos Over-Hundred Numbers " to create " CXyz Barian Hope ". [30] 
 
         Mizar at Heartland Academy as a third year student.     
 After Astral obtained the  Numeron Code , Mizar was brought back to life as a human, alongside his fellow Barian Emperors. Mizar enrolled into Heartland Academy as a third-year student. He then joined Yuma in coming to Astral's aid when the Astral World faced a new crisis. [31] 
 
 
 Number Hunting 
         Mizar with his " Over-Hundred Number " and its  upgraded form .     
 Mizar's " Over-Hundred Number " is " Number 107: Galaxy-Eyes Tachyon Dragon " [7] , with its upgraded " Chaos " form being " Number C107: Neo Galaxy-Eyes Tachyon Dragon ". [6] 
 Mizar acquired " Number 6: Chronomaly Atlandis " and " Number 33: Chronomaly Machu Mech " from  Trey  and " Number 9: Dyson Sphere " from  Quinton  after defeating them. This may have also netted him the upgraded forms of two of them " Number C6: Chronomaly Chaos Atlandis " and " Number C9: Chaos Dyson Sphere ". [1] 
 After losing to  Kite , which resulted in the latter's death, Mizar acquired " Number 100: Numeron Dragon ", along with " Number 62: Galaxy-Eyes Prime Photon Dragon " and " Number 46: Dragluon ". [8]  He later gave "Numeron Dragon" to  Yuma . [29]  His remaining "Numbers" were taken by Thousand when the latter absorbed him. [29] 
 
 Relationships 
 Kite Tenjo 
 As  Kite  and Mizar wield " Galaxy-Eyes "  monsters , they share a fierce rivalry with one another. Both are determined to defeat one another in a Duel to find out who the true "Galaxy-Eyes" master is. During their third Duel, Kite attempted to show Mizar his true identity through " Number 46: Dragluon ", but Mizar continuously ignored it. Mizar later mourned Kite's death after their Duel and accepted " Number 100: Numeron Dragon " from him before he passed on, and swore revenge against  Don Thousand  to avenge his rival. After their revival, the two became allies with Yuma in his fight to save the  Astral World .
 
 Deck 
 Mizar uses a  " Tachyon Dragon " Deck , focusing on his secondary ace card, " Number 107: Galaxy-Eyes Tachyon Dragon ", Summoned using  Dragon - Type   monsters  that can either  Special Summon  themselves or modify their  Levels  to 8. Once it is Summoned, he focuses on replenishing its  Overlay Units  through cards such as " Energy Attractor " and " Instant Overlay ". He later gains access to " Rank-Up-Magic - The Seventh One " through the  Chaos Draw , allowing him to  Rank-Up  "Tachyon Dragon" from his  Graveyard  or  Extra Deck . Mizar can also utilize " Galaxy Stealth Dragon " along with " Dragon King's Demise " in an attempt to perform a  One Turn Kill .
