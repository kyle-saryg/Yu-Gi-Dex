 "It's in the Cards, Part 2" , known as  "Chaos Xyz Change! Light of Hope, Hope Ray!!"  in the Japanese version, is the eighteenth episode of the  Yu-Gi-Oh! ZEXAL  anime. It first aired in Japan on August 8, 2011 and in the United States on April 7, 2012.
 The duel between  Yuma  and  Fortuno  continues. Fortuno pushes Yuma into a corner as he summons " Number 11: Big Eye ". Despite  Astral 's acceptance of defeat, Yuma's unwillingness of surrendering leads the two to unlock a  new power !
 
 Featured Duel: Yuma Tsukumo vs. Fortuno 
 Duel continues from  the previous episode .
 Turn 4: Yuma 
 Yuma   draws  " Kurivolt " and subsequently  Normal Summons  it ( 1/300/200) in Attack Position. He then  activates  its  effect  twice, to  detach  both of the  Overlay Units  of " Number 16: Shock Master " ("Shock Master": 2 → 0 ORU) and  Special Summon  two " Kurivolt Tokens " ( 1/300/200 each) in  Attack Position . 
 Yuma activates " Voltage Summon " to  Tribute  all "Kurivolt Tokens" he  controls  and Special Summon " Ganbara Knight " and " Kagetokage " (as both monsters' Levels are at most 4) in  Attack Position  with their ATK and DEF reduced to 0 and their effects negated ("Ganbara Knight":  4/0/1800 → 0/0) ("Kagetokage":  4/1100/1500 → 0/0). 
 Yuma overlays "Kagetokage" and "Ganbara Knight" in order to  Xyz Summon  " Number 39: Utopia " ( 4/2500/2000, ORU: 2) in Attack Position. "Utopia"  attacks  and  destroys  "Shock Master" (Fortuno: 4000 → 3800 LP)."Kurivolt" attacks  directly  (Fortuno: 3800 → 3500 LP). Yuma  Sets  two cards.
 Turn 5: Fortuno 
 
                 No. 11 Big Eye   "Big Eye" is Summoned.     
 Fortuno draws. As Yuma controls an  Xyz Monster  and he controls no monsters, Fortuno Special Summons " Rainbow Shaman " ( 7/0/0) from his  hand  in Attack Position via its own effect. He then activates " Xyz Plant " to target "Rainbow Shaman" and  move  "Xyz Plant" to his  Monster Zone  (0/0) as a monster with the same Level as "Rainbow Shaman" in Attack Position. Fortuno overlays "Rainbow Shaman" and "Xyz Plant" in order to Xyz Summon " Number 11: Big Eye " ( 7/2600/2000) in Attack Position. Fortuno activates the effect of "Big Eye" to detach an Overlay Unit ("Big Eye": 2 → 1 ORU) and take control of "Utopia", though "Big Eye" cannot attack this turn. "Utopia" attacks and destroys "Kurivolt" (Yuma: 3500 → 1300 LP). Fortuno Sets a card.
 Turn 6: Yuma 
Yuma draws " Dododo Warrior ", but Fortuno activates his  face-down  " Freezing Dance ", which stops both players from Summoning or setting any monsters from their hand as long as it remains  face-up , but it will destroy itself during Yuma's second  End Phase .
 Turn 7: Fortuno 
Fortuno draws "Twilight Dance". "Big Eye" attacks directly, but Yuma activates his face-down " Nitwit Outwit " to send the "Dododo Warrior" in his hand to the  Graveyard  and reduce the  Battle Damage  he would take by the sent monster's ATK (Yuma: 1300 → 1000 LP). "Utopia" attacks directly, but Yuma activates his face-down " Xyz Weight " to reduce the ATK of "Utopia" by 800 for each Overlay Unit  attached  to it ("Utopia": 2500 → 900 ATK). The direct attack continues (Yuma: 1000 → 100 LP). Fortuno activates " Twilight Dance ", preventing both players from Special Summoning monsters from their Graveyard. On Fortuno's End Phase, the effect of "Xyz Weight" expires ("Utopia": 900 → 2500 ATK).
 Turn 8: Yuma 
 
                 CNo. 39 Aspiration Emperor - Hope Ray   "Utopia Ray" is Summoned.     
 Yuma draws " Comeback " and subsequently activates it to target "Utopia" and take control of it as it was a monster he owned. Yuma performs  Chaos Xyz Evolution  and overlays "Utopia" and its Overlay Units in order to Xyz Summon " Chaos Number 39: Utopia Ray " ( 4/2500/2000, ORU: 3) in Attack Position. Yuma then activates the effect of "Utopia Ray" three times to detach all of its Overlay Units ("Utopia Ray": 3 → 0 ORU) and increase its ATK by 500 for each Overlay Unit as well as subsequently decrease the ATK of "Big Eye" by 1000 for each Overlay Unit detached ("Utopia Ray": 2500 → 4000 ATK, "Big Eye": 2600 → 0 ATK). "Utopia Ray" attacks and destroys "Big Eye" (Fortuno: 3500 → 0 LP).
 
 Differences in adaptations 
 In the dub, when  Astral  make his "Observation Number 13", he also makes an extra "Observation Number 13a". 
 Fortuno 's scream heard at the end after losing to  Kite  is removed. 
 Yuma  explaining how he knew the Kite on the throne was not the real Kite is different in the dub compared to the original. In the original, it was because Kite was against actually inflicting pain to others. In the dub, it was because Kite prefers to get " Numbers " by himself rather than use followers or minions to get them for him.
