 Lyrics (TV Size) 
 Rōmaji English 
 
 Asa kara saihu wa otosushi kaidan fumi hazusu 
Totsuzen no ame ni fuku wa bisho nure 
 
Jinsei yama ari tani aritte tani darake janaika! 
Koko de makecha nanimo kawaranai 
 
Kyou no boku wa sukoshi demo iketetakai? 
Nayandeiru sugata wa iketenai!? 
 
Kono toki wo shunkan wo nogashitara nidoto konai yo 
Koukai nante nai yorimo nasakenainda 
 
LET'S JOY! 
O senchi wa nansensu! 
Nandomo nandomo nandomo ataman nakade 
Onnaji souzou bakkari kuri kaesu yori 
 
LET'S JOY! 
Kirifuda wa pendulum! 
Donna ni donna ni donna ni ochikondemo 
Minna de waiwai waraeba kawareu keshiki 
 
Musukashii koko janaiyo (hora kimi mo egao) 
Tanoshinda mono no kaachisa!
 
 
 
 I dropped my wallet this morning and missed a step on the stairs. 
I got my clothes soaked by some sudden showers. 
 
Life's full of up and downs but hasn't it only being down recently! 
I can't give up here or nothing will change. 
 
Don't I look pretty cool today? 
Don't I look cool wondering about things like this!? 
 
This moment, this instant, if I let it go, it'll never come again. 
There's nothing worse than regretting that! 
 
LET'S JOY! 
Being sentimental, is nonsense! 
Na matter how many times I repeat it over and over and over again inside my head 
Instead of just imagining these things over and over I should 
 
LET'S JOY! 
My trump card, is pendulum! 
No matter how down down down I feel, 
I can change it by just smiling with everyone! 
 
It's not hard to do at all, (Come on you smile too) 
As long as you're having fun, you're winning!
