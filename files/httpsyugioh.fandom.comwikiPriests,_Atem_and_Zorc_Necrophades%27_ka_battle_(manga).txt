 Events 
 Prior 
       Zorc , awakened by  Akhenaden     
 Zorc Necrophades  tempted  Akhenaden  into creating the  Millennium Items , in a ploy to release himself from the shadows. Zorc knew that by giving people the power the summon monsters that they would traffic demons and with that power the ambitious ones would fight among themselves. He counted on this, knowing it would lead one of them to gather the items in one place to resurrect him. [1] 
 In revenge for the  Kul Elna massacre ,  Bakura, King of Thieves  corrupted Akhenaden, by sealing some his evil in the  Millennium Eye , worn by Akhenaden. [2]  As Zorc had willed, [1]  this led to Akhenaden inserting the seven Millennium Items into the  Tablet of the Pharaoh's Memories  to complete the Dark Contract to summon Zorc. [3] [4] 
 Per the contract, Zorc bestowed some of his power upon Akhenaden, turning him into the High Priest of Darkness. [1] 
 
 Battle 
 Atem,  Shada ,  Seto ,  Isis ,  Siamun Muran ,  Mana  and an army of soldiers faced off against Zorc. Atem, Mana, Seto and Isis called upon their ka,  Mahado the Dark Magician ,  Dark Magician Girl ,  Duos  and  Spiria  respectively. [5] 
 Mana got the Dark Magician Girl to share her power with Mahado and the two attacked Zorc with "Black Burning Magic". Despite hitting him head on, the attack had little effect. Zorc then launched an attack, which hit numerous soldiers and killed Shada as he attempted to protect Atem. [6] 
 
       The High Priest of Darkness raises the  Army of the Dead .     
 With only two High Priests remaining and Atem too weak to summon any of the  three gods , the High Priest of Darkness highlighted the futility of fighting Zorc to Seto. Seto realized that the Shadow Priest was Akhenaden and demanded to know why he had betrayed them. Akhenaden paralleled the look on Seto's face to when Seto first saw him with the Millennium Eye and revealed that he was Seto's father. With Akhenaden siding with Zorc, Seto could not see him as anything other than an enemy. He ordered Duos to attack, but Akhenaden destroyed it with his shadow magic and claimed that Seto's illusions of justice would die with his ka. [6] 
 The Dark Magician and Dark Magician Girl, rushed to Seto's aid. Akhenaden then raised the  Army of the Dead  to fight them and the pharaoh's men. The magicians began fighting off the army, but ultimately lacked the power to take them all on and a number of soldiers were killed. [6] 
 
       Akhenaden takes Seto away.     
 Akhenaden teleported himself and Seto to  the palace , in the hopes of getting Seto to assimilate Kisara's  ka [6] [7] 
 Siamun, took the  Millennium Key , he had once given to Shada, back from Shada's deceased body, [6]  and used  its power to summon  Exodia , the Demon God of the Palace, from its five tablets. Exodia instantly destroyed the Army of the Dead with a single "Exodia Blaze" attack. [7] 
 
         Zorc defeats  Exodia .     
 Siamun ordered Exodia to increase to maximum fire and target Zorc. [7]  Zorc became engulfed in flames, but remained unrelenting. Zorc launched with a "Dark Phenomenon" attack, splitting Exodia down the middle. Its destruction drained Siamun's  ba , killing him. [8] 
 Atem tried fighting Zorc, but his ba fell too low to support his ka, causing the Dark Magician to disappear. [8] 
 The battle eventually ended when Atem sealed his soul [5]  and Zorc's [9]  in the  Millennium Puzzle . [5] 
 
 Aftermath 
 The Millennium Puzzle, containing Atem [5]  and Zorc's [9]  souls was broken apart, at some point. This caused Atem's soul and memories to be broken with it. Among other things, he forgot his name, which was lost in history. [5] 
 
 Shadow RPG 
 In the  Shadow RPG ,  Dark Yugi  and  Dark Bakura  replayed the events of Atem and Zorc's life, through a tabletop game. This battle was among the events they replayed.
 In the RPG, Dark Bakura had  hourglasses , he could use borrow powers from the sleeping Zorc. He used one to freeze time, immobilizing the bodies of Dark Yugi's team, after  Bakura, King of Thieves  was  defeated  at  Kul Elna . This allowed  Akhenaden  to take the Millennium Items and insert them into the tablet. [1] 
 With Zorc resurrected, Dark Bakura's team; Zorc and the High Priest of Darkness were at maximum  ba , while Dark Yugi's team; Atem and the priests had taken significant damage and could not move due to the hourglass. Since Dark Bakura did not like one-sided games, he informed Dark Yugi that his friends existed in the game world as non-player characters (NPCs) and could be his only chance at winning. [1] 
 
         Dark Yugi  uses the Seto card to invoke Akhenaden's parental feelings.     
 Dark Yugi pointed out that as a role player, Dark Bakura should have his team members act in character. And as such, the High Priest of Darkness should have the safety of his son,  Seto , at heart and stop Zorc attacking. Dark Bakura was willing to stop Zorc attacking, in exchange for Dark Yugi's Seto card. Dark Yugi refused to make the trade, so Dark Bakura had Zorc dismiss Akhenaden's parental emotions as irrelevant to his cause and attack anyway. [10] 
 
         Hasan  protects the pharaoh and the priests     
 The resurrection of Zorc prompted the NPC,  Bobasa , to change to  Hasan . [1]  Hasan stressed the importance of the other NPCs,  Yugi ,  Jonouchi ,  Anzu  and  Honda , finding Atem's name, which would be written in  his tomb . He then flew to Kul Elna where he shielded Atem and the High Priests from Zorc's attack. [10] 
 While still immobilized by the time freeze, Atem questioned Akhenaden selling his soul to Zorc. In his response, Akhenaden attacked him with a demonstration of the shadow power it had given him. During the attack, the time freeze ended and  Mahado , the Dark Magician, intervened with used his "Afterworld Warp" spell, which absorbed the attack. [11] 
 Yugi, Jonouchi, Anzu and Honda traveled to the pharaoh's tomb, where they encountered a portion of Dark Bakura's soul. [12]  This Dark Bakura  faced  Yugi in a  Shadow Game  of  Duel Monsters , [11]  which Yugi won. [13] 
 The Dark Bakura at the RPG table then used the last hourglass to activate Zorc's "Natural Catastrophe" ability, causing the World of Memories to sink into the sand, suspecting this would kill Yugi and his friends before they could find Atem's name. [5]  However they succeeded in finding the name and although they could not read the hieroglyphs, they memorized their appearance. [14]  They also made it out of the tomb and came to Atem's aid, while he was facing Zorc [8]  and engaged in  another battle .
