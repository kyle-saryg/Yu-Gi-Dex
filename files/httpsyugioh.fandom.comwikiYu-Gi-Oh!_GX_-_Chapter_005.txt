 Miss Duel Academy 
 
 "Terra Firma Gravity" , known as  "Earth Gravity"  in the Japanese version, is the fifth chapter of the  Yu-Gi-Oh! GX  manga . It was first printed in Japanese in the  V Jump  magazine and in English in the  Shonen Jump  magazine. Both of which were printed in  volume 1  of the  Yu-Gi-Oh! GX  graphic novels afterwards.
 As  Jaden  and  Bastion  settle their  Duel ,  Alexis  shows up looking for Jaden.
 
 Summary 
 The chapter opens with  Alexis Rhodes  searching for  Jaden Yuki  at the  Slifer Red  dorm. She had gone through the trouble of getting her  Battle City  DVD back from the person she had originally lent to, so that she could lend it to Jaden again. However, he's nowhere to be found, and his phone appears to be turned off as well. At the duel,  Bastion  comments to himself that he has enough "kindling" in his three " Fireball Tokens " and will set off a hellfire during his next turn.
 Jaden  Summons  " Elemental Hero Ocean " in  Attack Position , and Bastion speculates that he must have  drawn  " Polymerization ". Suddenly,  Syrus ' phone rings, and he finds it's Alexis. Jaden is about to declare an attack, and Bastion calls a "time out", shocked to find that even Syrus has Alexis' number. Syrus gives Alexis their current location. Bastion pulls himself together, and the duel continues, with Jaden attacking a "Fireball Token" with " Elemental Hero Poison Rose ". Bastion  activates  his  face-down  " Negate Attack ",  negating  the attack and ending Jaden's  Battle Phase . Bastion is not surprised that Jaden is getting better draws then he is, but declares that there's a card that can aid in making up for that. He activates " Reload ",  shuffling  his  hand  into his  Deck  and  drawing  a number of cards equal to the cards he shuffled.
 Bastion activates " Gathering of Malice ", which lets him fuse his three "Fireball Tokens" to  Fusion Summon  " Goka, the Pyre of Malice " in Attack Position. Syrus comments that as Bastion's jealously increases, so do the power of his monsters. Alexis is perplexed by this, and Syrus describes her as a "siren". Bastion declares that Jaden has "Polymerization" in his hand, and a support card for " Elemental Hero Terra Firma " Set on this field, so he activates " Card Destruction ", forcing both players to  discard  their hands and draw a number of cards equal to those discarded. Two of Bastion's discarded cards were monsters, so " Graveyard of Wandering Souls " activates, letting him Special Summon two "Fireball Tokens". Bastion activates "Goka's" effect, Tributing his three "Fireball Tokens", allowing him to increase "Goka's" attack or defense by 100 for each one Tributed. He chooses attack for all three, giving "Goka" 2500 attack points. Bastion attacks and destroys "Poison Rose" with "Goka", and believes that Jaden's Set card is no threat, as he can no longer Summon "Terra Firma" due to his lack of "Polymerization".
 Jaden draws, and switches "Ocean" to  Defense Position , while also Summoning " Elemental Hero Woodsman " in Defense Position. He Sets a card to end his turn. Bastion is proven correct, as he thought that Jaden's next draw would be "Woodsman". He then speculates that his face-down card must be " Alternate Fusion ", the Fusion Trap Card that he uses against  Mr. Ryuga . Bastion Summons " Rigrass Leever " and then activates " Nobleman of Extermination " on Jaden's Set card. He is again proven right, as "Alternate Fusion" is  removed from play . He attacks and destroys "Woodsman" and "Ocean" with "Goka" and "Leever", respectively, and ends his turn. Alexis and Syrus are impressed, but still believe that Jaden can turn the duel around as he always does, and all it will take is one good draw.
 Jaden Sets two cards, ending his turn. Jaden activates " Soul Fusion " as Bastion begins his turn, removing "Ocean" and "Woodsman" in his  Graveyard  from play and  paying  1000  Life Points  to Fusion Summon " Elemental Hero Terra Firma " in Attack Position. Bastion is shocked that Jaden had a second Trap Cad capable to fusing monsters, and Jaden activates his face-down " De-Fusion ", returning "Goka" to Bastion's Fusion Deck. Since its  Fusion Material Monsters  were tokens, they do not return to the field. Bastion switches "Leever" and "Fox Fire" to Defense Position. Jaden confirms that Bastion was correct - his last face-down is a support card for "Terra Firma". He activates it - " Terra Firma Gravity ", which forces all Level 4 and lower monsters on the opponent's side of the field to switch to Attack Position and attack "Terra Firma". This wins Jaden the duel.
 Bastion checks what he would have drawn next, and finds it was " Smashing Ground ", which he could have used to destroy "Terra Firma". Jaden tells him to fork over the DVDs, and Alexis reveals she brought the Battle City DVD over for Jaden, who reveals that Bastion has the Duelist Kingdom DVD as well. Alexis has not seen it, and is eager to. Jaden nonchalantly suggests that she and Bastion exchange numbers to keep in contact. Jaden still says he should get to borrow it first, but Bastion declares that it's "ladies first" and leaves with Alexis to get to the DVD.
