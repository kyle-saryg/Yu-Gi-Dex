 Summary 
 Seto Kaiba  and  Zigfried von Schroeder  continue their Duel. After Seto destroys one of Zigfried's Valkyries with his " XYZ-Dragon Cannon ", Zigfried manages to draw " Nibelung's Treasure " and equip Seto's Cannon with " Nibelung's Ring ", preventing it from attacking and also destroying Seto's Deck with each passing turn (due to the effect of " Nibelung's Ring "). Using Zigfried's " Fortune Chariot ", " Valkyrie Zweite " attacks Kaiba and whittles down his Life Points.
 Zigfried removes Kaiba's first "Blue-Eyes White Dragon" from play with his three Goddess cards and forces him to discard another with the effect of "Nibelung's Ring", but Kaiba makes a comeback when he summons the discarded "Blue-Eyes White Dragon" from the Graveyard (using " Monster Reborn ").
 However, Zigfried believes Kaiba's strategy is in vain, because then, he summons his " Valkyrie Brunhilde " and removes Seto's "Blue-Eyes White Dragon" from play with " Enchanted Sword Nothung ".  On his next turn, Kaiba manages to avoid the effect of " Nibelung's Ring " with " Graceful Charity ", allowing him to put his third "Blue-Eyes White Dragon" in the Graveyard so he can remove it (along with " Pitch-Dark Dragon ") from play to summon " Chaos Emperor Dragon ". Seto's new monster sends every card the players control on the field and in their hand to the Graveyard, inflicting 1500 damage to Zigfried. However, he regains them all when he uses his " Magical Alms " and " Final Light " cards.
 Seto makes another come-from-behind move when he draws himself a brand-new hand with " Card of Demise ".  In the end, his three "Blue-Eyes White Dragons", his " Luster Dragon #2 ", and "Chaos Emperor Dragon" are summoned back to the field through " Dimension Fusion ". Zigfried's "Valkyrie Brunhilde" destroys "Luster Dragon #2" and "Chaos Emperor Dragon", then avoids destruction from Kaiba's first "Blue-Eyes White Dragon". However, she is eventually destroyed by Kaiba's second "Blue-Eyes White Dragon", paving the way for his third "Blue-Eyes White Dragon" to attack directly. Kaiba is able to win, declaring to Zigfried that Zigfried, a mouse, could never beat Kaiba, calling himself the King of Beasts.
 
 Featured Duel: Seto Kaiba vs. Zigfried von Schroeder 
 Duel continues from previous episode. 
 Seto has 1100 Life Points remaining and controls " XYZ-Dragon Cannon " (2800/2600) in Attack Position.
 Zigfried has 2500 Life Points remaining and controls " Valkyrie Zweite " (1600/1600) and " Valkyrie Erste " (1600/1800) in Attack Position, " Fortune Chariot " (which is equipped to "Valkyrie Zwiete"), and " Nibelung's Ring " (which is equipped to "XYZ-Dragon Cannon")
 Turn 10: Kaiba  
Instead of conducting his normal draw,  Seto  is forced to  draw  two cards via the  effect  of " Nibelung's Ring " (" Monster Reborn " and " Attack Guidance Armor "). If one or both of those drawn cards is a  Monster Card , Seto must  discard  one of them, however neither drawn cards are monster cards. Seto then  Sets  a card.
 Turn 11: Zigfried 
 Zigfried  draws. Zigfried  activates  the second  effect  of "Fortune Chariot" to halve the  ATK  of the equipped "Valkyrie Zweite" ("Valkyrie Zweite": 1600 → 800/1600) and allow it to  attack   directly  this  turn . "Valkyrie Zweite" attacks directly, but Seto activates his face-down "Attack Guidance Armor" to redirect the attack to "Valkyrie Erste". In response, Zigfried activates his face-down " Wotan's Judgment " to switch the top card of his  Deck  with a  Magic Card  from his  hand  (" Nobleman of Crossout "), negate the attack, and end the  Battle Phase . [Notes 1] 
 Zigfried's hand is shown to contain "Gryphon's Feather Duster" and " Goddess Skuld's Oracle " at this point. Zigfried then activates " Goddess Urd's Verdict ", " Goddess Verdande's Guidance ", and "Goddess Skuld's Oracle". He activates the effect of "Goddess Skuld's Oracle". Now once a turn, Zigfried can use "Goddess Skuld's Oracle" to look at the top three cards of Seto's Deck and rearrange them to however he wishes. Also once a turn, Zigfried can use "Goddess Verdande's Guidance" to guess the card type of the top card of Kaiba's Deck. If he is correct, Kaiba must set the top card of his Deck face-down on his side of the field. In addition, Zigfried can use the effect of "Goddess Urd's Verdict" once a turn to select one of Kaiba's set cards and guess what that card is. If he is correct, then the set card will be removed from play. 
 Zigfried activates the effect of "Goddess Skuld's Oracle" to look at the top three cards of Seto's Deck (three " Blue-Eyes White Dragons "). Zigfried activates the effect of "Goddess Verdande's Guidance" and guesses that the top card of Seto's Deck is a Monster Card. He is correct, so Seto  Special Summons  "Blue-Eyes White Dragon" in  face-down   Defense Position . Zigfried then activates the effect of "Goddess Urd's Verdict" and declares that Seto's face-down monster is "Blue-Eyes White Dragon". He is correct, so "Blue-Eyes White Dragon" is removed from play. During the End Phase, the effect of "Fortune Chariot" expires ("Valkyrie Zweite": 800 → 1600/1600).
 Turn 12: Kaiba  
Due to the effect of "Nibelung's Ring", Seto draws two cards (two "Blue-Eyes White Dragons") instead of conducting a normal draw. He discards "Blue-Eyes White Dragon". Seto activates "Monster Reborn" to Special Summon the discarded "Blue-Eyes White Dragon" (3000/2500) from his  Graveyard  in  Attack Position . "Blue-Eyes White Dragon" attacks "Valkyrie Zweite", but Zigfried destroys "Fortune Chariot" via its own effect to prevent "Valkyrie Zweite" from being destroyed (Zigfried 2500 → 1100).
 Turn 13: Zigfried  
Zigfried draws. He then activates the effect of his "Goddess Skuld's Oracle" to look at the top three cards of Seto's Deck (" Shrink ", " Cave Dragon " and " Luster Dragon #2 ). Zigfried tells Seto to place "Luster Dragon #2" on top and he does so. Zigfried then activates the effect of "Goddess Verdande's Guidance" and guesses that Seto's top card is a Monster Card. He is correct, so Seto Special Summons "Luster Dragon #2" in face-down Defense Position. Zigfried then activates the effect of "Goddess Urd's Verdict" and declares that Seto's face-down monster is "Luster Dragon #2". He is correct, so "Luster Dragon #2" is removed from play. 
 Zigfried then activates " Gryphon's Feather Duster " to destroy all Spell and Trap Cards he controls and gain 500  Life Points  for each  Spell  and  Trap Card  destroyed this way. Three are destroyed (Zigfried 1100 → 2600). He then  Tributes  "Valkyrie Zweite" and "Valkyrie Erste" in order to  Tribute Summon  "Valkyrie Brunhilde" (1800/2000) in  Defense Position . Due to the effect of "Valkyrie Brunhilde", it gains 300 ATK for each Dragon-type monster and Warrior-type monster on the field. There is currently one ("Valkyrie Brunhilde": 1800 → 2100/2000).
 Turn 14: Kaiba  
Due to the effect of "Nibelung's Ring", Seto draws two cards ("Cave Dragon" and "Shrink") instead of conducting a normal draw. He discards "Cave Dragon". "Blue-Eyes White Dragon" attacks "Valkyrie Brunhilde", but Zigfried activates the second effect of "Valkyrie Brunhilde" to reduce its DEF by 1000 ("Valkyrie Brunhilde": 2100/2000 → 1000) in order to prevent it from being destroyed by battle. Seto Sets a card.
 Turn 15: Zigfried  
Zigfried draws. He then switches his "Valkyrie Brunhilde" to Attack Position. Zigfried then activates " Enchanted Sword Nothung ", equipping it to "Valkyrie Brunhilde" and increasing its ATK by 400 ("Valkyrie Brunhilde": 2100 → 2500/1000). The second effect of "Enchanted Sword Nothung" activates, destroying "Blue-Eyes White Dragon" and removing it from play ("Valkyrie Brunhilde": 2500 → 2200/1000). Now if Kaiba attacks "Valkyrie Brunhilde" with a Dragon-Type monster, "Enchanted Sword Nothung" will destroy that monster at the start of the Damage Step without applying Damage Calculation. 
 Zigfried then activates " Pegasus Wing " to halve the ATK of "Valkyrie Brunhilde" ("Valkyrie Brunhilde": 2200 → 1100/1000) and allow it to attack directly this turn. "Valkyrie Brunhilde" attacks directly, but Seto activates his face-down "Shrink" to halve the ATK of "Valkyrie Brunhilde" ("Valkyrie Brunhilde": 1100 → 550/1000). The direct attack continues (Seto 1100 → 550). On Zigfried's End Phase, the effect of "Pegasus Wing" and "Shrink" expire ("Valkyrie Brunhilde": 550 → 2200/1000).
 Turn 16: Kaiba  
Due to the effect of "Nibelung's Ring", Seto draws two cards (" Graceful Charity " and " Emergency Provisons ") instead of conducting a normal draw. Seto activates "Graceful Charity" to draw three cards and discard two cards ("Blue-Eyes White Dragon" and " Cloning "). He then removes from play "Blue-Eyes White Dragon" and " Pitch-Dark Dragon " from his Graveyard in order to Special Summon " Chaos Emperor Dragon " (3000/2500) from his hand in Attack Position. ("Valkyrie Brunhilde": 2200 → 2500/2000). 
 Seto Sets a card and activates "Emergency Provisions" to  send  the Set card to the Graveyard and gain 1000 Life Points (Seto 550 → 1550). He then activates the effect of "Chaos Emperor Dragon" to pay 1000 Life Points (Seto 1550 → 550), send all cards in both players' hands and on the field to the Graveyard, and inflict 300  damage  to Zigfried for each card sent. Five cards are sent to the Graveyard (Zigfried 2600 → 1100).
 Turn 17: Zigfried  
Zigfried draws " Pot of Greed " and subsequently activates it to draw two cards. He then activates " Magical Alms ", which increases Zigfried's Life Points by 1000 upon its activation (Zigfried 1100 → 2100). Now during each player's turn, the turn player must predict how many Spell Cards they will activate for the rest of that turn. Both players will then gain 500 Life Points for each Spell Card predicted. However, should the turn player activate less Spell Cards than they predicted, that player will take 1000 damage for every Spell Card predicted during their End Phase. Zigfried proceeds to use the effect of "Magical Alms" and predicts he will activate  one  more Spell Card this turn (Zigfried 2100 → 2600; Seto 550 → 1050). 
 Zigfried then activates " Final Light " to pay 1000 Life Points (Zigfried 2600 → 1600), Special Summon one  LIGHT  monster from his  Graveyard , and allow Seto to Special Summon one monster with 2000 or less ATK from his Graveyard. Zigfried Special Summons "Valkyrie Brunhilde" (1800/2000) in Attack Position while Seto Special Summons "Cave Dragon" (2000/100) in Attack Position ("Valkyrie Brunhilde": 1800 → 2100/2000). "Valkyrie Brunhilde" attacks and destroys "Cave Dragon" (Seto 1050 → 950) ("Valkyrie Brunhilde": 2100 → 1800/2000).
 Turn 18: Kaiba  
Seto draws " Card of Demise ". He then proceeds to use the effect of "Magical Alms" and predicts he will activate  four  Spell Cards this turn (Zigfried 1600 → 3600; Seto 950 → 2950). He then activates "Card of Demise" to draw until he has five cards in his hand (his hand is empty so he draws five cards). Five turns after the activation of "Card of Demise", Seto must discard his entire hand during his Standby Phase. Seto then activates " Soul Release " to remove from play his "Chaos Emperor Dragon" from his Graveyard. He then activates " Spell Reproduction " to discard two Magic Cards (" Absorb Spell  " and " Cost Down ") and add " Dimension Fusion " from his Graveyard to his hand. " De-Fusion " is shown to be the only other card remaining in Seto's hand at this point. 
 Seto then activates "Dimension Fusion" to pay 2000 Life Points (Seto 2950 → 950) and Special Summon three "Blue-Eyes White Dragons" (all three "Blue-Eyes": 3000/2500), his "Chaos Emperor Dragon" (3000/2500), and his "Luster Dragon #2" (2400/1400) from the  Removed from Play Zone  in  Attack Position  ("Valkyrie Brunhilde": 1800 → 3300/2000). 
 "Luster Dragon #2" attacks "Valkyrie Brunhilde". "Valkyrie Brunhilde" destroys "Luster Dragon #2" (Seto 950 → 50) ("Valkyrie Brunhilde": 3300 → 3000/2000). "Chaos Emperor Dragon" attacks "Valkyrie Brunhilde", but Zigfried reduces the DEF of "Valkyrie Brunhilde" by 1000 ("Valkyrie Brunhilde": 3000/2000 → 1000) to prevent it from being destroyed by battle, so only "Chaos Emperor Dragon" is destroyed ("Valkyrie Brunhilde": 3000 → 2700/1000). The first "Blue-Eyes White Dragon" attacks "Valkyrie Brunhilde", but Zigfried reduces the DEF of "Valkyrie Brunhilde" by 1000 ("Valkyrie Brunhilde": 2700/1000 → 0) to prevent it from being destroyed by battle (Zigfried 3600 → 3300). The second "Blue-Eyes White Dragon" attacks and destroys "Valkyrie Brunhilde" (Zigfried 3300 → 3000). The third "Blue-Eyes White Dragon" then attacks directly (Zigfried 3000 → 0).
 
 Quotes 
 " (Thinking)  What!? THREE Blue-Eyes White Dragons!?"   "I'm guessing from the expression on your face, that my destiny's looking pretty good."
 — Zigfried and Kaiba 
 
 Differences in adaptations 
 Cut from the dub is a shot of  Mokuba  cheering for his brother. 
 In the Japanese dub, after Zigfried saw Kaiba has three Blue-Eyes White Dragons at the top of his deck, he thought ahead of how he could win by using the effect of " Valkyrie Erste " to steal Blue-Eyes White Dragon's ATK and unequip Fortune Chariot from " Valkyrie Zweite " and equip it to Valkyrie Erste to win the duel. 
 Cut from the dub is a sequence of first a pan of the field, and then  Zigfried  telling  Kaiba  laughing about how long he has waited for this day. 
 Cut from the dub is a shot from the flashback where a young Zigfried in anger smashes a photo of Kaiba and himself from his desk to the floor. 
 Cut from the dub is a shot showing the insignia of Schroeder Corp in the same flashback. 
 In the Japanese dub, when Kaiba draws " Graceful Charity " and " Emergency Provisons ", he says he didn't draw a Monster Card. In the US version talks Zigfried instead, reminding Kaiba that he must send to the Graveyard any monster he draws. 
 After Kaiba plays "Graceful Charity", a shot of Yugi and Yami Yugi is shown, with Yami Yugi saying "What a strange twist, Joey is cheering for Kaiba!" in the dub. In the original, Yami Yugi says that Kaiba's comeback has begun. 
 In the dub when Zigfried told Kaiba he couldn't afford to pay 1,000 LP to activate Chaos Emperor Dragon - Envoy of the End's special ability, he made a wisecrack comeback saying there's nothing he can't afford before proceeding to announce he would set a card. In the original, Kaiba just continued to announce he would set a card in response to Zigfried's remark. 
 Cut form the dub is a shot of a pan of the duel field when Kaiba explains Zigfried that "Chaos Emperor Dragon"'s effect will deal him 300 points of damage for each card that was sent to the Graveyard, and Zigfried's LP gauge showing his LP dropping to 1,100. In the US dub, the Life Point gauge is shown later. 
 The woman on " Soul Release " is given a dress to wear in the dub. 
 " Spell Reproduction " has been redesigned in the dub, replacing the six-pointed star with the symbol of Spellbinding Circle. 
 Errors 
       The layout of " Blue-Eyes White Dragon " changes.     
 In the Japanese version, when Kaiba displays his 3 " Blue-Eyes White Dragons " they all use the newer  layout , but later when 1 of them is shown in his hand it uses the old layout. Also, when he summons all three using "Dimension Fusion" at the end, they are all displayed using the old layout again, even though "Chaos Emperor Dragon" and "Luster Dragon 2" are using the new layout. Furthermore  Zigfried  uses " Pot of Greed ", it also has the old layout. 
 In the Japanese version, Zigfried's  Life Points  go from 3300 to 3000 twice: once when "Blue-Eyes White Dragon" destroys the shield of " Valkyrie Brunhilde ", and again when the next Blue-Eyes destroys Brunnhilde. They should have gone from 3600 to 3300 the first time. 
 When Kaiba activated " Emergency Provisions " he was shown with two other cards in his hand when he shouldn't have any other cards in his hand. 
 When Kaiba activates " Dimension Fusion ", he was shown having no cards in his hand when he should have had one.

 Notes 
 
 ↑   The Japanese lore of " Wotan's Judgment " says that the Deck must be shuffled after the cards are switched. Zigfried is not shown shuffling his Deck after he switches the cards, as he immediately activates his "Goddess"  Spell Cards  afterwards. The shuffling occurs offscreen at some point, since Zigfried never draws " Nobleman of Crossout " again. This is verified after Zigfried  activates  the last card in his hand later in the Duel, " Pegasus Wing ". 
 
 ↑  2.0   2.1   2.2   This card was in Kaiba's  hand . 
 
 ↑   This card was dropped by Zigfried after he lost. 
 
 ↑   This card was in Zigfried's  hand .
