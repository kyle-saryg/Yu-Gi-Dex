 Mechanics 
 The turn player can Special Summon a Maximum Monster from their hand, to the player's side on the field in Attack Position, composed of three pieces (left [L], central and right [R], in that order). Such a monster is treated to be in  Maximum Mode , and unlocks its effects and Maximum ATK.
 If the player already has monsters on the field, they can be freely removed to make way for the Maximum Summon. Despite having three monsters on the field, the player is treated to have only one monster, but the monsters' effects can be activated individually. If the player wishes to Normal Summon a monster, the Maximum Monster can be Normal Summoned to be treated as three separate monsters, but it then leaves the Maximum Mode, thus losing its effects.
