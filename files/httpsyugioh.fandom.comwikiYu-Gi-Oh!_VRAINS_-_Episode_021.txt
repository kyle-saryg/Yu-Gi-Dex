 " Story Time",  known as " Embers of a New Battle" ,   in the Japanese version, is the twenty-first episode of the  Yu-Gi-Oh! VRAINS  anime. It first aired in Japan on October 4, 2017. It became available with official subtitles via Crunchyroll on the same day. It aired on Teletoon on November 10, 2018 and on Pluto TV January 29, 2021. This episode is a clip show.
 Yusaku  and  Kolter  analyze  SOL Technologies ' data, and discover some new information about the incident ten years ago. Meanwhile, at Yusaku's house,  Ai  and  Roboppi  are secretly plotting something...
 
 Summary 
 Yusaku is at  Stardust Road  where Kolter's  Café Nom  is stationed. After Kolter gives Yusaku a slush drink, Yusaku questions how Kolter would expect to serve any customers at their current location. Kolter responds that he had already sold another hotdog while Yusaku was studying on his laptop. He hints that the person he sold to lives on the cliff overlooking the ocean. Yusaku then gets back to work, dismissing Kolter's worries as finding out about his past is more important than anything. 
 Kolter warns about their potential struggle against the  Knights of Hanoi ; he discloses that someone named  Dr. Kogami  was responsible for the  Lost Incident , according to SOL Technologies, but Kogami himself has not been seen since. Kolter wonders whether  Ai , who had absorbed the SOL data bank, can reveal any more leads. Ai is at Yusaku's home, having finished telling a story to  Roboppi , who replies that Playmaker is lucky to have him. Ai offers to tell another story.
 Ai first tells the story of  Ghost Gal  (whose name he pronounces wrong). He recalls that the winner of the duel wins Ai himself, which he claims is a result of his popularity. The  Ghost Gal vs. Playmaker duel  is then recalled, up to the point where Ghost Gal figures out Storm Access. At that point, Ai mentions to Roboppi that he play-acted in order to trick Ghost Gal, although the flashback appears to fabricate Playmaker's reaction to said play-acting. The  aftermath of said duel  is then recalled. Ai tells Roboppi that he gained the ability to hack into SOL Technologies and steal their data, to which Roboppi says stealing is wrong, so Ai corrects that he meant "take". 
 Playmaker's hack attempt  is then recalled, including  his duel against   Kitamura 's  Prototype Ai .  Blue Angel 's duel against the other Prototype Ai is also recalled. Prior to  Playmaker's duel against Akira Zaizen  being recalled, Ai claims that it was another fight over him, and he fake-cries over it. During said duel, Playmaker talked Ai down. Roboppi asks if Playmaker was jealous at the time. Roboppi also suggests downloading a "flamethrower app" but asks to hear the rest of the story first. This includes Blue Angel's intrusion during the duel, and  Akira's retelling of the Lost Incident , including how Playmaker saw it. The  data extraction that followed  after Playmaker's victory is also recalled, and Ai claims that even after absorbing the data, they still do not know everything. Ai also praises Roboppi's flattery.
 At the end of the day, Yusaku states that  Varis  may know something about the Lost Incident, claiming that he will not hide for long. Somewhere, Varis is staring at a blue dot as he makes his next move.
