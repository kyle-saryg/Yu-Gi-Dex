 In the non-canon duel  North American WCQ 2013 Special: Kaiba Vs Pegasus ,  Pegasus  summons this card on his first turn by using a pair of " Wind-Up Sharks " as  Xyz Material , after their  Levels  were modified. It  attacks   Kaiba 's " La Jinn the Mystical Genie of the Lamp ", but the attack is blocked by Kaiba's " Ancient Lamp ", causing "Adreus" to attack Pegasus' own " Wind-Up Magician " instead. Adreus then used its own effect to destroy "Ancient Lamp". The following turn, Adreus was destroyed by Kaiba's " Enemy Controller ".
