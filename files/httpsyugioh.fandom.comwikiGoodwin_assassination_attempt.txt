      Yusei  blocking  Greiger  from flying into  Goodwin .     
 The  Goodwin assassination attempt  was a failed plan of  Greiger 's aimed at killing  Rex Goodwin  in the  Yu-Gi-Oh! 5D's  anime.
 
 Events

       Goodwin catching the spike.     
 During the  Fortune Cup  after being defeated by  Yusei Fudo , the spike from Greiger's " Chariot Pile " card remained intact on his  Duel Runner ,  The Beast . Greiger showed the audience images of his village after the destruction. He then mounted his Duel Runner, drove it around the circuit and ramped in the direction of the tower Goodwin was inside. However Yusei had deduced his plan and rode around the circuit too and collided with Greiger mid-air, preventing him from crashing into the tower. During the collision, the "Chariot Pile" spike broke off The Beast and flew through the window of the tower. Using his mechanical hand, Goodwin caught the spike and stopped it spinning. The audience were unable to see Goodwin do this, but  Jack Atlas  who was in the same room first learned of Goodwin's mechanical arm then. [1]  Greiger was arrested after the assassination attempt. [2]
