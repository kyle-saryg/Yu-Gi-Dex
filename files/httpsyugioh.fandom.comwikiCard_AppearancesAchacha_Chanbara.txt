 Yu-Gi-Oh! ZEXAL 
 In  episode 53 ,  Yuma Tsukumo  uses this card during the  Duel Coaster   Battle Royal .  When " Heroic Champion - Excalibur " (whose ATK was 4000 via its own effect) attacks Quinton directly, Quinton activates " Neverending Nightmare " to negate the attack and inflict damage to Nistro equal to half the total ATK of "Heroic Champion - Excalibur". Yuma arrives and activates this card's effect to Special Summon it, nullify the damage Nistro would take and inflict 400 damage to Quinton. The outraged Quinton nearly tries to play a card out of anger for Yuma damaging his Life Points, but  Vetrix  tells him to leave Yuma be for now and Quinton reluctantly complies. 
 In  episode 90 , Yuma uses this card during his Duel against  Orbital 7 . When Yuma activates the effect of " Achacha Archer " to inflict 500 damage to Orbital 7, Yuma activates this card's effect to Special Summon it, nullify the damage Orbital 7 would take, and inflict 400 damage to Orbital 7. After Yuma Special Summons " Mimimic " via its own effect, Yuma overlays this card and "Achacha Archer" in order to  Xyz Summon  " Temtempo the Percussion Djinn ".
