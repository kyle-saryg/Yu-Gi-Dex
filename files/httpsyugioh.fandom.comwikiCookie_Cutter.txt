" Cookie Cutter " is a way of referring to a  Deck  that is created mostly from " Splashable " cards, with little or no general theme. Often, these Decks include powerful effects, monsters with high  ATK  and a few with high  DEF , but aren't specifically themed in any way. This term is usually used in a negative context, and as such these decks are believed to generally be used by players who only want a quick, effortless win, and believe they can achieve such a win by copying (like a cookie cutter which creates duplicates of a certain cookie shape) certain tournament-winning Decks. A similar term is  netdecking .
 
 Yu-Gi-Oh! GX  episodes  18  and  19  took a jab at this phenomenon with  Dimitri , a character who imitated the Decks of other Duelists to the point that he imitated the Duelists themselves as a result.
