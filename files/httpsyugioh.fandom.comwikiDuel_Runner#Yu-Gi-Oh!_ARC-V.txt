 Story 
 In  Yu-Gi-Oh! 5D's , Duel Runners were introduced by  KaibaCorp  as unique  Duel Disks  which are used for  Turbo Duels . They are equipped with a screen which shows Duel details such a the current  field  and  Life Points . It can approach speeds of up to 220 kilometers (136.62 miles) per hour during a Turbo Duel. In addition, other equipment like the helmet visor serves to display various information, such as the stats of a monster.
 In each Duel Runner, there are two specific cards integrated: the  Field Spell Cards  " Speed World " and " Speed World 2 ". If this card is activated then the Duel screen on the Runner will appear. Furthermore, all other information irrelevant to the Duel can be switched off. This card's activation automatically activates the Runner's Duel Disk.  Sector Security  is capable of forcibly activating the "Speed World" cards of other Duelists in order to force them into Turbo Duels. 
 Certain Duel Runners are known as "hybrid models". These Runners allow a Duel Disk to be attached to them, rather than have the Duel Disk connected directly to the interface. This allows a Duelist to use the same Duel Disk in both Ground and Turbo Duels.
 Season 2 introduces  Duel Boards , customized skateboards built to allow children to participate in Turbo Duels. 
 In  Yu-Gi-Oh! ARC-V , Duel Runners are reintroduced into the series with the introduction of  Yugo , a Synchro Duelist who resembles Yuya Sakaki. A new Field Spell Card, " Speed World Neo ", is also introduced but it does not possess any kind of unique effects such as  Speed Counters  and the exclusive use of  Speed Spell Cards . Turbo Duels are later combined with  Action Duels  via the Field Spell Card " Crossover Acceleration "; where  Action Cards  are placed at specific points on the track to be obtained.
 
 Examples 
 Anime 
 
 
 The  first Duel Runner  made by  Yusei Fudo . Jack Atlas stole it from him along with " Stardust Dragon " before leaving his friends. According to Jack Atlas, it has since been destroyed. In  Yu-Gi-Oh! 5D's World Championship 2009: Stardust Accelerator , this runner was not actually destroyed, but was actually being used to power an experiment in secret. The reason for this is unknown seeing as it was only seen in flashbacks.
 
 
 
 
 Yusei Fudo 's Duel Runner, known as  Yusei Go  is similar to the first one he made, but colored in red, which is known to be a rare color. It is a hybrid built mainly from refurbished scrap metal of older runners. It includes a Duel Disk in the design of a Battle City Duel Disk. The Disc along with most of the runner's parts, including the latest top of the line marketed KaibaCorp acceleration chip: the Skyline 30; were either scavenged or stolen from Sector Security. Has been modified by Yusei and Bruno with their new engine program in order to compete in the WRGP. Yusei believes this upgrade will also help him achieve  Accel Synchro . In  Yu-Gi-Oh! 3D Bonds Beyond Time ,  Jaden Yuki  asks Yusei about "Yusei Go" being the  Duel Disk  of the future.
 
 
 
 
 Jack Atlas ' Duel Runner, known as  Phoenix Whirlwind  in the dub, but known as  Wheel of Fortune  in the original. Jack's Duel Runner is a hybrid. In the dub, this is also Yusei's first Duel Runner. In a later episode it is mentioned that Jack's Duel Runner is the only one of its type in the world. It was later upgraded for WRGP.
 
 
 
 
 Sector Security Duel Runner  - Members of  Sector Security , including  Trudge , use this type of Duel Runner for Turbo Duels.

 Greiger 's Duel Runner - Called  The Beast  in the dub. A large, skull-adorned Duel Runner in the style of a dragster.

 Crow Hogan 's Duel Runner, known as  Blackbird  can change into a flight mode, by folding out a set of wings. This is also a hybrid model. It is revealed that this Duel Runner originally belonged to  Robert Pearson , who gave it to Crow before he died. Unknown to Crow up until  episode 95 , The Blackbird had a compartment in the back close to the engine which contained the  Black-Winged Dragon  card which was also used by Robert Pearson before he died. This card was unlocked from the compartment via a password that the  Crimson Dragon  unlocked during his duel with  Bolton . It was upgraded into the Volcanic for the WRGP.

 Rex Goodwin 's  Duel Runner  - Goodwin used this to fly off the  Daedalus Bridge . This Duel Runner came to symbolize freedom. This is the inspiration for the flight mode on the Blackbird.
 
 
 
 
 Kalin Kessler 's Duel Runner - Kalin uses this Duel Runner in Shadow Turbo Duels. It appears to have been created with such duels in mind, as it is able to take far more punishment than the typical Duel Runner. It is the Duel Runner equivalent to a Dark Signer's Duel Disk, with the dragon wing at the back and the teeth in the front. In  Yu-Gi-Oh! 5D's World Championship 2010: Reverse of Arcadia  it is called  Giganto L .
