 Summary 
 Yusei  rides through a desert area on the  Yusei Go  (Yusei's thoughts are added to this scene in the dub). He stops, and looks down a cliff. He sees two men chasing what appear to be three escaped inmates. One of the  inmates  throws a pendant up to the cliff, which lands near Yusei. The two men activate a tazer function in the prisoners' collars via their  Duel Disks  (in the dub, the electrocution happens off-screen, but is still implied by the reactions of the prisoners). The prisoners collapse, and Yusei asks the two men what they're doing. They respond that they're simply taking the man back to the mine. Saying that Yusei looks like a  Duelist , they tell him that  Crash Town  would welcome him and that he could get much work. The men depart with the now-unconscious prisoners. Yusei picks up the man's pendent and thinks that he didn't come here for work - he came here to get back his friend (in the dub, he thinks that he'd better head to town).
 As he rides towards Crash Town, Yusei remembers the letter he received from a resident of the town named  Barbara . She told him she had heard of Yusei's friendship with "him" and that she wants Yusei take "him" away from this town, as he'll surely die here (in the dub "die" is replaced with "meet his doom"). As he dismounts the Yusei Go, three men dressed in the same outfits as the ones earlier approach him, challenging him to a  Duel . Yusei responds that he only Duels Duelists (in the dub, he tells them he doesn't Duel amateurs). The men surround him, and one tells him that insults like that will only "get him to Hell quicker" (in the dub, the man states that this town belongs to them and that no one talks to them that way). Yusei is ready to accept their challenge, but is stopped by the arrival of Barbara, who reminds the thugs that Dueling before sundown is a violation of Crash Town's rules. She introduces herself to Yusei, telling him that it was she that wrote him the letter.
 Later, Barbara and Yusei talk on the cliff overlooking Crash Town. She tells Yusei that the time that the town's true troubles comes is at sunset, which is soon. Two  groups  of  Duel Runner  gangs enter the town from opposite directions. Barbara tells Yusei that the group with the red scarves are the Malcolm Group, led by  Malcolm , while the other group is the Ramon Group (Radley Bunch in the dub), led by  Radley . Yusei asks what's going to happen, and Barbara tells him to just watch and see. Malcolm calls for the "sensei" of his group - a large man with a circular  criminal mark  (in the dub, he is given the name " the Giant "). He asks who he'll be teaching a lesson too. Radley tells him that everyone talks big before a Duel starts, not knowing that those words will be their last (in the dub, he insults the Giant's intelligence). Radley calls for his group's "sensei", and  Kalin Kessler  emerges from the distance, playing a harmonica. Barbara tells Yusei that the town's Duel time is at sunset, and that by the time the sun finishes setting, one of the two Duelists will vanish. Barbara again tells Yusei to watch, as residents of the surrounding buildings pour out to watch the Duel as well.
 Two men dressed as undertakers emerge, riding a horse-drawn carriage.  A small boy  emerges from he crowd to watch, who seems to admire Kalin. Both Kalin and the Giant reach for the Duel Disks, which resemble Colt revolvers, as the crowd yells "Duel!" ("Draw!" in the dub). Kalin activates his first, and per Crash Town rules, takes the first turn. Kalin  Normal Summons  " Infernity Mirage " in  Attack Position  and  Sets  a card. Yusei says that Kalin seems different - the drive to Duel does not seem to be there. Barbara replies that Kalin came to this town as a man looking for a place to die (in the dub, Barbara states he came to this town to punish himself for something he  did in the past ). Barbara points to the mountain and explains that in it is a mineral called  dyne , which is used in the construction of Duel Runners. People rushed to the town to make money from mining the dyne. Malcolm and Radley were charge of the mining operation, and eventually started to using Duels to gather more miners. If one wins Duels here, they stand to make much money, but losers are sent to the mountain. Many great Duelists were tempted by the riches and ended up in the mines after losing. The Giant begins his turn, Normal Summoning " Illegal Keeper " in Attack Position. He knows his  hand  contains " Card Destruction ". If he plays it, the  effect  of "Illegal Keeper" will  return  the cards that Kalin  draws  to the  Deck  and inflict 1000 damage, as they were drawn outside the  Draw Phase . He activates it, but Kalin activates his  face-down  " Full Salvo ",  sending  his hand to the  Graveyard  and inflicting 200 damage to the Giant for each card sent, lowering the Giant to 3200  Life Points . In this way, "Card Destruction" has no effect on Kalin, as he has no hand to discard.
 Yusei knows that Kalin's ultimate strength is when he has no hand. Kalin activates the effect of "Infernity Mirage",  Tributing  it to  Special Summon  two " Infernity "  monsters  from his  Graveyard . He Special Summons " Infernity Archfiend " and " Infernity Destroyer ", both in Attack Position. Knowing he cannot destroy either monster this  turn , the Giant ends his turn. Kalin draws and activates " Infernity Burst ", inflicting 800 damage for each "Infernity" monster he  controls . The Giant is reduced to 1600. "Infernity Destroyer" attacks and destroys "Illegal Keeper", and the former's card effect activates, inflicting 1600 damage to Giant as Kalin has no hand. This wins Kalin the Duel. As the Giant's Life Points fall to zero, the undertakers approach in their carriage and lasso Kalin's fleeing opponent. They stuff him in a casket in the back of the wagon and take him to the mountains. Radley's group cheers as Barbara tells Yusei that the Giant will be a slave in the mines from now on. Yusei realizes that the three prisoners he saw earlier were running from the mines. Barbara states that Kalin is trying to kill himself using this town (in the dub, Yusei asks why Kalin doesn't just lose on purpose, and Barbara tells him she has no answer for that). Radley states that this is Kalin's fiftieth win in a row, and Malcolm tells them that they'll both be going to the mountains next time.
 Both groups leave, and Yusei attempts to get Kalin to talk with him, but the latter ignores him and rides off. Later that night, Malcolm is enraged and drunk in the courtyard of his villa (the bottles of alcohol are removed from the dub, as is a scene where he knocks out a henchman with a bottle). He muses that if  Lawton  was still here, Kalin would be nothing and be defeated "with one attack". Yusei enters the courtyard, wearing a poncho and states he's looking for work. The three thugs that confronted him in town earlier approach him. Malcolm agrees to hire him if he proves himself by defeating the three. The three thugs draw their cards. Yusei does as well, revealing he has a revolver-Duel Disk like the rest. Yusei says he'll go first (in the dub, he says "Get Your Game On!,  Jaden 's dub catchphrase), Normal Summoning " Changer Synchron " in  Defense Position  and Setting a card. The first thug Normal Summons " Fuse Ray Blaster " in Attack Position and ends his turn, stating he can't attack since it is a  Battle Royal . The second thug Normal Summons a "Fuse Ray Blaster" of his own, which triggers the effect of the first, inflicting 800 damage to Yusei. The third thug Normal Summons another "Fuse Ray Blaster", reducing Yusei to 1600 Life Points via the effects of the first two. The thugs state that there are "more than enough bullets" remaining, as it's shown each of their hands contains two more "Fuse Ray Blasters" (in the dub, they tell Yusei to give up).
 Yusei is nonplussed, brushing himself off and drawing. Yusei recalls Barbara explaining the plan to him - he'll get hired by Malcolm and then defeat Kalin the next night. Before they take him to the mountain, they'll take him back. Yusei sends the " Quillbolt Hedgehog " in his hand to the Graveyard to Special Summon " Quickdraw Synchron " from his hand. As he controls a  Tuner monster , he Special Summons "Quillbolt Hedgehog" from his Graveyard. Yusei tunes the  Level  2 "Quillbolt Hedgehog" with the Level 5 "Quickdraw Synchron" to  Synchro Summon  the Level 7 " Nitro Warrior " in Attack Position by treating "Quickdraw Synchron" as " Nitro Synchron " via its own effect. Yusei Normal Summons the Level 3 " Gauntlet Warrior " and then tunes it with the Level 1 "Changer Synchron" to Synchro Summon the Level 4 " Armory Arm " (in the dub, a scene is added where a narrator incorrectly explains the effect of "Armory Arm", stating that it can be  equipped  to a  Synchro Monster , when it can really be equipped to any monster). Since "Changer Synchron" was sent to the Graveyard, its effect activates, switching the third thug's "Fuse Ray Blaster" to Defense Position. Yusei activates the effect of "Armory Arm", equipping it to "Nitro Warrior" to increase its  ATK  by 1000. Yusei then equips "Nitro Warrior" with " Junk Barrage ". As a  Spell Card  was activated this turn, the ATK of "Nitro Warrior" rises by another 1000 via its own effect, to 3800.
 "Nitro Warrior" attacks and destroys the second thug's "Fuse Ray Blaster", defeating him, while the effect of "Nitro Warrior" switches the third thug's "Fuse Ray Blaster" to Attack Position. "Nitro Warrior" attacks and destroys it as well, defeating him. Yusei explains that that the effect of "Nitro Warrior" lets him switch a Defense Position monster to Attack Position and attack it if it destroys a monster  by battle . Then, the effect of "Armory Arm" inflicts damage equal to the destroyed monster's ATK. Then, the effect of "Junk Barrage" activates, inflicting damage equal to half the destroyed monster's ATK. Yusei activates his face-down " Synchro Overlimit ", allowing a Synchro Monster that destroyed a monster by battle this turn to attack again. "Nitro Warrior" attacks and destroys the first thug's "Fuse Ray Blaster", defeating him. Thus, Yusei has preformed three  OTKs . Yusei spins his Duel Disk on his finger and puts it back into the holster. Malcolm asks if he can hire Yusei to defeat Kalin, with Yusei telling him that the cost will be high (in the dub, he says he was hoping Malcolm would ask him).
 
 Featured Duels 
 Kalin Kessler vs. the Giant 
 Turn 1: Kalin 
 Kalin  draws. He then  Normal Summons  " Infernity Mirage " ( 1/0/0) in  Attack Position  and  Sets  a card.
 Turn 2: The Giant 
 The Giant  draws " Illegal Keeper " and subsequently Normal Summons it ( 3/1300/1300) in Attack Position. The Giant's hand contains a Trap Card, an unknown Spell Card, two Effect Monsters, and " Card Destruction ". He then  activates  "Card Destruction" to force both players to  discard  their  hands  and  draw  cards equal to the number of cards they discarded (The Giant intends to have Kalin discard his hand and draw four new cards. This will activate the effect of "Illegal Keeper", which will return Kalin's drawn cards to his Deck and inflict 1000 damage to Kalin). Kalin activates his face-down " Full Salvo " to  send  his hand to the Graveyard and inflict 200  damage  to the Giant for each card sent (the Giant 4000 → 3200). The effect of "Card Destruction"  resolves  and only the Giant is affected. As Kalin has no cards in his hand, he activates the effect of "Infernity Mirage" to Tribute itself and  Special Summon  " Infernity Archfiend " ( 4/1800/1200) and " Infernity Destroyer " ( 6/2300/1000) in Attack Position.
 Turn 3: Kalin 
Kalin draws " Infernity Burst " and subsequently activates it to inflict 800 damage to the Giant for each "Infernity" monster he  controls . (the Giant 3200 → 1600). "Infernity Destroyer" attacks and destroys "Illegal Keeper" (the Giant 1600 → 600). Since "Infernity Destroyer" destroyed a monster by battle and sent it to the Graveyard while Kalin had no cards in his hand, its effect activates, inflicting 1600 damage to the Giant (the Giant 600 → 0).
 
 Yusei Fudo vs. Malcolm Crew Thugs 
 Turn 1: Yusei 
 Yusei  draws " Changer Synchron " and subsequently Normal Summons it ( 1/0/0) in  Defense Position . He then  Sets  a card.
 Turn 2: Thug 1 
Thug 1 draws " Fuse Ray Blaster " and subsequently Normal Summons it ( 4/1600/800) in Attack Position.
 Turn 3: Thug 2 
Thug 2 draws "Fuse Ray Blaster" and subsequently Normal Summons it ( 4/1600/800) in Attack Position. The  effect  of Thug 1's "Fuse Ray Blaster"  activates , inflicting 800  damage  to Yusei as another "Fuse Ray Blaster" was Summoned while it was in Attack Position (Yusei 4000 → 3200).
 Turn 4: Thug 3 
Thug 3 draws "Fuse Ray Blaster" and subsequently Normal Summons it ( 4/1600/800) in Attack Position. The  effect  of Thug 1 and Thug 2's "Fuse Ray Blasters" activate (Yusei 3200 → 1600). All three Thugs are revealed to have two "Fuse Ray Blasters" in each of their hands and they intend to summon another "Fuse Ray Blaster" in order to inflict at least 1600 damage to Yusei.
 Turn 5: Yusei 
Yusei draws. He then  sends  " Quillbolt Hedgehog " from his  hand  to the  Graveyard  in order to  Special Summon  " Quickdraw Synchron " ( 5/700/1400) in Attack Position. He then activates the effect of "Quillbolt Hedgehog" in order to revive itself ( 2/800/800) in Attack Position. Yusei then tunes "Quillbolt Hedgehog" with "Quickdraw Synchron" in order to  Synchro Summon  " Nitro Warrior " ( 7/2800/1800) in Attack Position. Since "Quillbolt Hedgehog" has been removed from the field, it is removed from play as per its last effect. 
 Yusei then Normal Summons " Gauntlet Warrior " ( 3/400/1600) in Attack Position. He then tunes "Gauntlet Warrior" with "Changer Synchron" in order to Synchro Summon " Armory Arm " ( 4/1800/1200) in Attack Position. Since "Changer Synchron" was sent to the Graveyard for a Synchro Summon, its effect activates, allowing Yusei to switch Thug 3's "Fuse Ray Blaster" to  Defense Position . 
 Yusei then activates the effect of "Armory Arm",  equipping  it to "Nitro Warrior" and increasing its  ATK  by 1000 ("Nitro Warrior": 2800 → 3800/1800). Yusei then activates " Junk Barrage ", equipping it to "Nitro Warrior". Now when "Nitro Warrior" attacks and destroys a monster by battle and sends it to the Graveyard, the owner of the destroyed monster will take damage equal to half the destroyed monster's ATK. 
 "Nitro Warrior" attacks Thug 2's "Fuse Ray Blaster". The first effect of "Nitro Warrior" activates, increasing its ATK by 1000 ("Nitro Warrior": 3800 → 4800/1800). "Nitro Warrior" destroys Thug 2's "Fuse Ray Blaster" (Thug 2 4000 → 800). The final effect of "Armory Arm" activates, inflicting damage to Thug 2 equal to his destroyed monster's ATK (Thug 2 800 → 0). The effect of "Junk Barrage" then activates (Thug 2 takes no more damage at this point as his Life Points have already hit 0). At the end of the Damage Step, the first effect of "Nitro Warrior" expires ("Nitro Warrior": 4800 → 3800/1800). 
 Yusei then activates the second effect of "Nitro Warrior" to switch Thug 3's "Fuse Ray Blaster" to Attack Position and attack it with "Nitro Warrior". "Nitro Warrior" attacks and destroys Thug 3's "Fuse Ray Blaster" (Thug 3 4000 → 1800). The effect of "Armory Arm" activates (Thug 3 1800 → 200). The effect of "Junk Barrage" then activates (Thug 3 200 → 0). 
 Yusei then activates his face-down " Synchro Overlimit " to allow "Nitro Warrior" to attack again as it destroyed a monster by battle. "Nitro Warrior" attacks and destroys Thug 1's "Fuse Ray Blaster" (Thug 1 4000 → 1800). The effect of "Armory Arm" then activates (Thug 1 1800 → 200). The effect of "Junk Barrage" then activates (Thug 1 200 → 0).
 
 Mistakes

 The dub uses the Japanese artwork for " Full Salvo " as opposed to the  edited version . 
 In the dub, " Quillbolt Hedgehog " was shown as a  LIGHT   monster . 
 In the dub, " Blackwing Armed Wing " was seen with its Japanese artwork during the card explanation given for " Armory Arm ". 
 In the dub, when Yusei summons " Quickdraw Synchron ", he calls it "Quickdraw". 
 Changes on the Japanese DVDs 
 Throughout the episode, some shots of Crash Town are redone as well as some background shots, one shot of the gun Duel Disks and the shot of the gun Duel Disks panning up to Yusei is reversed.
