 History 
 Anime 
       Orbital 7  finds that the  Emperor's Key  is connected to " Numbers ".     
 Orbital 7 found out that  Yuma Tsukumo 's  Emperor's Key  is related to the "Number" cards here, thus visited the  Heartland Middleschool  under Kite's orders to retrieve it, otherwise he would be turned to scrap.
 
       Kite using  Baria Crystal .     
 After Kite defeated  Reginald Kastle  above the school, he flew away with the claimed key and began to study it here. He used Orbital 7's  Baria Crystal  energy in order to force the key to produce a portal which he could enter. He then entered to Duel  Astral  and claim the "Numbers" which he holds.
 In order to get Astral back, Yuma and his friends ask  Mr. Kay  to send one of his famous  Crashbug Viruses  throughout the city in order to locate the key. When one of the virus particles reports the location, Yuma and co run to it. When they get there, the defenses of the facility are too strong but thanks to Mr. Kay's virus, the doors open.
 Seeing that there are intruders, Orbital 7 sent out his brothers,  Orbital 5  and  Orbital 6  to dispose of Yuma and his friends. But they managed to distract the machines so that Yuma can find Astral. 
 When Yuma manages to get to the control room, he is faced with more of the buildings complex defences to which when he presses the buttons on, an image of Kite and  Hart  appears, shocking Yuma. When Orbital 7 sees that Yuma is outside the control room, he tries to attack him but fails as his drills get stuck in the wall. Yuma then runs into the control room and enters the portal that Kite and Orbital 7 created.
 
         The laboratory beginning to explode.     
 The building later exploded, which Yuma's friends think killed him as they didn't see him exit, but he managed to escape it by hiding in the Emperor's Key until the flames had died down. During the opening ceremonies of the  World Duel Carnival ,  Mr. Heartland  questioned Kite on the mysterious explosion which occurred here which Kite replies that there was a malfunction with some of the machinery (in the dub, Kite lied to Mr Heartland that he didn't know anything about the incident). Later in  Yu-Gi-Oh! ZEXAL II , this laboratory was rebuilt at Heartland Tower as a place for Kite and Orbital 7 to research about the Barians.
