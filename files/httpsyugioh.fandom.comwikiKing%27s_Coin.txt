      A King's Coin.     
 A  King's Coin , known as a  Conqueror's Coin  (覇者のコイン  Hasha no Koin ) in the Japanese version, is a coin in the  Yu-Gi-Oh! ZEXAL  anime used by  Kazuma Tsukumo  to mark his presence at each set of ruins he had explored, totaling twenty-three ruins. [1] 
 While on his journey to locate the  Mythyrian "Numbers" ,  Yuma Tsukumo  found a King's Coin at  every ruin  he had visited. [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] 
 According to  Kite Tenjo , the coins were made with  Astralite . He believes that Kazuma Tsukumo left these seven coins in the ruins so that Yuma could travel to the  Astral World  if there was ever a need for that. [8]
