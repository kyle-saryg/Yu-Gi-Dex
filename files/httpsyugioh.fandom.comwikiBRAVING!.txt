 Lyrics (TV Size) 
 Japanese Romaji English 
 
 近 づいて 手 を 伸 ばした 
 明日 へと 続 く 光 
 足 元 に 広 がるこの 世 界 の 夢 を 見 た 
 
 夢 と 希 望 は 何 処 にあるなんて 知 らないよ 
 走 り 回 って 探 しても 見 つからない 
 真 実 と 嘘 の 挟 間 に 落 ちているのかな 
 僕 らの 物 語 なら 始 まってもいない 
 
 明日 へ 続 く 崩 れ 落 ちそうな 道 も 
 強 気 になる 前 に 飛 び 出 していこう 
 
 近 づいて 遠 のいていく 
 真 実 を 掴 む 為 に 
 見 えない 未 来 から 希 望 を 探 し 出 す 
 誰 よりも 固 い 心 
 身 に 着 けて 駆 け 上 がるよ 
 弱 さと 戦 って 勝 ちあがる 強 さを 
 見 つける 為 に 
かけがえのない 仲 間 と 
 足 元 に 広 がるこの 世 界 の 明日 を 見 た
 
 
 
 Chikazuite te o nobashita 
ashita e to tsuzuku hikari 
ashimoto ni hirogaru kono sekai no yume o mita 
 
Yume to kibou wa doko ni aru nante shiranai yo 
Hashiri mawatte sagashitemo mitsukaranai 
shinjitsu to uso no hazama ni ochite iru no ka na 
bokura no monogatari nara hajimattemo inai 
 
Ashita e tsuzuku kuzureochi sou na michi mo 
yowaki naru mae ni tobidashite ikou 
 
Chikazuite too no ite iku 
shinjitsu o tsukamu tame ni 
mienai mirai kara kibou o sagashidasu 
dare yori mo katai kokoro

yowasa to tatakatte kachiagaru tsuyosa o 
Mitsukeru tame ni 
kakegae no nai nakama to 
 
Ashimoto ni hirogaru kono sekai no asu o mita
 
 
 
 Your approaching hand reached out towards tomorrow with a following light 
My pace quickened, and I saw this world's dream 
 
How can anyone say for sure where dreams and hopes can be found 
Running around in circles, searching for the undiscovered? 
How can the valley between lies and truth be crumbling away 
When our story hasn't even begun? 
 
The path that leads towards tomorrow is collapsing 
So let's take off before it becomes too unstable 
 
Take that approaching escape so that we can seize the truth 
We'll find the hope from that unseen future 
Our hearts are steadier than anyone's 
We fight with our weaknesses struggling through the fight and winning with our strengths 
 
I will find it with my irreplaceable comrades 
My pace quickened, and I saw this world's tomorrow

 何 度 も 失 って 何 度 も 取 り 戻 す  
 幼 さを 弱 さとして  逃 げていた 僕 自 身 を  
 貫 いた 言 葉 が 心 を 動 かした  
もう 逃 げないよ かけがえのない 仲 間 が  
 支 えてくれるから、この 世 界 を 生 きていく  
 
 信 じたいと 願 うだけ  
 明日 が 来 ればいいなと 思 うだけで  
 何 もしない 自 分 なんて  
もう 何 処 にもいない、 真 実 を 知 りたいから。  
 
 近 づいて 遠 のいていく　 真 実 を 掴 む 為 に 
 見 えない 未 来 から 希 望 を 探 し 出 す 
 
 誰 よりも 固 い 心 　 身 に 着 けて 駆 け 上 がるよ 
 弱 さと 戦 って 勝 ちあがる 強 さを 
 誰 よりも 強 い 想 い  誰 よりも 持 ち 続 ける  
 脆 さの 裏 にある 本 当 の 強 さを  
 見 つける 為 に 
かけがえのない 仲 間 と

 Trivia 
 According to  Satoshi Kuwabara , the scene where Shark walks in the rain symbolize his inner state. 
 The faces of  Trey  and  Quinton  are unrevealed, except for  Quattro  because of his early debut, is similar to the shadow silhouettes of " Meklord Emperors ", in  FREEDOM , as only the shadowy figure of " Meklord Emperor Wisel " is unveiled, and they're both the middle person of their groups. However, from  Episode 33  onwards, none of the  Vetrix Family  is unrevealed, due to the fact that they all appeared in episode 33. However, in  Take a Chance , their faces are revealed in the Season 2 dub.
