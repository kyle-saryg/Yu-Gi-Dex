 Details 
 When constructing a Deck,  Monster ,  Spell  and  Trap Cards  are placed in the Main Deck.  Fusion ,  Synchro ,  Xyz  and  Link Monsters  are placed in the  Extra Deck . If a player uses official  Monster Token  or  Counter  cards, these are to be stored in a separate location as well.
 When a  Duel  begins, the Main Deck is placed  face-down  in the  Deck Zone  of the  field . All cards in the Main Deck must remain  face-down  during the Duel, and neither player may view the contents of either player's Deck unless a  card effect  allows them to, after which the Deck must be  shuffled .
 Even if a card in the Deck is  face-up , it cannot be  looked  at by either player unless it is on top of the Deck, in which case it is  public knowledge .
