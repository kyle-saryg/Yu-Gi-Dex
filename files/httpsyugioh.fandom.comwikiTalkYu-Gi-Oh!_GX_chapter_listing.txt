 just question
 
 Where to get 
 I want to add to the chapter summaries, but I don't know where to see the chapters. Could someone enlighten me?
 Yeah, it is annoying trying to read the chapter summaries when there are none. I would make some myself, but I can't find the chapters online, and my library is too slow to get new volumes. Is there someplace I can get the new chapters?  Pacifista15  ( talk  •  contribs ) 03:15, February 18, 2011 (UTC)
 
 Tatsu no Kiba Productions have some scanlations, but they only have up to around chapter 38. You may find other chapters scanalated by other people, but they're few and far between. As far the official VIZ English version, I haven't seen it online, only in the actual volumes and  Shonen Jump .  Cheesedude  ( talk  •  contribs ) 04:32, February 18, 2011 (UTC) 
 Notice 
 I'm pretty sure chapters 38 and 39 have been released. -- Montechristo95  20:57, June 22, 2010 (UTC)
