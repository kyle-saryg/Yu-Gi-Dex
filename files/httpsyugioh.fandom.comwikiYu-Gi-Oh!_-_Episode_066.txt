 Major Events 
 Strings  (controlled by  Marik ) continues the Duel with " Slifer the Sky Dragon " on his side. 
 Featured Duel: Yami Yugi vs. Strings, Part 2 
 Duel continued from previous episode. 
 Yami Yugi  has 4000  Life Points  remaining and controls " Buster Blader " (2600/2300) in Attack Position.
 Strings  has 3000 Life Points remaining and controls " Revival Jam " (1500/500) in Defense Position and two " Slime Tokens " (500/500) in Attack Position and " Jam Breeding Machine ", " Jam Defender ", and " Nightmare's Steelcage ".
 Turn 10: Yami Yugi 
 Yami Yugi   draws . He passes his turn.
 Turn 11: Strings 
 Strings  draws. Strings then activates the effect of " Jam Breeding Machine " to  Special Summon  a third " Slime Token " (500/500) in  Attack Position . Strings then  Tributes  all three " Slime Tokens " to  Tribute Summon  " Slifer the Sky Dragon " (X000/X000) in  Attack Position . Since Strings summoned a monster(s) besides a Slime Token, "Jam Breeding Machine" is destroyed. Due to the effect of "Slifer", its ATK and DEF are equal to the number of cards in Strings'  hand  times 1000. There are currently two ("Slifer": X000 → 2000/X000 → 2000). 
 By anime mechanics, since "Slifer the Sky Dragon" is also treated as a  Dragon - Type   monster , " Buster Blader " gains 500  ATK  via his  effect  ("Buster Blader": 2600 → 3100/2300).  Strings  then  activates  " Pot of Greed " ("Slifer": 2000 → 1000/2000 → 1000) to  draw  two cards ("Slifer": 1000 → 3000/1000 → 3000). Strings' hand contains "Infinite Cards", "Card of Safe Return", and " Humanoid Slime ".
 Turn 12: Yami Yugi 
 Yami Yugi  draws " Lightforce Sword ". Yami Yugi's hand contains " Berfomet ", " Big Shield Gardna ", " Magical Hats ", " Dark Magician Girl ", " Spellbinding Circle ", "Lightforce Sword", and " Kuriboh ". 
 Yami Yugi then  Sets  two cards and  Normal Summons  "Kuriboh" (300/200) in  Defense Position . (Note: "Slifer's" effect should have activated here, destroying "Kuriboh" as it has less than 2000 DEF, but by anime mechanics its effect counts as a "special attack", causing "Nightmare's Steelcage" to prevent it). On Yami Yugi's End Phase, " Nightmare's Steelcage " is  destroyed  as it has been two turns since it was activated.
 Turn 13: Strings 
Strings draws ("Slifer": 3000 → 4000/3000 → 4000). "Slifer"  attacks  "Buster Blader", but  Yami Yugi   activates  his face-down "Lightforce Sword" to  remove from play  one card in  Strings '  hand  for three turns ("Slifer" 4000 → 3000/4000 → 3000). "Buster Blader" prepares to counterattack "Slifer", but by anime mechanics, Strings uses the effect of " Jam Defender " to redirect the 'attack' of "Buster Blader" to " Revival Jam ", destroying it and saving "Slifer". "Revival Jam" then revives itself (1500/500) in Defense Position through its own effect. 
 Strings   activates  " Card of Safe Return ", allowing him to  draw  three cards whenever a  monster  is  Special Summoned  from the  Graveyard . The effect of "Card of Safe Return" activates and Strings draws three cards ("Slifer": 2000 → 5000/2000 → 5000). By anime mechanics, "Slifer's" original  attack  continues,  destroying  "Buster Blader" ( Yami Yugi  4000 → 2100).
 Turn 14: Yami Yugi 
 Yami Yugi  draws "Magic Cylinder". He then  Tributes  "Kuriboh" in order to  Tribute Summon  " Dark Magician Girl " (2000/1700) in  Defense Position . The second mouth effect of "Slifer" then activates, which would reduce the DEF of "Dark Magician Girl" by 2000 and then destroy it as its DEF would drop to 0, but  Yami Yugi   activates  his face-down " Magical Hats " to hide his "Dark Magician Girl" in one of four hats and shuffle the hats. "Slifer's" 'special attack'  destroys  a "Hat", but it's empty.  Yami Yugi   Sets  two cards.
 Turn 15: Strings 
Strings draws ("Slifer": 5000 → 6000/5000 → 6000).  Strings  then  activates  " Infinite Cards " ("Slifer": 6000 → 5000/6000 → 5000) to remove the  hand size limit  and allow himself to hold as many cards in his  hand  as he wants. 
 "Slifer"  attacks  the "Hat" with "Dark Magician Girl" inside it, but  Yami Yugi  activates his face-down " Magic Cylinder " and his face-down " Spellbinding Circle " in response. The activated cards resolve in reverse order: By anime mechanics, "Spellbinding Circle" decreases the ATK of "Slifer" by 700 ("Slifer": 5000 → 4300/5000) after its attack has already been launched, while the anime effect of " Magic Cylinder " redirects the original attack of "Slifer" back to it, but Strings activates the effect of "Jam Defender" to change the attack target to "Revival Jam", destroying it instead. "Revival Jam" then revives itself (1500/500) in  Defense Position  via its own effect.  Strings  then  draws  three cards via the effect of "Card of Safe Return" ("Slifer": 4300 → 7300/5000 → 8000).
 Since  card effects  only affect an  Egyptian God Card  for one  turn , "Spellbinding Circle" is  destroyed  during the End Phase ("Slifer" : 7300 → 8000/8000).
 Turn 16: Yami Yugi 
 Yami Yugi   draws . He passes his turn.
 Turn 17: Strings 
Strings draws ("Slifer": 8000 → 9000/8000 → 9000). "Slifer"  attacks  and  destroys  "Dark Magician Girl".
 Duel concludes next episode. 
 
 Changes to the dub 
 A tiny bit at the beginning showing an elevated train passing over the waterway behind the Duel has been cut from the dub. 
 Yugi does not talk about the " Heart of the Cards " nor does Marik threaten to send Yugi to the Shadow Realm in the original. 
 A short sequence showing  Anzu ,  Honda , and  Grandpa , then  Jonouchi , and little Yugi, is cut from the US version. 
 The scene in which " Dark Magician Girl " is being destroyed by " Slifer the Sky Dragon " is made "shiny", colored and is obscured over to be less graphic in the dub. 
 When Marik announces "the time has come" to summon Slifer, thunder rumbles in rhythm with his words. 
 Errors 
       " Dark Magician " in  episode 65 .     
 In the previous episode, " Dark Magician " was seen in Yugi's  hand . However, it does not appear in his hand or is seen at all in this episode. 
 As "Slifer's" ATK increases to 5000, Strings is incorrectly shown to hold 6 cards in his hand. 
 For most of the Duel, "Slifer the Sky Dragon's" card is another card already in play. 
 In the Japanese version, when "Kuriboh" is Summoned, its card hologram has no  Level .
