       Heartland Tower     
 Heartland Tower  is a huge tower in  Heartland  in the  Yu-Gi-Oh! ZEXAL  series, which serves as the residence of  Dr. Faker  and his family. It features a giant heart on the top, which symbolizes  the city 's name.
 Below this tower there was a space rift created by  Hart Tenjo , which leads to the  Astral World . It was being used to throw all the trash collected by  Litterbots  into the Astral World. The top of the tower was also Hart Tenjo's bedroom decorated up with lots of colorful stars like a child's playroom with a view over the city, which was accessible by an elevator. [1] [2] 
 
       Heartland Tower destroyed.     
 The heart on top of the tower includes a system to defend against aerial attacks; concealed beneath the tiles of the heart are multiple laser cannons. [3] 
 
       Heartland Tower being rebuilt.     
 In the anime, after the finals of the  World Duel Carnival  ended, the  Sphere Field  destroyed the tower while integrating with the  Sphere Field Cannon  beneath it. [4]  However, it was later shown that the tower was being rebuilt. [5] 
 
         Kaito  detonates the Heartland Tower.     
 In the  manga , once  Kyoji Yagumo  declared the " Numbers  War",  Kaito  fled from the tower with  Haruto , blowing it up in the process. [6]
