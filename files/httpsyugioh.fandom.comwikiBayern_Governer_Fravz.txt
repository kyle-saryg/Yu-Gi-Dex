 Bayern Governer Fravz  is a character in the  Yu-Gi-Oh!  anime. [1] 
 His name appears on a list of politicians, but the name is blurred and made unreadable in the English version. [1] 
 
 Biography 
 At some point, Fravz was involved in some incident that Kaiba has knowledge of. (There is no mention of this in the English version.) He also sent a letter of recommendation for Zigfried Lloyd, a pseudonym used by  Zigfried von Schroeder , to enter a tournament. [1] 
 When  Seto Kaiba  ordered an investigation of Zigfried Lloyd, hoping to find a connection to the Schroeder family, he found no personal information, but did receive a list of politicians who sent recommendations for him to enter tournaments. None of them were able to comment to Kaiba's employees, but Kaiba asked them to tell Fravz that he still remembers "what happened" to get him to talk. (In the English version, Kaiba said to make him an offer he couldn't refuse.) [1] 
 
 Trivia 
 Bayern  is the German name for the region of Bavaria in Germany.
 In keeping with Zigfried's characterization, a former king of Bavaria was the patron and friend of the composer Richard Wagner; Ziegfried's deck is based on one of Wagner's most famous compositions: the Ring Cycle.
