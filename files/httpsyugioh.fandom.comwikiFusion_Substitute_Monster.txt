 Fusion Substitute Monster
 
 
 A  Fusion Substitute Monster  ( 融 合 素 材 代 用 モンスター  Yūgō Sozai Daiyō Monsutā ) is a monster with an effect that allows it to replace a single specifically named  Fusion Material  for the  Fusion Summon  of a  Fusion Monster  (with the exception of " Shaddoll Core ", which substitues for Attributes instead), as long as the other monster(s) used are the correct one(s).

 Official Wording 
 This card can be used as a substitute for any 1 Fusion Material whose name is specifically listed on the Fusion Monster Card, but the other Fusion Material(s) must be correct. 
 — The latest version of the wording used on Fusion Substitute Monsters in the  TCG . 
 
 Limitations 
 Fusion Substitute Monsters cannot be used for:
 
 Fusion Monsters that can only be  Special Summoned  from the  Extra Deck  by removing the Fusion Materials listed on it from your field ( Contact Fusion ), such as with the " Neos ", " Gladiator Beast ", and " A-to-Z " Fusion Monsters. 
 Fusion Monsters that have a  strict Fusion Summon   condition .
 Any monster in the  Hex-Sealed Fusion   series  can be used as Fusion Material for a Special Summon with its own  Ignition Effect , even for the Special Summon of a monster that specifies that " A Fusion Summon of this monster can only be done with the above Fusion Materials ", since this Special Summon is not a Fusion Summon. 
 Fusion Monsters that do not specifically name any of their Fusion Materials, such as " Ojama Knight " or " Evil HERO Dark Gaia ".
 If the Fusion Monster has both specifically named and unnamed Fusion Materials (like " Ultimate Ancient Gear Golem "), then a Fusion Substitute Monster can be used, but only for the specifically named Fusion Material. 
 A Fusion Summon which is already using another Fusion Substitute Monster. 
 A Fusion Summon with " Cyberdark Impact! ", because the monsters that must be used as Fusion Materials are specifically named on the card performing the Fusion Summon. 
 The effect that allows Fusion Substitute Monsters to replace a Fusion Material  has no classification . It applies on the  field  (even while  face-down ), in the  hand , and in the  Graveyard . It does not apply while in the  Main Deck  or while  banished , so this effect cannot be used for " Future Fusion " or " Parallel World Fusion ".

 Treated as alternate name 
 Some cards can replace Fusion Materials by  treating their name  as that of a Fusion Material.
 For example, " Elemental HERO Prisma " can send a Fusion Material listed on a Fusion Monster card from the Deck to the Graveyard to treat its name as that card's. Since it is being treated as that card's name and not replacing a Fusion Material, it is not a Fusion Substitute Monster and treated as being correct, so can be used for the Fusion Summon of monsters with  strict Fusion Materials , such as " Cyber End Dragon " and " Cyber Blader ". Also, for Fusion Summons in which Fusion Substitute Monsters are valid, it can be used in the same Fusion Summon as one.
