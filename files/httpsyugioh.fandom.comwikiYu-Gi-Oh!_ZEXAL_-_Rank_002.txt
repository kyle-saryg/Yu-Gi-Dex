 Astral!! 
 
 "A Mysterious Life-Form?!"  is the second chapter of the  Yu-Gi-Oh! ZEXAL  manga .
 This chapter was first printed in the 3/2011 issue of  V Jump , released on January 21, 2011. It was later reprinted in the  volume 1  of  Yu-Gi-Oh! ZEXAL .
 Yuma 's  Duel  with  Shark  begins with  Tetsuo 's and Yuma's  Decks  on the line. Shark overpowers Yuma during the Duel, but when Yuma decides to believe in himself, his broken  pendant  restores itself, and Yuma uses it to open  the door  of his dreams. When he does so, a dark card, called a " Number ", possesses Shark, making him even stronger. However, at the same time,  a mysterious entity  appears before Yuma, telling him to stand up and win.
 
 Summary 
 As  Yuma  arrives to the marked place,  Shark  congratulates him on not chickening out, but says that running away would at least have saved his  Deck . Yuma replies saying that he'd rather never more  Duel  than running away from a guy like Shark. Both then set their  Duel Gazers  and  D-Pads , beginning the Duel, as  Kotori  and  Tetsuo  watch.
 Yuma begins his  turn  saying that " he will jet ", and  Normal Summons  " Zubaba Knight " in  Attack Position . He says that as one can't  attack  on the first turn, he'd then end his turn.
 As Shark  draws , he wonders if that 1600  ATK  is Yuma's strongest card, and Summons " Big Jaws " in Attack Position. Yuma is surprised at Shark's monster being stronger than "Zubaba Knight", as Shark declares that thanks to that, the  monster  with lowest ATK would be  destroyed  - and that that was not all; the player would also receive the difference as  damage . He also says weak monsters like "Zubaba Knight" should be played in  Defense Mode , and that even if Yuma had played a better card, that wouldn't have helped him, as he  activates  " Aqua Jet ", increasing the ATK of "Big Jaws" even more, and attacking "Zubaba Knight". The latter is destroyed, as Yuma's  Life Points  go down to 2800. Shark  Sets  a card and ends his turn.
 
         " Big Jaws " powered up by " Aqua Jet ".     
 Yuma draws, as he complains that all he's done so far was losing 1200 Life Points. He then Summons " Gagaga Magician " in Attack Position. Shark says that summoning a 1500-ATK in Attack Position was a blunder, but Yuma says it was not, as he  equips  "Gagaga Magician" with " Wonder Wand ", boosting his ATK to 2000. Yuma declares that if his monster's ATK is low, he can still power it up with  Spells  too, as Shark says Yuma is not as dumb as he looks. Kotori celebrates Yuma's monster being stronger than Shark's, as Yuma attacks, with Shark saying that Yuma is still a terrible  Duelist  though, having disregarding his  face-down  card. Shark activates " Poseidon Wind ", forcing "Gagaga Magician" back, and at the same time inflicting 800 points of  damage  to Yuma's Life Points. Kotori is worried about Yuma having lost half of his Life Points in just 3 turns. Yuma stands up and notes that he has a  Trap Card  in his  hand  as well. He says that he is playing a Trap Card face-down to end his turn. Shark is surprised, and Tetsuo tells Yuma that one can play both Spells or Trap Cards face-down, so he shouldn't tell his opponent which one he's playing.
 
         Tetsuo  tells  Yuma  not to tell his opponent which card he's  Setting .     
 Shark says that Yuma's completely idiot, and asks if he really intends to be the Duel Champion, as he starts his turn. He says he's done playing around, and Summons " Skull Kraken " in Attack Position. Seeing its 600 ATK, Yuma deduces that means Shark doesn't have a monster stronger than "Gagaga Magician". However, Shark says he wouldn't bet on that, as he activates the  effect  of "Skull Kraken" to destroy "Wander Wand", resetting the ATK of "Gagaga Magician" to 1500.
 Yuma's shocked on Shark's using monster effects now, as he slowly loses hope, saying that it's no good, that he can't "jet" at all, as he tightly holds  his pendant . Shark asks Yuma if he's still wearing "that piece of junk", and says that that's why he can't win there - because he was clinging to that "trinket". He also claims that one his own, Yuma is powerless, and can't do a thing. Trembling, Yuma tells himself that no matter how much he messed up or how many people laughed, he managed to keep "jetting" because he believed in himself. At that moment, the pendant lights up, and the piece which was broken restores itself.
 
         Yuma opens  the door , releasing the " Numbers ".     
 He then finds himself in front of  the door  from his dreams, which calls him to open it, in order to gain a new strength, at the cost of losing what he holds most important. Yuma notes the lock in the gate, and after a brief hesitation, rushes towards it, saying that he wasn't done "jetting" yet, as he opens the lock with his pendant. As the chains of the door tear and it opens, a huge light appears, and numerous cards get out of the door.
 
         Shark  possessed by the "Number".     
 Yuma then finds himself back at the Duel, and wonders if it was a dream, when he notes Shark surrounded by a dark aura, claiming that he feels powerful. A voice then tells Shark to call it - to call the " Number ". Shark then screams and Overlays "Skull Kraken" and "Big Jaws", both  Level  3, calling up " Number 17: Leviathan Dragon " to the  field . Tetsuo is surprised that that's not the monster Shark used against him, as Shark, now totally possessed by the "Number", activates it's effect - he  detaches  one  Xyz Material  from "Number 17: Leviathan Dragon" - "Skull Kraken" - in order to power up its ATK by 500, to 2500.
 
         A mysterious entity  appears before Yuma.     
 He attacks and destroys "Gagaga Magician", reducing Yuma's Life Points to 1000, as Kotori yells his name. Laughing, Shark claims that the Duel is over, and that he would finish it with the next attack. As Yuma falls due to the attack of the "Number", he wonders if he's really not good enough for that, but at that time,  a mysterious entity  stands next to Yuma telling him to stand up and win.
