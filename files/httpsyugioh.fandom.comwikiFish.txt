 Fish  ( 魚   Sakana ) is a  Type  of Monster Card. Fish-Type monsters are used by  Reginald Kastle ,  Ren  and  Nanami Maguro .
 In the past it had very little support, but it received support in  Tactical Evolution ,  Phantom Darkness ,  The Duelist Genesis ,  Crimson Crisis , and  Generation Force . Fish monsters were released in every core set from  Generation Force  until  Duelist Alliance . Many Fish support monsters have effects that require the presence or Tribute of another Fish to activate, or focus on manipulating advantage through  banishing  (dubbed  Generation Fish ).
 The first consistent strategy of a Fish Deck used to be to summon " Superancient Deepsea King Coelacanth " and use its effect to summon a combination of " Fishborg Blaster "s and " Oyster Meister "s to  Synchro Summon  the cards required to perform an  OTK . However, following the September 2011 List, this combo is no longer playable due to "Blaster" being Banned. This strategy can be used with " Fishborg Launcher ", but Launcher has restrictions to what can be Synchro Summoned. A newer strategy is to use the Deepsea King's effect to summon Level 2, 3, and 4 Fish monsters so as to  overlay  them into  Xyz Monsters  that can prove to be quite difficult to summon on their own, such as " Number 96: Dark Mist " and " Number 10: Illumiknight ". The release of the " Shark " monsters and the Generation Fish provided an Xyz strategy for Fish monsters, largely focusing on Rank 3-5 monsters, while the " White " monsters finally provided Fish with their own  Synchro Monsters .
 Fish Decks met with a reasonable amount of success at YCS Charlotte, with three Fish Decks making the top 32.
 Prominent Fish-Type monsters include " Fortress Whale ", " Superancient Deepsea King Coelacanth ", " Earthbound Immortal Chacu Challhua ", " Fishborg Blaster ", " White Aura Whale ", and " Shark Fortress ". The first  Xyz Monster  revealed and that appeared in both the anime and manga, " Submersible Carrier Aero Shark ", is Fish-Type.

 Playing style 
 Fish rely heavily on using removal to allow them to perform their OTK without interruption, and therefore commonly run " Trap Stun ", " Heavy Storm ", and " Malevolent Catastrophe ". " Gold Sarcophagus " is also commonly used to search out these cards.
 Due to the degree of which Fish are reliant on "Superancient Deepsea King Coelacanth", they must run a tribute engine. The only truly effective one for Fish at the moment is the  Frog  engine, which has the added benefit of giving Fish access to additional draw power in the form of " Formula Synchron ". Running a tribute engine allows Fish to take advantage of popular tribute monsters, most notably " Caius the Shadow Monarch " and " Light and Darkness Dragon ".
