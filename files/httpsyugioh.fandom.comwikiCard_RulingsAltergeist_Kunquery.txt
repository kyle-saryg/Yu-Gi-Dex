 OCG Rulings 
 Even if your opponent attacks you directly, if you have an “Altergeist” card on your field, you can activate the effect of " Altergeist Kunquery " in your hand. 
 If the effect of " Vanity's Emptiness " is applying when the effect of " Altergeist Kunquery " resolves, " Altergeist Kunquery " cannot be Special Summoned and the attack is not negated. (" Altergeist Kunquery " itself remains in your hand.) 
 Cards whose effects are negated by " Altergeist Kunquery " remain negated as long as they continue to be targeted by its effect. Therefore, since the effect of " Sangan " activates when it is sent to the Graveyard, it will not be negated by the effect of " Altergeist Kunquery ".
