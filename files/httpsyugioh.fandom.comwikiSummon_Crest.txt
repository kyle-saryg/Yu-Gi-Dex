Summon Crests  allow you to Summon your monsters and/or items to the  Dungeon  in the game of  Dungeon Dice Monsters .
 The number written in each Summon Crest represents the  Level  of the Dice, which determines the difficulty of the Summon.
 During your turn, if you roll at least 2 Summon Crests of the same Level, you can choose 1 of the dice that resulted in a Summon Crest and  dimension  it. After that, you can Summon 1 of your monsters that has the same  Type  and  Level  as the dimensioned die.
 Summon crests are  not  stored in your   Crest Counter ; they must be used OR discarded on the same turn that they were rolled.
