Our protagonist,  Yusaku Fujiki , is a cool student with excellent observation abilities.

 Trivia 
 This marks the first time since  Yu-Gi-Oh! GX  that the new Summoning method is not introduced in the first episode. 
 This is the first time a new Type is introduced in the first episode. 
 Not counting the first episode of the  Toei anime  Yu-Gi-Oh!  where  Duel Monsters  wasn't shown in the premiere, this is the first episode of a  Yu-Gi-Oh!   anime  to neither feature a full Duel, nor a "part 1" continuation of a Duel for  the second episode . 
 In the dub, the voice Yusaku hears in his dream is different in the preview and its TV debut. This could be due to the  voice's identity  was not revealed in the original yet during the preview's theater release.
