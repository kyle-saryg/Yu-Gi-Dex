 The different types of crests; Summon, Movement, Magic, Attack, Defense, and Trap. Original illustration. Bunkoban illustration. 
 There are over 500 different dice. [1] 
 Each die contains a monster. Dice are color coded to indicate the monster's type.
 White are  Spellcasters . [1] 
 Blue are  Warriors . [1] 
 Yellow are  Undead . [1] 
 Green are  Beasts . [1] 
 Red are  Dragons . [1] 
 The exception are black dice, which contain special abilities. [1] 
 A black die with a red Summon Crest is called a rare black die. In addition to a monster, a rare black die contains a special square on the inside of one of its faces. [2] 
 Each die has a crest, on each face. The different types of crests are Summon, Movement, Magic, Attack, Defense and Trap. [3] 
 The number of Summon Crests on a die indicates the monster's Level.
 Level 1 monsters have four crests. [3] 
 Level 2 monsters have three crests. [3] 
 Level 3 monsters have two crests. [3] 
 Level 4 monsters have one crest. [3] 
 Some crests have a number inside them, indicating their amount. [3] 
 Monsters inside the dice have an  ATK  number,  DEF  number and some have special abilities. [4] 
 Setup 
 Two to four people can play. [4] 
 Each player has a dice pool of twelve dice. [1] 
 Each player is represented by a Dungeon Master, which has three Life Points. [1] 
 At the beginning of the game, each player has a dungeon consisting of four squares at opposite sides of the table. Their Dungeon Masters are placed in their dungeons. [1] 
 Each player starts with three randomly dispensed dice. [1] 
 It is randomly determined who goes first. [4] 
 Turns 
 At the beginning of their turn, the turn player is dispensed more dice until they have three. [3] 
 The turn player rolls their three dice. [1] 
 If two of the player's dice land on Summon Crests, they may place one of those which landed on a Summon Crest on the board in such a way that when it unfolds, it connects to their dungeon. The six sides of the dice are added to the player's dungeon and the monster inside is placed in their dungeon on one of the die's squares. [1] 
 When a rare black die is unfolded, its special square contains an item, which monsters can interact with. [5] 
 Non-Summon Crests rolled by the player are stored in their crest pool. [3] 
 Each Movement Crest can be used to move a monster one space. [5] 
 Attack Crests can be used to attack monsters in adjacent squares. [5] 
 Attack, Defense, Movement, Magic and Trap Crests can be used as costs to activate monsters effects. [4] 
 When a monster attacks another, the one with lower ATK is destroyed. [5] 
 Each time a Dungeon Master is attacked, it loses a Life Point. When the Dungeon Master loses all its Life Points, its controller loses. [3] 
 Story 
           
 In the manga and anime, Dungeon Dice Monsters is created by  Ryuji Otogi  ( Duke Devlin  in the English anime).
 In the manga, Otogi creates the game under pressure from his father, Mr. Crown. Mr. Crown lost to a  Shadow Game  against  Sugoroku Mutou  ( Solomon Muto  in the English anime). Mr. Crown wants Otogi to avenge the defeat and harm  Yugi Mutou , Sugoroku's grandson.
 In the anime, he idolizes  Maximillion Pegasus  ( Pegasus J. Crawford  in the Japanese versions) and strives to create a game just as great as Duel Monsters. He emails the specifications to Pegasus, who challenged him to a match of the game at  Duelist Kingdom . Using the  Millennium Eye  to read his mind and thus, easily master the game, Pegasus defeats the creator. However, he was impressed with the game and agreed to market it. This is shortly before  Yugi Muto  arrives at  Duelist Kingdom .
 Upon being defeated, Pegasus goes into hiding, and the contract to market Dungeon Dice Monsters is never signed. Thus, the game does very poorly, and the only shop selling it is the one the creator himself owns. The creator blames his failure on Yugi. In the English anime, he believes that he cheated to beat Pegasus, crushing his spirit. In the Japanese versions, Otogi also accuses Yugi of cheating to win, that causing Otogi to lose contact with Pegasus.
 In the anime, he provokes Yugi into challenging him to a match by dueling his friend  Katsuya Jonouchi  (Joey Wheeler in the English anime) and forcing him to wear a dog costume. In the manga, he has one of the store security slip DDM packs into Yugi's pockets. He is then promptly 'found out' as the guards pretend to think he was trying to steal them and taken to a room. Otogi reveals himself and challenges Yugi.
 Yugi does poorly early on, obviously having little clue on how to play the game. However, he makes a comeback and defeats Otogi, displaying enough understanding of the game to summon the  Dark Magician  even after Otogi had dismissed it as impossible for Yugi to carry out another summoning, allowing him to turn the tables and defeat his opponent. Otogi admits defeat. In the manga, his father's game shop burns down to the ground.
 
         " Blast Lizard "     
 In the anime, shortly after the match, he receives another email from  Industrial Illusions , telling him they will sign the contract to market Dungeon Dice Monsters worldwide. It is later mentioned that he travels briefly to the U.S. to market the product, but later returns to Japan.
