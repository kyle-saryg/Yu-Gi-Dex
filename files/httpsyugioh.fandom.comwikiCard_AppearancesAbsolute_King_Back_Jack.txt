In the  following chapter , when Rex's " Ascension Sky Dragon " attacks Jack's " Hot Red Dragon Archfiend ", Jack activates this card's effect, banishing itself from the Graveyard to allow Jack to draw a card; it is " Champion's Storm ", a Trap Card which he is allowed to activate at that time. 
 In the  second part  of the two-part special chapter, Jack uses this card during his rematch with  Yusei Fudo . He Normal Summons this card, then tunes it with "Hot Red Dragon Archfiend" to  Synchro Summon  " Hot Red Dragon Archfiend Abyss ".
