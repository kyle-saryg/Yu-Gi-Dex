 In  episode 165 ,  Duke Devlin  uses this card during his Tag Duel with  Rebecca Hawkins  against  Valon . After Rebecca uses " Rope of Life " to summon " Luster Dragon #2 " from the  Graveyard  with 800 more ATK, Duke activates this card to Tribute "Luster Dragon #2" and summon " Diamond Head Dragon " in its place. Due to this card's effect, "Diamond Head Dragon" can't attack this turn, so Rebecca sets " Mirror Force " and ends her turn.
