 Biography 
 Yu-Gi-Oh! ZEXAL 
       Tombo's first appearance.     
 Before the opening ceremony of the  World Duel Carnival , Tombo arrived in  Heartland City  via a bus. [1] 
 Tombo defeated  Duelists  via matches using the  Basket Rule , earning himself a number of  Heart Pieces . This attracted the attention of WDC employees  Dextra  and  Nistro , who were sent to investigate his Duels as they originally thought he had been inflicting bodily harm on his victims, but when Dextra tasted the "blood" of one of the victims, it turned out to be tomato juice. [2] 
 When  Yuma Tsukumo 's rice ball was stolen by a passing bird, Tombo offered him and  Tori Meadows  some vegetables, but in return he wanted Tori to join him in creating a theme-park modeled after tomatoes (known as  Tomatotopia ) become the image girl for the theme park. This angered Yuma, who challenged Tombo because of his dislike of tomatoes. In response, Tombo challenged Yuma with the Basket Rule. Yuma at first objected, but Dextra and Nistro appeared and gave their approval. At first, Yuma was unable to eat the vegetables during the Duel, making Tombo very angry. Eventually, Tombo Summoned his  ace monster , " Tomato King ". Finally, upon Tori's urging, Yuma was able to eat one of Tombo's tomatoes, and found that he actually liked it, making Tombo gratefully a lot happier. Yuma went on to win the Duel, and won a Heart Piece from Tombo. [2] 
 Tombo was later seen among the spectators watching the final match between Yuma and  Vetrix . [3] 
 
 Yu-Gi-Oh! ZEXAL II 
 In  Bronk's  imagination of  Yuma 's and  Rio's  wedding, Tombo was seen as one of their guests. [4]
