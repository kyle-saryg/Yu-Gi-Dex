 The UDE --> KDE switch happened in 2009. Should the part in the beginning of the article about OCG cards being manufactured by Konami be editted? Or are TCG cards not printed by Konami? Thx.  SuperChecker  14:12, January 23, 2010 (UTC)
 
 Realesed on United sates or not? 
 I am trying to figure out if " Determined Daredevil " has been release if not when it will be release in the United States.  —This unsigned comment was made by  76.168.167.97  ( talk  •  contribs ) 06:10, December 5, 2010 
 
 All you have to do is look at its article. There are no TCG sets listed there, so it hasn't been released in the TCG yet. Looking through the other Duel Disk promos, the last two from  DDY2  have been released in English, so it may only be a few months before they reach this card.  「 ダイノ ガイ 千？！ 」 ?  ·  Talk⇒Dinoguy1000  14:39, December 5, 2010 (UTC)
