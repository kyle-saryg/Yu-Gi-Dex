 Non-duelist 
 Martha  is able to reset a character's hearts so the  player  can re-view their storyline, or to change them into an alternate character (like Duel Academy Akiza), and also allow you to edit your Partner's Deck before you have earned the right to do it by paying 10,000 DP. 
 Blister  is able to give the player information on where main characters are for several days, as well as letting the player put a tracer on a minor duelist character, so he can find them in the city to partner up with them. 
 Rudolph Heitmann  is able to give the player alternate style cards. 
 Stephanie  gives the player a drink at " Cafe la Geen " that sometimes pleases his partner and increases his hearts. She blushes whenever the player visits while partnered with  Jack Atlas . 
 Zora  will randomly give you something she found, usually an item or 200 DP, sometimes telling them to use it to help  Yusei . 
 The  MC  is randomly hiding in one area on the map, and changes location constantly. If you manage to find him, he can give you a prize of rare cards, a lot of DP, gift items, or increase a partner's Heart meter. 
 Kurumizawa  works in the  shop . 
 The  Familiar of Red Nova  can trigger an event at night by the crater. By visiting him with your partner, you can join the "night tournament", which is divided into 4 challenges - all involving  Tag Duels . By clearing one of them, the next one is unlocked. Once all the challenges are completed, the player receives one copy of each  Egyptian God .

 Trivia 
 The  Ghosts  imitating Crow and Primo are both listed as Duelist No.33, despite  Roman  also having that number. Similarly, the Ghosts imitating Dean and Wade - Ghost.SA and Ghost.YA - are both listed as No.99 despite  Alice  also being listed there. 
 The opponents that cannot be dueled outside of story events - normal  Sherry LeBlanc , normal  Primo , Antinomy, Ghosts - cannot be partnered with or viewed in the database. 
 In the game, the " Meklord Emperor " monsters are available in single card form, as they were released in the  OCG  and  TCG . However, their parts and cores are still in the game as well, the same as  Tag Force 5  (which calls forth all 5 pieces of the first three  Meklord Emperor  monsters). 
 Kalin Kessler  is the only character in the game that has more than two alternate stories. 
 If the player waits on the title screen without pressing any buttons, a demo duel between two random  Signers , in which their  Marks of the Dragon  will be shown. 
 A digital version of the game launched on the PlayStation Store in Japan on June 26, 2013. It can be played on PSP and PS Vita. 
 This was the first  Tag Force  game to not see any international release. 
 Konami  discontinued  add-on support and ended the availability of the PlayStation Store version on March 31, 2017. 
 Bugs 
 When a card that allows you to reveal cards from your deck, such as " Pot of Duality " or " Morphtronic Celfon ", is activated, the effect is resolved but in screen is shown another card from your Deck. For example: Pot of Duality reveals 3 cards, but in screen always is shown "Mirror Force". 
 The summon animation for " T.G. Blade Blaster " will not register in your photo gallery, regardless of whether you have fulfilled the requirements to unlock them. 
 The effect of " T.G. Recipro Dragonfly " will not Special Summon the Synchro Monsters from the Graveyard, if you have Normal Summoned any monsters when you use its effect. Its effect also allows you to send non-Synchro " T.G. " monsters to your Graveyard. 
 When you Normal Summon " Chain Resonator " while you control a Synchro Monster it allows you to Special Summon another "resonator" tuner despite saying in its card description "If your opponent controls a Synchro Monster...". 
 The summon and attack animations for the " Meklord Emperor 's" will only work when you special summon them with their "Core" effect. The summon and attack animations do not work on their  OCG  versions. 
 Every now and then, Yusei's AI (while it controls " Stardust Dragon ") will Special Summon " Level Eater " by decreasing the Level of "Stardust Dragon" by 1, then tune the "Stardust Dragon" with a Level 1  Tuner monster  for another "Stardust Dragon". 
 If you and your opponent have nearly max number of cards each on the field, the AI will be extremely slow during their turn in all their plays, however once less cards are on the field, the AI will perform its actions quicker again. 
 " Thought Ruler Archfiend " allows you to negate effects that target  Sea Serpent - Type  monsters.
