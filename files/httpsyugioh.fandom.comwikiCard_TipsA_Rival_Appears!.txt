 This card can be searched by " A Cat of Ill Omen ", " Trap Trick " and " Lilith, Lady of Lament ". 
 This card works well in  Special Summoning  Level 4 monsters, since these are the most predominant. 
 If your opponent summons a higher-leveled monster, or uses Level-manipulation effects in order to go into a higher-ranked  Xyz Monster , this card can let you bring out the same Level of monster from your hand for free during your opponent's turn. 
 Use this card to summon a monster to the field at the time its effect can activate like i.e. " Spirit of the Breeze " in attack mode during your Standby Phase or a " Mirage Dragon " after entering your Battle Phase. 
 If this card can survive until your next turn, summon a monster  from your hand to your opponent's field , preferably a high-level monster, then activate this card to bring out a monster of the same Level that cannot bring itself out as easily.
