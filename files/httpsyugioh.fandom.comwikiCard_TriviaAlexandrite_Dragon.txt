 This card was specifically designed with the  TCG  contents of  Photon Shockwave  in mind. [1] 
 This is the first  Normal Monster  to serve as a promotional card for a  TCG  Sneak Peek event. 
 This card is nearly identical to " Gene-Warped Warwolf ", as they are both Level 4  Normal Monsters  with 2000 ATK and 100 DEF. The only differences are their  Types  and  Attributes . 
 "Alexandrite" is a crystalline semi-precious stone which is normally yellowish in daylight. 
 The "czars' lost jewels" in the flavor text may refer to the  Russian Crown Jewels  which were last used to crown Czar Nicolas II and his wife, Empress Alexandra. The jewels went missing for a time after the USSR used them as collateral for a loan from Ireland, which was subsequently thrown into its own revolution.
 Alexander and its variants (Alexei, Alexandra, etc.) were common names in the Russian monarchy.
