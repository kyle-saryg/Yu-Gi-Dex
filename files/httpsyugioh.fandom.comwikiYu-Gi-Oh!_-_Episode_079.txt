 Summary 
 After  Marik 's attempt to defeat  Yugi  and  the Pharaoh  by using his  Millennium Rod  to control his friends backfired, he sets his sights on defeating the Pharaoh at the  Battle City  Finals. Within  Bakura 's mind, Marik convinces  Yami Bakura  to also enter the Battle City Finals.
 Yami Bakura takes over his vessel, the good Bakura's body, steals a  Duel Disk  and  Locator Card  from a random duelist and heads to a graveyard, following a rumor there are  Duels  being held there. Because Yami Bakura disliked the deck that the random duelist had and threw the cards back to him, it is unknown how he got his ghostly deck, although stealing it from another random duelist is the main possibility. There is also the possibility that when Yami Bakura and Marik first met and made their deal, Yami Bakura created a deck before injuring himself and kept it in his pocket, since Marik asked him how good his Dueling skills were while making their deal.
 He finds  Bonz ,  Sid  and  Zygor  dressed in Halloween costumes, terrorizing random duelists in order to obtain Locator Cards without even dueling.
 Even though they'd already obtained five Locator Cards this way, Yami Bakura is not impressed and challenges Bonz to a duel in the  Shadow Realm . Not knowing any better, Bonz accepts.
 Meanwhile, Yugi and  Joey Wheeler  have both qualified for entry into the Battle City Finals. By putting the Locator Cards on the Duel Disk (5 in the  Monster Card Zones  and the last in the  Field Spell Zone ) they receive instructions to go to a stadium which would be the location of the finals.
 
 Major Events 
 Yami Bakura and Bonz begin a Duel in the  Shadow Realm . 
 Whoever wins goes directly to the Finals and the loser would be trapped in the Shadow Realm for all eternity (or Hell in the original). 
 Featured Duel: Yami Bakura vs. Bonz 
 Turn 1: Yami Bakura 
Yami Bakura draws " Headless Knight " and subsequently Normal Summons it (1450/1700) in  Attack Position . He then  Sets  a card.
 Turn 2: Bonz 
Bonz draws " The Snake Hair " and subsequently Normal Summons it (1500/1200) in Attack Position. "Snake Hair"  attacks  and  destroys  "Headless Knight" (Yami Bakura 4000 → 3950).
 Turn 3: Yami Bakura 
Yami Bakura draws. He then  activates  his face-down " The Shallow Grave " to allow both players to  Special Summon  a  monster  from each  Graveyard  in  Defense Position . Yami Bakura Special Summons "Headless Knight" (1450/1700) in Defense Position, but Bonz Special Summons nothing as his Graveyard is currently empty.
 
       The Earl of Demise  is summoned.      Yami Bakura then  Tributes  "Headless Knight" in order to  Tribute Summon  " The Earl of Demise " (2000/700) in Attack Position. "The Earl of Demise" attacks and destroys "Snake Hair" (Bonz 4000 → 3500).
 Turn 4: Bonz 
Bonz draws " Dragon Zombie " and subsequently Normal Summons it (1600/0) in Attack Position. He then activates " Magic Burial " to  pay  800  Life Points  (Bonz 3500 → 2700) and revive "The Snake Hair" (1500/1200) in  Attack Position . Bonz's hand, at this point, contains " Armored Zombie ", "Polymerization", "Skull Invitation", and " Crass Clown ". 
 Bonz then activates " Polymerization " to fuse "Dragon Zombie" with "The Snake Hair" and  Fusion Summon  " Great Mammoth of Goldfine " (2200/1800) in Attack Position. Under  Battle City Rules ,  Fusion Monsters  cannot attack during the same turn they are Fusion Summoned. Bonz Sets a card. He intends to use his set card once "Great Mammoth of Goldfine" attacks and destroys "The Earl of Demise".
 Turn 5: Yami Bakura 
Yami Bakura draws. Bonz activates his face-down " Skull Invitation ". Now whenever a card(s) goes to the Graveyard, the owner of that card(s) will automatically take 300  damage  per card. Yami Bakura then activates " Spiritualistic Medium " to  discard  his entire  hand  and increase the ATK of "The Earl of Demise" by 500 for each card discarded. There were four discarded ("Earl of Demise": 2000 → 4000/700). The effect of "Skull Invitation" then activates (Yami Bakura 3950 → 2750). 
 "The Earl of Demise" attacks and destroys "Great Mammoth of Goldfine" (Bonz 2700 → 900). The effect of "Skull Invitation" then activates (Bonz 900 → 600). At the End Phase, the effect of "Spiritualistic Medium" expires ("The Earl of Demise": 4000 → 2000/700).
 Turn 6: Bonz 
Bonz draws " Nightmare's Steelcage " and subsequently activates it. Now no monsters can attack for two turns. Bonz then Sets a monster.
 Turn 7: Yami Bakura 
Yami Bakura draws " Ectoplasmer " and subsequently activates it. Now both players, during each of their turns, can choose up to two types of monsters to be converted into ectoplasm, with half of the turn player's Tributed monsters' ATK being inflicted as damage to their opponents. Yami Bakura activates the effect of "Ectoplasmer" and selects "Fiend" for its effect, which causes "The Earl of Demise" to be Tributed (Bonz 600 → 0).
 
 Epilogue 
 By losing the duel, Bonz, Sid and Zygor are banished to the Shadow Realm (Hell in the original). 
 Yami Bakura obtains his sixth Locator Card, qualifying for the Battle City Finals. 
 Differences in Adaptations 
 Cut from the dub are two  I-Spy -esque scenes (the first depicting a space environment with planets and spaceships and the other showcasing things like people, land vehicles and doll) before Bakura speaks with Marik for the first time. 
 The blood on Bakura's arm wound is removed from the dub. 
 Cut from the dub is a scene of Yami Bakura ripping the IV needle out of his arm after he knocks out Solomon. 
 "The Earl of Demise" slicing "The Snake Hair" in half is obscured in the dub. 
 In the dub, Bakura identifies the dark creatures in the cemetery as lost souls who were sent to the Shadow Realm. In the original version, they are "death gods" (the Japanese equivalent of the Grim Reaper). 
 The shadows that consume Bonz, Sid and Zygor are made glowy in the dub 
 Cut from the dub is the last scene in the episode where Yugi and the group are traveling to the location of the finals in Mai's car, and Kaiba flies overhead in his helicopter. The dubbed episode ends with Yami Bakura monologing his plans. 
 In the original broadcast of the episode, after they learn of what their fate will be, Sid tells Bonz "Don't you bloody lose!". Future airings of the episode and the DVD versions change the line to "Don't you dare lose!", as the word bloody is a minor obscenity in the UK. 
 Errors 
 In the Dub, Bonz declares that the card he Sets during his last turn is a Magic card. However, based on what was shown to be in his hand during his previous turn, he shouldn't have had any more Magic or Trap cards to Set.
