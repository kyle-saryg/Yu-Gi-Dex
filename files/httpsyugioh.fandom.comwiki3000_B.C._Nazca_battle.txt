 History 
 The  People of the Stars ' lived in the Inca civilization, the  Stairway to the Dragon Star , under the guidance of the  Star Dragon King . However the wicked gods threatened their lands. Seeking help the King prayed to their God, the  Dragon Star  for salvation. The Dragon Star responded by sending the  Crimson Dragon  to fight the disturbances.
 The Crimson Dragon fought the wicked gods, with the help of five of  its servants . They forced to the Gods into the earth, sealing them in geoglyphs, which came to be known as the  Nazca Lines . However, as the  Uru  was sealed it sent out a web at  Ancient Fairy Dragon  and dragged her in with them.
 
 References to the battle 
 5000 years later, as  Rex Goodwin  told some of the story to Yusei,  Luna  had a dream about the battle.
 The  Dark Signers  tried reliving that battle as the Earthbound Immortals possessed them to fight the  Signers , the modern day wielders of the Crimson Dragon's servants.
 Much like how the Earthbound Immortals took Ancient Fairy Dragon, the Dark Signers held the " Ancient Fairy Dragon " card for a while.
