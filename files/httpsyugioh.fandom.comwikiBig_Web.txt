 Manga events 
 The  Muscle Hunters  went here to spend the money they were given by the  Junky Scorpion owner  for stealing back a pair of  Air Muscle  shoes that he sold to  Jonouchi . Jonouchi,  Honda  and  Yugi  then found them here and beat them up to try and get back the shoes. [3] 
 Honda,  Anzu  and Yugi passed the arcade while searching for Jonouchi after he missed school. [4] 
 The high scores on many of the games were connected to arcades across the country and under the name KAI,  Seto Kaiba  achieved the highest score on many of the games. Yugi and Jonouchi went to the arcade once with Jonouchi set on beating one of Kaiba's scores. While he tried that, Yugi played  Virtual VS  and kept getting challenged to games by  Street Fighter , who was also in the arcade. Angered over constantly losing, Street Fighter beat-up Yugi in reality and stole his  Millennium Puzzle . However Jonouchi went after Street Fighter and beat him a real fighting game, winning back the Millennium Puzzle. [2] 
 Dark Yugi  and Anzu went here among other places when they went on a date. Anzu was challenged to a game of  Super Dancer  by  Step Johnny , which she won. [5]

 In the reconstruction of Domino City within the  Virtual World , there was an exit to the real world.  Noah Kaiba  used this to escape in  Mokuba Kaiba 's body. Afterwards he had a change of heart and helped Yugi, his friends and  Seto Kaiba  escape. Noah then returned to the virtual world to allow Mokuba to return to the real world in his own body. [6]
