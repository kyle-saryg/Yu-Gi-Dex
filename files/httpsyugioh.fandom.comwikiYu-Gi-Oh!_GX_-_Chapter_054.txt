 The Terror of the Forbidden Beasts!! 
 
 "Looming... Darkness!"  is the fifty-fourth chapter of the  Yu-Gi-Oh! GX  manga . It was first printed in Japanese in the  V Jump  magazine and in English in the  Shonen Jump  magazine. Both of which were printed in  volume 8  of the  Yu-Gi-Oh! GX  graphic novels afterwards.
 Tragoedia  gathers new pawns to use his quest to gain  the spirit card . The next phase of the tournament begins - the singles matches.  Jaden  begins his confrontation with  Adrian .
 
 Summary 
 As " Vision Hero Trinity "  attacks   Atticus , he attempts to  activate  his  face-down  " Air Barrier " to defend himself and his " Troposphere ". However,  Tragoedia , watching nearby through  Principal MacKenzie , prevents him from activating it, as darkness envelops him. The attack hits, and Atticus loses. After Aster leaves, MacKenzie reveals himself, and makes Atticus his newest pawn. Seeing  Adrian  nearby, he does the same to him.
 The next day,  Dr. Crowler  gathers the  Duel Academy  representatives to choose the pairings for the singles matches. Each of them is given a card with the picture of a location on the island printed on it. Each of the American students get one as well, and they are to meet their opponents at the given location.  Jaden  gets the mountain,  Syrus  the beach,  Alexis  the pier,  Chazz  the cliff and  Bastion  the forest.
 Aster meets with Principal MacKenzie, who gifts him with what he describes as the final card in the " Legendary Planet " series. He states that the series was designed by  Aster's father  and that he would have wanted Aster to have the card. MacKenzie says he waited until Aster had matured to give him the card and that he regards him as his own son.
 Jaden goes to the forested area of the mountain to meet his opponent, who turns out to be Adrian. The two begin their  Duel  and Adrian Summons " Forbidden Beast Inun " early on. Jaden notes that he would't have that if he has " Forbidden Mantra ". Jaden knows that Adrain is going to use the effect of his Forbidden Beast to bring his "Forbidden Mantra" from his deck to his hand and plans to prevent that. Jaden summons " Masked Hero Gust " and then activates the spell card " Mask Function 1 " which prevents a opponent's monster from activating its effect as long as there is a "Masked Hero" on the field. Jaden attacks "Forbidden Beast Inun" with "Masked Hero Gust", destroying it. Jaden notes that with his Forbidden Beast gone, Adrain cannot get "Forbidden Mantra" from his deck to his hand, however Adrian activates his face-down trap card " Beast-Concealed Mantra " which allow him to add "Forbidden Mantra" to his hand when a "Forbidden Beast" has been destroyed, Jaden plays one card face-down and end his turn. Adrain activates "Forbidden Mantra" and special summons two " Forbidden Beast Nunurao " then he sacrifices both of his monsters to summon " Forbidden Beast Nibunu ". Adrian then uses Nibun's effect to summon one "Forbidden Beast" from the Graveyard and he chooses "Forbidden Beast Inun" which Jaden knows he is going to bring another "Forbidden Mantra" from his deck to his hand. Adrian says to Jaden that his gold star is out of reach and his black marks suit him best.
