       A Set  Monster Card     
       A Set  Spell / Trap Card     
 To  Set  (Japanese: セット  Setto ) is to place a card  face-down  on the  field .
 Monster Cards  can be  Normal Set  from the  hand  in the  Monster Zones , which places them in face-down  Defense Position  on the field. Each player can only perform 1  Normal Summon  or Set per turn.
 With the exception of  Field Spell Cards  (which are Set in the  Field Zone ),  Spell  and  Trap Cards  are Set in the  Spell & Trap Card Zones . Cards that are Set in the Spell & Trap Zone or Field Zone are placed vertically.
 Pendulum Monsters  cannot be Set in the  Pendulum Zone  as  Spell Cards . Prior to the introduction of  Extra Monster Zones , Pendulum Zones were separate zones, so no cards could be Set in them; after the introduction of Extra Monster Zones, two Spell & Trap Zones are used as Pendulum Zones instead, although they are not treated as Pendulum Zones if there is not a Pendulum Monster in them (such as if a Spell or Trap Card is Set in them).
 Flipping  a card on the field face-down (such as by the effect of " Book of Moon " or " Scrap-Iron Scarecrow ") and  Special Summoning  a monster in face-down position (such as by the effect of " The Shallow Grave " or " Magical Hats ") are both forms of Setting. [1] [2]
