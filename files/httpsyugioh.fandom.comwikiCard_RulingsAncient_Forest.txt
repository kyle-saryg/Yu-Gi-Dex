 If a monster battles and is then flipped face-down, then the effect of " Ancient Forest " will still destroy it at the end of the  Battle Phase . [3] 
 The effect " if a monster attacks, it is destroyed at the end of the  Battle Phase " of " Ancient Forest "  activates  and starts a  Chain . [4] 
 When " Gladiator Beast Alexander " battles while " Ancient Forest " is active, both effects are to resolve at the end of the  Battle Phase , so the Turn Player can choose to resolve his effects first.  If the same player controls both " Gladiator Beast Alexander " and " Ancient Forest ", then the effects resolve in the order that the player chooses. [5] 
 If a monster's attack is negated by an effect like " Magic Cylinder ", then the monster will not be destroyed by the effect of " Ancient Forest " at the end of the  Battle Phase . [6] 
 The effect, " When this card is activated, if there are any Defense Position monsters on the field, then those monsters are changed to face-up Attack Position. " of " Ancient Forest " is not applied at  activation  - it is applied when  resolving  the effect, after the opponent has had the chance to  chain  to the effect.  If " Mystical Space Typhoon " is  chained  to the activation of " Ancient Forest ", then " Ancient Forest " is not face-up on the field when its effect is resolving as Chain Link 1, so the monsters are not changed to face-up Attack Position.
