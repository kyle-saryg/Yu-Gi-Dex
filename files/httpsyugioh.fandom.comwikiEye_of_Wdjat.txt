       Eye of Wdjat     
       Eye of Wdjat in the anime     
 The  Eye of Wdjat , also known as the  Eye of Horus  or simply the  wdjat , is an Ancient Egyptian symbol, appearing various times throughout  Yu-Gi-Oh!  media. In Egyptian mythology, Wdjat was the protector goddess of Lower Egypt, and the eye symbol used by her was slightly altered to create the Eye of Horus.  It is a symbol of protection and heavily associated with the pharaohs.
 A different eye, called the  Eye of Anubis  or Millennium Symbol, is a fictional invention of  Yu-Gi-Oh!  and prominently features throughout the series; as such it is sometimes stylized to resemble the  wdjat , such as on the  Millennium Puzzle .
 Yet another eye associated with the  wdjat , the Eye of Ra, is derived from real-life Egyptian art in which it is depicted as the solar disk itself; this eye is less prominent in  Yu-Gi-Oh!  than the Eye of Horus and the Eye of Anubis, but serves as the inspiration for  the Winged Dragon of Ra 's  Sphere Mode .
 
 Appearances

This same stylized  wdjat  appeared on the door to the afterlife in the  Shrine of the Millennium Stone . After the  Ceremonial Battle ,  Atem  spoke his name to the Eye, causing the door to open.
