"Possession" redirects here. For the composition, see  "Possession" (composition) .   
       " Dotedotengu ", a card whose activation timing mentions possession     
 Possess  is the term used to describe who has a card at a given time. It is similar to the term  control , but it also applies to locations other than the  field , such as the  hand  or  Deck .
 This term was first introduced via  Problem-Solving Card Text  in  Legendary Collection 3: Yugi's World , in the updated card text of " Dark Necrofear ". [Notes 1]  It was then used in  Abyss Rising , in the card text of the " Madolche " cards.
 Cards considered to be in a particular player's possession are all of the following: [1] 
 
 cards on that player's side of the field 
 cards in that player's  hand ,  Main Deck ,  Extra Deck , or  Graveyard 
 that player's  banished  cards 
 cards in the middle of being Summoned to that player's side of the field 
 cards  attached  as  Xyz Materials  to an  Xyz Monster(s)  that player controls

 Notes 
 
 ↑   More recent reprints of "Dark Necrofear" no longer use "possession" as a term in their card texts, due to the  activation conditions  of "Dark Necrofear" having changed since then.
