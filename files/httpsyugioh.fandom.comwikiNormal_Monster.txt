 Normal Monsters  (Japanese:  通 常 モンスター  Tsūjō Monsutā ), colored yellow, are  Main Deck   monsters  with no  monster effects . In the card description box (which contains the effect on  Effect Monsters ), Normal Monsters include a brief description of its lore. Starting from  Starter Deck: Link Strike  onwards, all Normal Monsters also include the designation "/Normal" on their  Type / Ability  lines.
 Only Monster Cards with "yellow" backgrounds are Normal Monsters. There are  Tuner  and  Pendulum  Normal Monsters, such as " Tune Warrior " and " Flash Knight ".  Monster Tokens  are also Normal Monsters.  Non-Effect   Fusion ,  Ritual ,  Synchro ,  Xyz  and  Link  Monsters are not Normal Monsters. Some non-Normal Monsters can be  treated as Normal Monsters with card effects , most notably  Gemini monsters  and some  Trap Monsters . 
 The card text (or  flavor text ) on Normal Monsters is for illustrative purposes only, and has no effect on gameplay (except  archetype conditions , such as on " Summoned Skull " and " Gazelle the King of Mythical Beasts " in the English  TCG ). These texts provide lore on how the monster is related to other cards in the game, such as the flavor text of " Opticlops " which explicitly states that it serves " Dark Ruler Ha Des ".

 Play style 
 Though they do not have inherent effects, there are often  Spell ,  Trap , or  Monster  effects associated with specific Normal Monsters. For example, " Dark Magic Attack " can only be used with " Dark Magician ", " Huge Revolution " can only be activated with 3 specific Normal Monsters on the field, and " X-Head Cannon ", " V-Tiger Jet " and " Dark Blade " are the specific targets for three specific  Union monsters .
 Normal Monsters have received some very powerful support cards for general use, such as " Birthright ", " Summoner's Art ", " Knight of the Red Lotus ", " Princess Cologne ", " Terratiger " and " Ventdra, the Empowered Warrior ", " White Tiger " and " Blue Dragon Summoner ", " Dark Factory of Mass Production ", and " Creepy Coney ". The Normal  Pendulum Monsters  " Dragon Horn Hunter ", " Lancephorhynchus ", and the " Draconia "  series  support Normal Monsters. " Thunder End Dragon " has a powerful effect, but requires 2 Normal Monsters in order to be  Xyz Summoned .
 " Rescue Rabbit " can Special Summon 2  Level  4 or lower Normal Monsters from the Deck, providing quick access to Xyz Monsters; this effect is so useful that  Dino Rabbit  Decks are built entirely around it.
 Some Normal Monster support focuses on low-Level Normal Monsters (typically Level 3 or lower). There are cards that allow the Special Summon of large numbers of low-Level Normal Monsters from the Deck (such as " Human-Wave Tactics " and " Enchanting Fitting Room "), to then be powered up with cards like " Triangle Power ", " Amulet of Ambition ", and " Sword of the Soul-Eater ", or used to get rid of the opponent's cards with " The Law of the Normal ".

 Trivia 
 Normal Monsters were the most common monsters when the  Duel Monsters  card game was introduced in the  manga  and released in the  OCG  and  TCG , but as the game's strategies evolved, Effect Monsters became more common and fewer Normal Monsters were released or reprinted. For a time, very few  Booster Packs  contain Normal Monsters, and even those that do contain very few. Following the introduction of  Pendulum Monsters , however, Normal Monsters have seen a resurgence in Booster Packs, mainly in the form of Normal Pendulum Monsters.
 In  Yu-Gi-Oh! 5D's - Episode 121 ,  Jack Atlas  mentioned this. 
 The Normal Monster with the highest ATK is " Blue-Eyes White Dragon ", at 3000. " Labyrinth Wall ", " Neo Aqua Madoor " ," Millennium Shield ", " Dragon Core Hexer " and the  Illegal  card " Leonardo's Silver Skyship " have the highest DEF, at 3000. " Rabidragon " has the highest combined ATK and DEF, with 2950 ATK and 2900 DEF. 
 " Leonardo's Silver Skyship " is the first  Match winner  Normal Monster, due to being a Pendulum Monster. 
 " Thousand-Eyes Idol " is the Normal Monster with the lowest stats, being Level 1 monster with 0 ATK and 0 DEF. 
 " Gunkan Suship Shari " has the longest flavor text of all Normal Monsters. 
 " Mekk-Knight Avram " has the shortest flavor text of all Normal Monsters. 
 " Thunder End Dragon " is the only  Xyz Monster  that requires Normal Monsters as its  Xyz Materials . 
 Yuma Tsukumo  and  Yuya Sakaki  are the only main protagonists to have never used a Normal Monster. 
 There are currently no Level 9 or higher Normal Monsters. 
 " Clavkiys, The Magikey Skyblaster " has the highest combined ATK and DEF of any Level 4 Normal Monster.
