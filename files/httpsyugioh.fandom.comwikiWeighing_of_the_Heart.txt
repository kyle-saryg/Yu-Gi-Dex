      Section of the Book of the Dead depicting the Weighing of the Heart     
 The  Weighing of the Heart  (最後の審判 [1]   Saigo no Shinpan  "Final Judgment"), also known as the  Judgment of the Dead , is a ritual in Ancient Egyptian religion that is used to judge whether the soul of a dead person may pass to the afterlife or if they should be fed to the soul eating  Ammit .
 In the  manga  and  toei anime , holders of the  Millennium Scale  are capable of performing the same ritual to living people to determine if they should be punished.
 According to the manga, this Final Judgment is decribed in chapter 125 of a sacred book known as the  Psychostasia  ( 死者の書   Pushukosutashia ). [1] [Note 1]

 Procedure 
 The  Feather of Ma'at  is placed in one side of a set of a scales. This side represents the good deeds of the person being judged. The other side represents their bad deeds. If the side of good deeds outweighs that of the bad deeds, the person may pass to the afterlife. If their bad deeds outweigh their good deeds, they would have their soul devoured by  Ammit .  Osiris  would be the judge at the ritual, while  Anubis  would hold the scales.
 Individuals who hold the  Millennium Scales  are also capable of performing this test, although they do it on living people to measure their sins. It is sometimes done in the form of a  Shadow Game , where the individual being tested may be subject to a  Penalty Game  if they have a high level of bad deeds.
