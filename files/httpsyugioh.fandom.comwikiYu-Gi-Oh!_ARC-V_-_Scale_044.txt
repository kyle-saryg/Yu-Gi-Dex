 Summary 
 Both sides armed with  Action Cards ,  Reiji  and  Yuya  try to outsmart the other. With their G.O.D. cards returned to the field, the two cleverly use their last remaining cards.
 
 Featured Duel: Yuya Sakaki vs. Reiji Akaba 
 Duel continues from the previous Scale . 
 Turn 8: Yuya 
As  Yuya  has  Special Summoned  the  Pendulum Scale  10 " Dark Anthelion Dragon " using " Pendulum Match ", Reiji Special Summons " D/D/D/D Super-Dimensional Sovereign Emperor Zero Paradox " (3000/3000) from his Deck. The latter's  effect  activates, destroying all cards on the field: " EnterMate BaroKuriboh ", "Dark Anthelion Dragon" and "Pendulum Match", as well as " Go-D/D Ark ", " Go-D/D Evil " and " Go-D/D World ". As the  Battle Phase  has ended, "D/D/D/D Super-Dimensional Sovereign Emperor Zero Paradox" is destroyed by the effect of "Pendulum Match". Yuya activates the  Action Card  " The Show Must Go On ", which allows Yuya to randomly take two Action Cards from Reiji's  hand . 
 Yuya activates the Action Card " Big Dominoes ", which inflicts  effect damage  equal to the number of cards both players have in their hand times 500. Reiji and Yuya have 7 cards, which sums the damage to 3500. As Reiji is to take effect damage, he activates the Action Card " Reverse Dominos " to redirects that damage to Yuya. Yuya actvates the Action Card " Swingmelon ", which redirects that damage to Reiji, and doubles that damage. As Reiji is to take Effect damage, he plays the Action Card " Stop ", reducing the damage he would've have taken to 0. Finally, Yuya uses " Splash Seeds ", which inflicts damage to both players, equal to the number of Action Cards sent this turn times 500, which equals 2500 (Reiji: 4000 → 1500 LP). Yuya sets a card.
 Turn 9: Reiji 
Yuya obtains an Action Card. Due to the effect of " EnterMate Turntrooper ", on the third turn after its effect was activated, " Divine Go-D/D/D Zero King Zero G.O.D. Reiji " and " G.O.D.-Eyes Phantom Dragon " return to the field. Reiji Normal Summons " D/D Destiny Surveyor " (0/???). Yuya activates the set card, " Trick Explanation ", which prevents Reiji from  tributing   monsters  for monster effects. Reiji uses the effect of "Destiny Surveyor",  equipping  it to "Divine Go-D/D/D Zero King Zero G.O.D. Reiji"; as long as the latter is equipped by it, any damage Reiji would receive from battles becomes zero and the monster is not destroyed by battle. "Divine Go-D/D/D Zero King Zero G.O.D. Reiji" attacks "G.O.D.-Eyes Phantom Dragon".
 Yuya sends "Trick Explanation" to his Graveyard to activate its effect, destroying "D/D Destiny Surveyor" that is treated as an Equip Card. Reiji  banishes  "Destiny Surveyor" to reduce the damage he'd taken to zero, then destroys "G.O.D.-Eyes Phantom Dragon" and inflicts damage to Yuya equal to half the ATK of that monster. Yuya activates the Action Card " Double Burst ", so both players take 1500 LP damage. As an effect damage would reduce his LP to 0, Reiji sends " D/D Zero Surveyor " from his hand to the GY, and reduces that damage so that Reiji and Yuya have 100 LP left (Reiji: 1500 → 100 LP; Yuya: 1500 → 100 LP).
 Duel continues in the next Scale .
