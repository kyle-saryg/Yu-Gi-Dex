 Yami Yugi ,  Joey Wheeler ,  Seto Kaiba  and  Yami Marik  faced each other in a game of  Duel Monsters , during the  Battle City  arc, in the  Yu-Gi-Oh!  anime . It is based on the same duel from the  manga .
 
 Prior Events 
 After the events of the  Virtual World  arc, which  Seto Kaiba  proclaimed  never happened , the Semi-Finals of the Battle City Tournament can now begin. To determine turn order, the four semi-finalists,  Yami Yugi ,  Joey Wheeler , Seto Kaiba and  Yami Marik , will have a battle royale, to determine who will face who in the tournament. The rules were simple: the first two duelists to lose will face each other in the first match, while the last two will face each other in the second match.
 The rules:
 
 Each duelist must play with no more than 40 cards. 
 Each duelist can attack whoever they want, but can not attack until one turn has passed. 
 Each player must select one monster to determine turn order and the monster with the highest ATK gets to go first, but the card they select must be removed from play until the battle royale is finished. 
 The duel commences.
 
 Featured Duel: Yami Yugi vs. Joey Wheeler vs. Seto Kaiba vs. Yami Marik 
 Turn order is determined as follows: Seto Kaiba, who chose " Masked Beast Des Gardius ", which has an ATK of 3300 → Yami Marik who chose " Lekunga " whose ATK is 1700 → Yami Yugi who chose " Feral Imp " whose ATK is 1300 → Joey Wheeler who chose " Swordsman of Landstar " whose ATK is 500
 Turn 1: Kaiba 
Kaiba draws. He then Sets a card and Normal Summons " Vorse Raider " (1900/1200) in Attack Position.
 Turn 2: Yami Marik 
Yami Marik draws " Newdoria " and subsequently Normal Summons it (1200/800) in Defense Position.
 Turn 3: Yami Yugi 
Yami Yugi draws. He then Normal Summons " Big Shield Gardna " (100/2600) in Defense Position and Sets two cards.
 Turn 4: Joey 
Joey draws "Graverobber". Joey's hand contains " Skull Dice ", " The Legendary Fisherman ", " Foolish Burial ", " Jinzo ", " Insect Queen ", and " Graverobber ". Joey Sets a card ("Graverobber").
 Turn 5: Kaiba 
Kaiba draws. Kaiba's hand contains " Ring of Defense ", " Ring of Destruction ", " Blue-Eyes White Dragon ", " Pot of Greed ", and " Shrink ". "Vorse Raider" attacks Joey directly, but Yugi activates his face-down " The Regulation of Tribe " by declaring "Beast-Warrior" for its effect. As a result, "Vorse Raider" can't attack while "The Regulation of Tribe" is face-up. Also during each of Yugi's Standby Phases, he must Tribute one monster to keep "The Regulation of Tribe" on the field or else it will be destroyed.
 
All players still have 4000  Life Points  remaining.

 Turn 6: Yami Marik 
Yami Marik draws. He then Sets a card and Normal Summons " Lord Poison " (1500/1000) in Attack Position. Yami Marik then switches " Newdoria " (1200/800) to Attack Position. "Newdoria" then attacks " Vorse Raider ". "Vorse Raider" destroys "Newdoria", but the effect of "Newdoria" then activates, destroying "Vorse Raider". Yami Marik then activates " Spell of Pain " to redirect the Battle Damage he would have taken to Joey instead (Joey 4000 → 3300).
 Turn 7: Yami Yugi 
Yugi draws. He then chooses not to pay the  Maintenance Cost  for "The Regulation of Tribe", so it is destroyed. He then Tributes " Big Shield Gardna " in order to Tribute Summon " Beast of Gilfer " (2200/2500) in Attack Position. "Beast of Gilfer" attacks Seto directly, but Seto activates his face-down " Attack Guidance Armor " to redirect the attack to Marik's "Lord Poison". Marik activates his face-down " Mirror Force " to destroy all Attack Position monsters on Yugi's side of the field, but Yugi activates his face-down " Seven Tools of the Bandit " to negate and destroy "Mirror Force" by paying 1000 Life Points (Yugi 4000 → 3000). "Beast of Gilfer" then destroys "Lord Poison" (Marik 4000 → 3300).
 Turn 8: Joey 
Joey draws " Gearfried the Iron Knight " and subsequently Normal Summons it (1800/1600) in Attack Position. "Gearfried the Iron Knight" then attacks Kaiba directly (Seto 4000 → 2200). Joey Sets a card.
 Turn 9: Kaiba 
Kaiba draws. He then Sets three cards and Normal Summons " Blade Knight " (1600/1000) in Attack Position. Kaiba then uses "Blade Knight" to attack Marik directly (Marik 3300 → 1700).

 Joey has 3300 Life Points remaining and controls " Gearfried the Iron Knight " (1800/1600) in Attack Position and two set cards.
 Turn 10: Yami Marik 
Yami Marik draws. He then Normal Summons " Dark Jeroid " (1200/1500) in Attack Position. Since "Dark Jeroid" was summoned, Yami Marik activates the effect of "Dark Jeroid" to reduce the ATK of "Gearfried the Iron Knight" by 800 ("Gearfried the Iron Knight": 1800 → 1000/1600).
 "Dark Jeroid" attacks "Gearfried the Iron Knight", but Joey activates his face-down " Skull Dice " to roll a die and divide the ATK of "Dark Jeroid" by the result. Joey gets a two ("Dark Jeroid": 1200 → 600/1500). Seto then activates his face-down " Shrink " to halve "Gearfried the Iron Knight's" ATK ("Gearfried the Iron Knight": 1000 → 500/1600) until the End Phase. "Dark Jeroid" then destroys "Gearfried the Iron Knight" (Joey 3300 → 3200). On Yami Marik's End Phase, the effect of "Skull Dice" expires ("Dark Jeroid" 600 → 1200/1500).
 Turn 11: Yami Yugi 
Yami Yugi draws. He then tries to use " Beast of Gilfer " to attack Yami Marik's "Dark Jeroid", but Joey convinces him to attack him instead. "Beast of Gilfer" then attacks Joey directly (Joey 3200 → 1000).
 Turn 12: Joey 
Joey draws " Axe Raider " and subsequently Normal Summons it (1700/1150) in Attack Position. "Axe Raider" attacks " Blade Knight ", but Seto activates his face-down " Ring of Destruction " to destroy "Axe Raider" and inflict damage to him and Joey equal to the ATK of "Axe Raider". Seto then activates his face-down " Ring of Defense " to prevent "Ring of Destruction's" effect from inflicting damage to him. Joey then activates his face-down " Graverobber " to steal " Spell of Pain " from Marik's Graveyard and activate it as his card, allowing Joey to redirect the damage he would have taken to Yami Marik instead (Marik 1700 → 0).
 Yami Marik loses.
 Turn 13: Kaiba 
Kaiba draws. "Blade Knight" then attacks Joey directly (Joey 1000 → 0). 
 Joey loses.
