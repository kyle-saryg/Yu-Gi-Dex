 In New Domino City, the hottest game in town is the Turbo Duel, fought from blazingly fast motorcycles called Duel Runners. On the outskirts of New Domino City, in a district known as Satellite, a new Turbo Duel hero emerges—Yusei Fudo! On his custom-built Duel Runner, Yusei takes on all challengers, fighting for his friends and the future of Satellite! [1] 
 Eternal Turbo Duelist!! 
 Yusei and Goodwin are locked in their final Duel. Having now harnessed the power of the Ultimate God, Goodwin can turn Yusei's Duel Dragons against him. The assault may be more than Yusei can bear and he will need his friends' help to have any chance of winning, but will it be enough? [2]
