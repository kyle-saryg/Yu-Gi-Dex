 Summary 
 Mr. Heartland  acts as a commentator for the  Duel Coaster . He says the  Triad of Terror  waited for the late player,  Yuma Tsukumo  and that the three had used team play tactics to get through the preliminaries. Heartland says it will be a  Duel  the crowd will not want to take their eyes off of and then yells "heart burning!"  Bronk  yells for Yuma not to lose, while  Cathy  tells him to  kyattobing .  Vetrix  giggles, saying he's looking forward to seeing how these bounty hunters will try to take Yuma down. He recalls the meeting he and  Quinton  had with them. Quinton had said they will pay them any amount they desire.  Wolfsbane  says that they've established a contract then and says they'll break him just as Vetrix wishes. Vetrix now says that breaking him isn't enough - he wants to see Yuma's true strength. The Triad begins changing lanes to assault Yuma by ramming him. With them blocking him from switching his own lane, he determines he has no choice but to fight. 
 
         The powered-up " Magnet Saucer "  attacks .     
 Yuma  Normal Summons  " Gagaga Caesar " in  Attack Position . He orders it to  attack  the " Magnet Saucer " in front of him. "Kaiser" dashes through the air while "Magnet Saucer" shoots laser blasts at him. "Kaiser" dodges and destroys "Saucer", dropping  Jackal 's  Life Points  to 3600. Yuma is excited, but  Astral  tells him this isn't the time to celebrate and instructs him to look at their  monsters . " Magnet Eagle Delta " and the remaining "Magnet Saucer" have both gained 400  ATK . Yuma asks why that happened and Wolf explains that its the  effects  of the " Magnet " monsters. He tells him that when certain "Magnet" monsters are destroyed, the ATK of others increases.  Coyote  laughs and changes lanes so he's in front of Yuma and says the real fight begins now. He orders his own "Magnet Saucer" to attack "Gagaga Caesar", resulting in the destruction of both monsters. The ATK of "Eagle Delta" increases by 400 as a result, so Wolf attacks  directly  with it, reducing Yuma to 1000 Life Points. Wolf says that with that, the first battle has ended, so the ATK of "Eagle Delta" returns to its  original value  of 1200. 
 Vetrix seems surprised, saying that shouldn't be all of Yuma's strength and to show him more power. On another lane,  Kite  is confronting  another finalist . He says he has no time to deal with those that don't possess " Numbers " and attacks his opponent directly with " Reverse Buster ", defeating him. He says he will make both Vetrix and Quinton disappear when he gets to them.  Dextra  passes him in another lane and whispers for him not to push himself (Kite's duel is cut from the dub). Mr. Heartland says there are battles going on all over, but the most intense one is Yuma vs. the Triad of Terror. He asks if Yuma will become their sacrifice and yells "heart burning" again. Jackal and Coyote Normal Summon " Magnet Ape Epsilon " and " Magnet Crocodile Zeta ", respectively.  Tori  says their monsters have surrounded them again and Yuma adds that even if he destroyed one by battle, the others will just get an ATK boost. Yuma is unsure what to do, but Astral suggests he plays the " Gogogo Golem " he has in his  hand , as it isn't destroyed by battle once per  turn  when its in  Defense Position . Yuma says he could try to change lanes after the second attack as well. 
 
         Coyote  and  Jackal  change lanes to prevent Yuma's escapes.     
 Yuma Normal Summons "Gogogo Golem" in Defense Position. Wolf says the second battle begins now and Coyote orders "Crocodile Zeta" to attack with  "Bolt Bite" . It is not destroyed, so Jackal tells "Ape Epsilon" to attack with  "Ape Punch" . "Gogogo Golem" is destroyed and Astral yells for Yuma to change lanes now before the third attack is declared. Coyote says they knew he would try that. He and Jackal both change lanes, blocking Yuma from doing the same on both sides. Astral says this is the team play of the Triad of Terror. Wolfsbane says Yuma's Life Points are only 1000 and the ATK of "Eagle Delta" is 1200 - if the attack goes through, Jackal says they'll fulfill their agreement with Vetrix and Coyote adds that the big reward will be theirs. Yuma doesn't know what to do and Wolfsbane says its over, ordering "Eagle Delta" to attack. A horn sounds as " Rocket Arrow Express " roars onto the field, nearly crushing "Eagle Delta". A cloaked  Duelist  changes lanes and ends up between Yuma and Wolfsbane. Yuma asks who it is and the figure says that a 3 vs. 1 Duel is very unfair. She takes off the cloak, revealing herself to be  Anna . She gives Yuma a thumbs-up and says she'll help him out.
 
         " Rocket Arrow Express "  destroys  " Magnet Crocodile Zeta ".     
 Yuma and Tori recall when  Anna tried to kill them  and Yuma asks why she's here. She says they'll talk later and orders "Rocket Arrow" to attack. Wolfsbane is dumbfounded, as "Rocket Arrow" has 5000 ATK. Coyote changes lanes, interposing himself between Wolfsbane and Anna and saying he'll take this one. Wolfsbane changes lanes and "Rocket Arrow" destroys "Crocodile Zeta", dropping Coyote's Life Points to to 600. The ATKs of "Eagle Delta" and "Ape Epsilon" both rise by 400. Yuma says Anna saved him, but recalls her saying she hadn't entered the  World Duel Carnival . She says men shouldn't worry about small details like that. "Rocket Arrow" suddenly explodes and Tori and Yuma question why - no one attacked. Astral says that "Rocket Arrow" destroys itself after battling unless the  controller   sends  five cards from their hand to the  Graveyard . Yuma asks how Anna could forget a detail like that and she again tells him not to worry about details. 
 Coyote asks what they're talking about and  activates  " Magnet Reborn ", which lets him  pay  500 Life Points to  Special Summon  a "Magnet" monster from his Graveyard. "Crocodile Zeta" reappears and attacks Anna directly, with Yuma telling her to run away. She changes lanes and ends up behind Wolfsbane, who calls her annoying and says they'll take care of her first. Yuma yells that Anna hit a Draw Point, so she can  draw . She does so and Normal Summons " Lionhearted Locomotive " in Attack Position. Wolfsbane activates " Magnet Fusion " and explains that he can  Tribute  "Eagle Delta", "ape Epsilon" and "Crocodile Zeta" to  Fusion Summon  " Electromagnetic Magnedragon ". It appears in Attack Position, roaring. Anna is surprised at its 3500 ATK as Wolfsbane smirks. Tori says Anna is in trouble and Yuma says that this time, he'll save her. He Normal Summons " Bull Blader " in Attack Position and tells Anna to wait for him as he changes over to her lane. Jackal changes lanes first, landing right in front of Yuma and saying he won't allow that. Tori says there's another place they can change lanes ahead. Jackal says he won't let that happen and draws. He Normal Summons " Magnet Mannequin ", while Coyote draws and Normal Summons " Magnet Jammer ". Wolfsbane orders "Magnedragon" to attack "Lionhearted Locomotive" with  "Magnet Inferno" . "Lionhearted Locomotive" is destroyed and Wolf explains that the effect of "Magnedragon" can inflict  damage  to the destroyed monster's controller if it destroys a monster by battle. Between that effect and the  Battle Damage , Anna's Life Points fall to 500. 
 Tori says that Anna will lose if this continues. Astral says they are surrounded on all sides, but Yuma says he'll open a path. He attacks and destroys "Mannequin" with "Bull Blader", dropping Jackal to 3000 Life Points. Jackal explains that the effect of "Mannequin" inflicts 200 damage when its destroyed, so Yuma's Life Points fall to 800. Then Jackal activates "Magnet Reborn", paying 500 Life Points to revive "Magnet Mannequin". Jackal tells them to bring it on and that they'll continue to deplete Yuma's Life Points. Yuma says if they keep doing this, their Life Points will hit 0 as well. Jackal says they are fine with that and Coyote says they are a team - it doesn't matter if he and Jackal are defeated as long as Wolfsbane remains. Wolfsbane says they'll get a huge reward for defeating him. Yuma and Astral are both surprised. Wolf says they don't care for victory, only money. Yuma asks who hired them and Wolfsbane responds with "who knows?" while Coyote and Jackal laugh. Anna draws " Express Train Trolley Olley " and remarks that this is the only monster she can Summon. She says it can't be helped and does so in Defense Position. Wolfsbane says a  DEF  of 1000 can't defend her against "Magnedragon". Yuma orders "Bull Blader" to attack "Mannequin", dropping Jackal to 1900 and Yuma to 600, the latter via the destroyed monster's effect. Jackal says they can't break their formation and Coyote adds that Wolfsbane will defeat Anna now. Wolfsbane says this the end and begins to order an attack with "Magnedragon". 
 
           Nistro  arrives with " Heroic Challenger - Spartan ".     
 Nistro  storms in on Yuma's lane, saying Yuma isn't looking too good. He orders the " Heroic Challenger - Spartan " he  controls  to attack "Magnet Jammer". Everyone is shocked to see yet another Duelist get involved and Coyote activates the effect of "Jammer",  returning  it to his hand and "Spartan" to Nistro's. Nistro calls that a weak play and tells Yuma he'll take care of Coyote. Yuma thanks him and says he'll surely pay him back later. He changes lanes and says that he'll pay back Anna right now. He orders "Bull Blader" to attack. Wolfsbane asks if he's an idiot - "Bull Blader" has 1600 ATK and "Magnedragon" has 3500. Yuma says he can defeat it - "Bull Blader" has an effect that  negates  the Battle Damage and destroys the opponent's monster. Wolfsbane changes lanes in response. Anna tells Yuma not to do stupid things and asks if he really thought Wolfsbane would have defeated her. Tori says they were just trying to help and Anna asks if they forgot that she helped them first. Yuma thanks her and Anna blushes, saying she didn't want to be praised. Tori asks why she's so happy.
 
           Yuma  uses his allies'  monsters  for an  Xyz Summon .     
 Wolf says they are underestimating the Triad of Terror and that they will break Yuma yet. He says they will negate the effect of "Bull Blader" first and orders "final formation!". Jackal and Coyote both respond with "Roger!" and proceed to draw and Normal Summon " Magnet Chameleon " in Attack Position. Wolf changes to Yuma's lane and explains that as long one "Magnet Chameleon" remains in Attack Position, the effect of the other will negate the effect of "Bull Blader". Nistro asks if they really thought he would let that happen. He draws and Normal Summons " Heroic Challenger - Extra Sword " in Attack Position. Nistro announces that Yuma will not become their prey and orders "Extra Sword" to attack and destroy Coyote's "Magnet Chameleon". Coyote's Life Points fall to 0 and he's ejected from his coaster via parachute. Wolfsbane curses and Anna says Wolfsbane is her target. Nistro changes lanes and appears behind Anna, saying he'll lend a hand here too. Yuma says that even if all three of them are in one lane, only Yuma can attack him since he's closest to him. Astral points out that this lane has three  Level  4 monsters on it. Astral says they should gather their feelings into one and Yuma  overlays  his "Bull Blader" with Anna's "Trolley Olley" and Nistro's "Extra Sword" to  Xyz Summon  " One-Eyed Skill Gainer " in Attack Position.
 
           The effect of " One-Eyed Skill Gainer ".     
 Wolfsbane points out that it has only 2500 ATK - not enough to beat "Magnedragon". Nistro laughs and explains that when "Extra Sword" is used an  Overlay Unit  for a  Warrior - Type   Xyz Monster , that monster gains 1000 ATK. Anna says that "Trolley Olley" can do the same for any Type of monster by 800. The ATK of "Skill Gainer" rises to 4300. Astral tells him to activate its effect and Yuma does so by  detaching  an Overlay Unit. "Skill Gainer" can copy the effect of "Magnedragon". Wolfsbane says that isn't good - he'll lose via  One Turn Kill  if Yuma attacks. Yuma says this is the power of his friends and Jackal changes lanes, appearing between Wolfsbane and Yuma. He says that big brother Wolfsbane won't be defeated as "Skill Gainer" destroys "Magnet Chameleon", dropping Jackal's Life Points to zero and ejecting him from the Duel. Wolfsbane is furious, but peels off by changing lanes. Anna calls him a coward and yells for him to come back. Nistro says its all right - they've won.  
 
           Wolfsbane  and " Electromagnetic Magnedragon " return.     
 Mr. Heartland continues his commentary, saying that it's wonderful - Yuma gathered the power of his friends to defeat the Triad of Terror. The crowd loudly cheers. Wolfsbane curses and smashes the console of his coaster with his fist three times. He says he won't forgive them. Nistro says Anna isn't a real finalist then, as she had just explained that she took another finalist's place. Tori says that's something that  Flip  would do. Anna says it can't be helped and blushes, saying she really wanted to meet Yuma again. Nistro interrupts her as he sees Wolfsbane speeding directly towards them in Yuma's lane. Wolfsbane says he'll take revenge for Coyote and Jackal. Nistro says this doesn't look good and Wolfsbane activates " Direct Magnet ". He explains that by halving both his Life Points and the ATK of "Magnedragon", this card will let it attack directly. His Life Points fall to 2000. Anna leaps from her coaster and lands on the front of Yuma's. She Special Summons " Construction Train Signal Red ", explaining she can do so in Attack Position when a direct attack is declared. It will become the new attack target. "Signal Red" is destroyed and Anna falls from the coaster as her Life Points hit zero. Yuma yells her name, but Anna's cannon deploys itself in flight mode and she lands on it safely. Wolfsbane is furious and says he'll try a real direct attack. He speeds his coaster up in order to ram them but Yuma orders "Skill Gainer" to attack "Magnedragon" with  "Dark Blade" 
 
           The entrance to the next stage of the  Duel Coaster .      Wolfsbane loses and his coaster is dropped down as he flies off in the parachute just before it impacts Yuma's coaster. Anna, flying on her cannon next to them, says that Yuma did it. Yuma thanks her again and Anna says she believes in him and tells him not to lose. They both smile and Anna flies off. Vetrix says he now understands - Yuma's true strength is his friendship and bonds. Heartland says that the Park Section of the Duel Coaster has come to an end. The surviving Duelists will now head into the underground section, "Dragon's Den". Yuma vows to win and yells "kattobingu".

 Yuma 
Yuma  Normal Summons  " Gagaga Caesar " ( 3/1800/600) in Attack Position. "Gagaga Caesar"  attacks  and  destroys  Jackal's " Magnet Saucer " (Jackal: 4000 → 3600 LP). The  effects  of the Coyote's "Magnet Saucer" and " Magnet Eagle Delta "  activate , increasing their  ATK  by 400 as a " Magnet " monster was destroyed ("Magnet Saucer": 1400 → 1800 ATK, "Magnet Eagle Delta": 1200 → 1600 ATK).
 Coyote and Wolfsbane 
 Coyote  moves to Yuma's lane and uses "Magnet Saucer" to attack "Gagaga Caesar", destroying both monsters in a  Double KO . The effect of "Magnet Eagle Delta" activates ("Magnet Eagle Delta": 1600 → 2000 ATK). 
 "Magnet Eagle Delta" attacks directly (Yuma: 3000 → 1000 LP). The effect of "Magnet Eagle Delta" expires ("Magnet Eagle Delta": 2000 → 1200 ATK).
 Kite and Unknown Finalist 
Both players  control  no cards,  Kite  has an unspecified amount of Life Points and the  Unknown Finalist  has 600 Life Points. Kite Normal Summons " Reverse Buster " ( 4/1500/0) in Attack Position. "Reverse Buster" attacks directly (Unknown Finalist: 600 → 0 LP).  18 Duelists Remain .
 Jackal, Coyote and Yuma 
Jackal Normal Summons " Magnet Ape Epsilon " ( 4/1700/500) in Attack Position and Coyote Normal Summons " Magnet Crocodile Zeta " ( 4/1600/1200) in Attack Position. Yuma Normal Summons " Gogogo Golem " ( 4/1800/1500) in  Defense Position . "Magnet Crocodile Zeta" attacks "Gogogo Golem", but the latter is not  destroyed by battle  via its own effect as it's in Defense Position. "Magnet Ape Epsilon" attacks and destroys "Gogogo Golem". "Magnet Eagle Delta" prepares to attack directly, but  Anna  arrives in the same lane as Wolfsbane. She controls " Rocket Arrow Express " ( 10/5000/0) in Attack Position. 
 "Rocket Arrow Express" attacks "Magnet Eagle Delta", but Coyote intercepts by changing lanes, making "Magnet Crocodile Zeta" the new target. "Rocket Arrow Express" then destroys "Magnet Crocodile Zet" (Coyote: 4000 → 600 LP). As a "Magnet" monster was destroyed, the effects of "Magnet Eagle Delta" and "Magnet Ape Epsilon" activate, increasing their ATK by 400 each ("Magnet Ape Epsilon": 1700 → 2100 ATK, "Magnet Eagle Delta": 1200 → 1600 ATK). Due to "Rocket Arrow Express" battling, it destroys itself via its own effect as Anna cannot  pay  its  Maintenance Cost  of  sending  five cards from her  hand  to the  Graveyard . [Notes 1] 
 Coyote vs. Anna & Jackal and Wolfsbane vs. Yuma 
 
                   Electromagnetic Dragon - Magnedragon   " Electromagnetic Magnedragon " is Summoned.     Coyote activates " Magnet Reborn ",  paying  500 Life Points (Coyote: 600 → 100 LP) to revive "Magnet Crocodile Zeta" ( 4/1600/1200) in Attack Position. "Magnet Crocodile Zeta" attacks Anna directly, but she changes lanes to the same one that Wolfsbane is in. Anna  draws  " Lionhearted Locomotive " and subsequently Normal Summons it ( 4/2400/2100) in Attack Position. 
 Wolfsbane activates " Magnet Fusion ",  Tributing  "Magnet Eagle Delta", "Magnet Ape Epsilon" and "Magnet Crocodile Zeta" in order to  Fusion Summon  " Electromagnetic Magnedragon " ( 8/3500/1500) in Attack Position. Yuma draws " Bull Blader " and subsequently Normal Summons it ( 4/1600/1200) in Attack Position. He attempts to change to Anna's lane, but Jackal blocks him by getting into the same lane Yuma is in. Jackal draws " Magnet Mannequin " ( 3/1000/1000) and subsequently Normal Summons it in Attack Position. Coyote draws " Magnet Jammer " and subsequently Normal Summons it ( 4/1200/1600) in Attack Position. "Electromagnetic Magnedragon" attacks and destroys "Lionhearted Locomotive" (Anna: 4000 → 2900 LP). Since "Electromagnetic Magnedragon" destroyed a monster in battle, Wolfsbane activates its effect to inflict  damage  to Anna equal to her destroyed monster's ATK (Anna: 2900 → 500 LP).
 "Bull Blader" attacks and destroys "Magnet Mannequin" (Jackal: 3600 → 3000 LP). Since "Magnet Mannequin" was destroyed in battle, Jackal activates its effect to inflict 200 damage to Yuma (Yuma: 1000 → 800 LP). Jackal activates "Magnet Reborn" (Jackal: 3000 → 2500 LP) to revive "Magnet Mannequin" ( 3/1000/1000) in Attack Position. 
 Coyote vs. Anna and Nistro & Jackal and Wolfsbane vs. Yuma 
Anna draws " Express Train Trolley Olley " and subsequently Normal Summons it ( 4/1800/1000) in Defense Position. "Bull Blader" attacks and destroys "Magnet Mannequin" (Jackal: 2500 → 1900 LP). The effect of "Magnet Mannequin" activates (Yuma: 800 → 600 LP) At this point,  Nistro  arrives at the same lane as Coyote; he controls " Heroic Challenger - Spartan " ( 4/1600/1000) in Attack Position. "Heroic Challenger - Spartan" attacks "Magnet Jammer", but Coyote activates the effect of "Magnet Jammer",  returning  both battling monsters to their  owner 's hands. Yuma changes lanes and uses "Bull Blader" to attack "Electromagnetic Magnedragon" (due to the effect of "Bull Blader", it can negate any Battle Damage from a battle involving it and destroy the monster it battles), but Wolfsbane changes lanes to avoid this. 
 Coyote and Jackal each draw " Magnet Chameleon " and subsequently Normal Summons it ( 2/700/700 each) in Attack Position. Since there are monsters with the same name as "Magnet Chameleon" on the field, one of the Triad of Terror activates the effect of his "Magnet Chameleon" to negate the effect of "Bull Blader". Nistro draws " Heroic Challenger - Extra Sword " and subsequently Normal Summons it ( 4/1000/1000) in Attack Position. "Heroic Challenger - Extra Sword" attacks and destroys Coyote's "Magnet Chameleon" (Coyote: 100 → 0 LP).  17 Duelists Remain . 
 Anna, Nistro and Yuma vs. Jackal and Wolfsbane 
 
                   One-Eyed Skill Gainer   The Summoning of " One-Eyed Skill Gainer ".     Since, at this point of the Duel, Nistro, Anna and Yuma are in the same lane, Yuma  overlay  "Bull Blader" with Anna's "Express Train Trolley Olley" and Nistro's "Heroic Challenger - Extra Sword" in order to  Xyz Summon  " One-Eyed Skill Gainer " ( 4/2500/2600) in Attack Position. Since "Express Train Trolley Olley" is attached to an Xyz Monster as an Overlay Unit, "One-Eyed Skill Gainer" gains 800 ATK ("One-Eyed Skill Gainer": 2500 → 3300 ATK). Since "Heroic Challenger - Extra Sword" is attached to a Warrior-type Xyz Monster as an Overlay Unit, "One-Eyed Skill Gainer" gains 1000 ATK ("One-Eyed Skill Gainer": 3300 → 4300). 
 Yuma activates the effect of "One-Eyed Skill Gainer",  detaching  an  Overlay Unit  ("Skill Gainer" ORU 3 → 2) to target "Electromagnetic Magnedragon" and grant "One-Eyed Skill Gainer" the effect of "Electromagnetic Magnedragon" until the End Phase. "One-Eyed Skill Gainer" attacks "Electromagnetic Magnedragon", but Jackal changes lanes in order to intercept the attack and make "Magnet Chameleon" the new target. "One-Eyed Skill Gainer" then destroys "Magnet Chameleon" (Jackal: 1900 → 0 LP).  16 Duelists Remain . Wolfsbane changes lanes. Wolfbane's hand contains "Direct Magnet", an unknown Trap Card and " Super Polymerization ".
 Anna, Nistro and Yuma vs. Wolfsbane 
Wolfsbane changes lanes back to Yuma's. Wolfsbane activates " Direct Magnet " to halve the ATK of "Electromagnetic Magnedragon" ("Electromagnetic Magnedragon": 3500 → 1750 ATK) and allow it to attack directly by paying half his Life Points (Wolfsbane: 4000 → 2000 LP). "Electromagnetic Magnedragon" attacks Yuma directly, but Anna changes lanes by jumping from her coaster to Yuma's. As "Electromagnetic Magnedragon" has declared a direct attack, Anna activates the effect of " Construction Train Signal Red " to Special Summon it from her hand ( 3/1000/1300) in Attack Position and make it the new attack target. "Electromagnetic Magnedragon" then destroys "Construction Train Signal Red" (Anna: 500 → 0 LP).  15 Duelists Remain .
 "One-Eyed Skill Gainer" attacks and destroys "Electromagnetic Magnedragon" (Wolfsbane: 2000 → 0 LP).  14 Duelists Remain .
 Duel continues in  the next episode .

 Mistakes 
           The card design used at the beginning of the series and the hand mistake.     
           D-Gazer error     
 After Yuma praises Anna for saving him from being defeated, one can see that Anna's D-Gazer has rounded edges instead of the angular shape it normally has. 
 After  Anna  lost her  Life Points , the backs of  Wolfsbane 's cards were shown with the card design used at the beginning of the series and he has more cards in his hand. The card design is corrected in the dub, but the hand mistake was not corrected. 
 
 Notes 
 
 ↑   The written Japanese anime lore of " Rocket Arrow Express " shown in  episode 29  makes no mention of this  effect . 
 
 ↑  2.0   2.1   This card can be seen in his  hand  after the  effects  of  Anna 's and  Nistro 's  Monster Cards  power up  Yuma 's " One-Eyed Skill Gainer ". 
 
 ↑   This card can be seen in Wolfsbane's hand only in the dub.
