 Trivia 
 Color Bottle, the Japanese band who performs this song, declared that while working in the production of the song, they started watching  Yu-Gi-Oh! ZEXAL  and were very interested. The song was made in order to fit the series. 
 This OP theme has one of the highest amount of monsters shown, if not the highest (including those only in card form). 
 At the beginning of the chorus, Yuma is shown  drawing  a card in the form of  ZEXAL  in the  Magma Field   field , although he never  Dueled , nor performed an ZEXAL Morph there. 
 Also, at 1:07, Yuma (in ZEXAL form) and Kite are seen Dueling in the Sphere Field, which also did not happen, as Yuma Dueled Vetrix in the Sphere Field instead.
