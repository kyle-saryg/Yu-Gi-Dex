 Featured Duel: Yuya Sakaki and Declan Akaba vs. Leo Akaba 
 At the start of the  Duel , the  Field Spell Card  " Crossover " is  activated , as per the rules of an  Action Duel . It will allow the players to use  Action Cards , but they may only have one in their  hand  at a time.
 Turn 1: Yuya 
 Yuya   activates  " Stargazer Magician " (   1) and " Timegazer Magician " (   8) in his  Pendulum Zones . Yuya  Pendulum Summons  " Odd-Eyes Pendulum Dragon " (2500/2000) from his  hand  in  Attack Position .
 Turn 2: Declan 
 Declan  activates " D/D Savant Copernicus " (   1) and " D/D Cerberus " (   6) in his Pendulum Zones. Declan Pendulum Summons " D/D Berformet " (1400/1800) and " D/D Ghost " (600/200) from his hand in Attack Position. Declan  Normal Summons  " D/D Necro Slime " (300/300). He then  tunes  the  Level  4 "Berfomet" and the Level 1 "Necro Slime" with the Level 2  Tuner monster  "Ghost" to  Synchro Summon  " D/D/D Gust King Alexander " (2500/2000) in Attack Position. As "Ghost" was  sent  to the  Graveyard , its  effect  lets Declan  target  another " D/D "  monster  in his Graveyard and send a monster with the same name from his Deck to the Graveyard. He chooses "Berfomet". Declan activates the effect of the "Necro Slime" in his Graveyard, letting him  Fusion Summon  using it and other monsters in his Graveyard by  banishing  them. He  fuses  "Ghost" with "Necro Slime" to  Fusion Summon  " D/D/D Flame King Genghis " (2000/1500) in Attack Position. As a "D/D" monster was Normal or Special Summoned, the effect of "Alexander" activates, letting Declan Special Summon a Level 4 or lower "D/D" monster from his Graveyard. He Special Summons "Berfomet" (1400/1800) in Attack Position. As a "D/D" monster was Special Summoned, the effect of "Genghis" activates, letting Declan Special Summon a "D/D" monster from his Graveyard. He Special Summons the second "Berfomet" (1400/1800) in Attack Position. Declan  overlays  his two Level 4 monsters to  Xyz Summon  " D/D/D Wave King Caesar " (2400/1200) in Attack Position. Declan activates the  Continuous Spell Card , " Dark Contract with Exclusivity ", which will prevent him from Special Summoning monsters from the  Extra Deck , but will also prevent his opponent from doing so as long as he  controls  monsters of the same card type. 
 Turn 3: Leo 
 Leo  activates two copies of " Spirit Reactor " (  1) in his Pendulum Zones. He then activates the  Pendulum Effect  of his left "Reactor", letting him change its  Pendulum Scale  to that of another Pendulum Monster on the field. He targets "Timegazer" ("Reactor":    1 → 8). Leo Pendulum Summons " Spirit Tech Force - Pendulum Governor " (2800/2500) and " Spirit Gem - Salamander Core " (0/0) from his hand in Attack Position. Leo activates the effect of "Pendulum Governor", letting him  Tribute  a " Spirit Gem " monster that was Pendulum Summoned from the hand this  turn  that has not activated its effect to allow "Pendulum Governor" to use that card's effect up to twice this turn. He Tributes "Salamander Core". He activates the effect now, letting him  destroy  a monster on the field and inflict  damage  800 to its controller. He destroys "Odd-Eyes" (Yuya: 4000 → 3200) and "Genghis" (Declan: 4000 → 3200). The effect of "Pendulum Governor" prevents any monsters besides Pendulum Monsters from targeting it for attacks. As Leo has cards in both of his Pendulum Zones, its effect also prevents monsters his opponent controls with Levels between those Pendulum Scales" from attacking "Pendulum Governor". Leo  Sets  a card.
 Turn 4: Yuya 
Yuya Pendulum Summons "Odd-Eyes" (2500/2000) from his Extra Deck and " Performapal U Go Golem " (1600/1000) from his hand, both in Attack Position. As it was Pendulum Summoned this turn, Yuya activates the effect of "U Go Golem", letting him Fusion Summon a Fusion Monster from his Extra Deck to using monsters he controls as the Fusion Materials, including "U Go Golem". He fuses "Odd-Eyes" with "U Go Golem" to Fusion Summon " Performapal Gatlinghoul " (2900/900) in Attack Position. As it was Fusion Summoned, its effect activates, inflicting 200 damage to Leo for each card on the field (Leo: 4000 → 1600). As "Gatlinghoul" was Fusion Summoned this turn using a Pendulum Monster as a Material, Yuya activates its other effect, letting him destroy a monster his opponent controls and inflict damage to his opponent equal to that monster's ATK. He targets "Pendulum Governor". 
 Duel continues in the next episode .
