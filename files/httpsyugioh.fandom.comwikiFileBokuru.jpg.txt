 Biography 
 He showed up uninvited at the  World Racing Grand Prix  Premier Event, crashing inside the building and holding up the event with the help of his  Duel Runner . Dobocle appeared because he was angry about how  Turbo Duels  are going to be displayed during the World Racing Grand Prix (in the dub, he attempts extortion, threatening to disrupt the tournament unless he is paid a share of the prize money). Though  Sector Security  tried to arrest him, he easily disposed of them. While he was wreaking havoc and destruction, the  Three Pure Nobles  and  Lazar  were watching. However, Dobocle's rampage was ultimately put an end to by  Akiza Izinski , who Summoned " Black Rose Dragon ", which then used its tail to send Dobocle and his Duel Runner flying and out of the building. Despite Sector Security surrounding him, he still tried to escape, only to be pursued and violently defeated by  Primo  and " Meklord Emperor Wisel ". His  Duel Runner  was completely destroyed in the onslaught. [1] 
 He survived though, and later Dueled  Crow Hogan  after the latter became a member of Security. [2]
