 History 
         ZEXAL III up close     
 ZEXAL III was created by the bonds between  Yuma  and  Astral  growing stronger, because of Yuma's happiness with reuniting with his partner during their Duel against  Mr. Heartland . Similar to the previous forms of ZEXAL, Yuma and Astral use ZEXAL Morph to combine into one being; as they do so they are cloaked by an aura: Yuma with red mist and Astral with blue mist. [1]

 This new form is similar in appearance to " Number 39: Utopia ", including the golden armor and silvery wings. His hair becomes more defined and luminous with hetero-chromatic gold and orange eyes. Their  D-Pad  is also gold colored and shaped like an X. 
 
                   Line Art of ZEXAL III     
 With the new ZEXAL form, Yuma and Astral were able to perform the  Shining Draw , creating " ZS - Vanish Sage ". They used its "ZEXAL Field" ability to counter Heartland's Barian Field. Yuma then used the effect of "Vanish Sage" in conjunction with the banishing effect of " Galaxy-Eyes Photon Dragon " to banish all of Heartland's " Infection Bug Tokens ". They then used "Galaxy-Eyes" to attack directly and win the Duel, defeating him and disbanding the  Fearsome Four of the Dark Dueling World . [1] 
 During the final Duel against  Don Thousand , Yuma and Astral utilized this form in a final effort to defeat the Barian deity. [2] 
 Yuma and Astral would later use this form one more time during their final rematch against  Nash . [3] [4] 
 The previous forms of ZEXAL are still accessible. During the penultimate Duel against Don Thousand, all three forms were utilized in succession. [2] 
 
 Trivia 
 The card " Creator of Miracles " is a reference to ZEXAL III.
