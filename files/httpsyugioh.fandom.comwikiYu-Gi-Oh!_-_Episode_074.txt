 Summary 
 The episode opens a Duel between two unknown characters. A driver trying to make his way through the crowd honks and complains. A  police officer  explains the tournament and asks the motorist to move.
 Meanwhile,  Kaiba ,  Yugi , and  Mokuba  are flying in Kaiba's helicopter, having located the  Rare Hunters  that have captured  Téa  and  Joey . Kaiba asks Yugi about  Marik , but Yugi admits to knowing little about him, other than the fact that he has a  Millennium Item . Kaiba brushes off Yugi's "bogus" magic talk. Yugi admonishes him, reminding Kaiba of his first-hand experience with  Pegasus '  Millennium Eye .
 Kaiba ignores Yugi, who insists his  Millennium Puzzle 's powers are real. He reveals his true identity as an ancient pharaoh, much to Kaiba and Mokuba's surprise. Kaiba denies this, but recalls what  Ishizu  told him at the  Domino Museum  about his ancient past. He and Yugi argue about Ishizu's revelations and Marik's motivation, but come to no resolution.
 Yugi reveals the power of  Millennium Rod  and expresses his concern for his friends, reiterating the need to find them soon. Kaiba tells Yugi he is tired of hearing about his friends, especially Joey. Yugi defends Joey and his dueling capacity, speculating that Joey may have even qualified for the  Battle City Finals  already.
 The helicopter approaches the Rare Hunters' hideout and Kaiba orders the helicopter to land.
 
 Differences in adaptations 
 The flashback to Yugi defeating the Rare Hunter runs differently between versions - in the Japanese version, it simply shows Yugi using "Chain Destruction" to destroy the Rare Hunter's copies of "Exodia The Forbidden One", followed up by Marik possessing him. In the English version, the last two turns of the duel are recapped (starting from the Rare Hunter summoning Exodia's head) before showing Marik possessing him. 
 Cut from the English dub is a small scene before the midway commercial break where Yugi explains to Kaiba and Mokuba that Marik's true objective, aside from obtaining the three God Cards, is to kill the Pharaoh's soul.
