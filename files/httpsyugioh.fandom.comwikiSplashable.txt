Splashable  refers to cards capable of boosting almost any Decks they are placed in. For a card to be splashable, it must function well in a Deck regardless of what other cards are in that Deck. 
 A card that is considered splashable generally does not apply to any specific  Type ,  Attribute ,  archetype , or other factor that applies to only a specific group of cards. For example, " Limiter Removal " is not splashable as it is only useful in a Deck that uses mostly Machine monsters, but " Shrink " is splashable because it can be played independently of other cards in the Deck. 
 One example of a splashable card is " Dark Hole ". Many splashable cards are considered  staples . However, cards like " Giant Trunade " have since evolved from staple to  broken .
 Battle Packs  contains mostly splashable cards, as they are specifically created for  Sealed Pack Play .
