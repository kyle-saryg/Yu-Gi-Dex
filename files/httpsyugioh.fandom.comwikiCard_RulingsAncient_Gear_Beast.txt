 Previously Official Rulings 
   These TCG rulings were issued by  Upper Deck Entertainment  and have since been deemed unofficial by Konami. [2]  They were previously considered official and can still be correct, as long as they follow the official gameplay rules, or unless Konami has issued a ruling that says otherwise. References:  [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] 
 
 “Your opponent’s  Effect Monster ” means the  monster  that your opponent  controls  when this effect is  activated .  [ sic ] 
 If “ Ancient Gear Beast ”  attacks , the effects of  Spell  or  Trap Cards  that are already  face-up  can still have their effects  activated , like “ Ultimate Offering ”, “ Royal Oppression ”, or “ Skull Lair ”. However,  face-down   Spell  or  Trap Cards  cannot be  activated  ( flipped   face-up ), including a  face-down  “ Ultimate Offering ”, etc. 
 The effect of “ Ancient Gear Beast ” that prevents your opponent from  activating   Spell  or  Trap Cards  is a  Continuous Effect . It cannot be  chained  to. “ Divine Wrath ” cannot be  activated  against it. 
 If “ Ancient Gear Beast ”  attacks , and is  destroyed  before the end of the  Damage Step , its effect is no longer applied after it is  destroyed , even if it is still on the  field  and has not yet been sent to the  Graveyard . (A  Continuous Effect  is no longer applied after the  monster  generating it has been  destroyed , even if the  monster  is still on the  field .) The effect of “ Ancient Gear Beast ” is applied up until the point it is  destroyed , though.
