 Summary 
 Duel Academy 's students arrive at  Domino City  for their field trip.  Jaden Yuki ,  Syrus Truesdale  and  Tyranno Hassleberry  purchase guidebooks to visit the city's landmarks. They visit the  pier  where  Yugi Muto  Dueled  Joey Wheeler , while the latter was controlled by  Marik Ishtar 's  Millennium Rod . They later arrive at  Solomon Muto 's  Kame Game  shop. They introduce themselves to Solomon, and upon explaining that they are from Duel Academy, he allows them to come inside, explaining that Yugi  is probably off on another journey (in the dub, he says that Yugi "went to the market to get some olives three years ago"). He offers to be their tour guide for the rest of the day, and he takes them to the sites where Yugi Dueled  Seeker  and  Strings . He lags behind as they continue to their next destination, and is kidnapped. They split up to search for him, and run into  Chazz Princeton . He tells Syrus and Hassleberry that they are to meet the kidnappers on the roof of a building - the same building on which Yugi and  Seto Kaiba  once Dueled  Umbra  and  Lumis .
 They do so, and are met by the kidnappers -  Frost  and  Thunder  of  The Light Brigade . They are to  Tag Duel  them. Frost plays " Side Attack ", which essentially changes the format of the Tag Duel to that of two single Duels - Syrus and Thunder may not attack Hassleberry and Frost, and vice-versa. Frost and Thunder Summon " Ice Knight " and " Thunder Knight ", respectively, and  Tribute  them to Summon the " Monarch " monsters of the same  Attribute  - " Mobius the Frost Monarch " and " Zaborg the Thunder Monarch ". They also play a combination of " Reflector Bit " monsters, which lets them reflect damage to their opponents. Hassleberry is reduced to 1100  Life Points  before Syrus' second turn comes.
 
 Featured Duel: Frost and Thunder vs. Tyranno Hassleberry and Syrus Truesdale 
 Turn 1: Frost 
Frost draws. He then  activates  " Side Attack " and selects Hassleberry. Now Hassleberry and Frost can't attack Syrus and Thunder or any monsters that they control. Also Syrus and Thunder can't attack Hassleberry and Frost or any monsters that they control. If a player has no monsters, their opponents can attack that player directly. Frost then  Normal Summons  " Ice Knight " (1300/1200) in  Attack Position . Due to the effect of "Ice Knight", it gains 400 ATK for each  Aqua - Type   monster  on the field. There is currently one ("Ice Knight": 1300 → 1700/1200).
 Turn 2: Tyranno Hassleberry 
Hassleberry draws. He then  Special Summons  " Gilasaurus " (1400/400) via its own effect in Attack Position. Hassleberry then  Tributes  "Gilasaurus" in order to  Tribute Summon  " Dark Driceratops " (2400/1500) in Attack Position. Hassleberry then activates " Jurassic World ". Now all Dinosaur-Type monsters gain 300 ATK and DEF ("Dark Driceratops": 2400 → 2700/1500 → 1800). Hassleberry then  Sets  a card.
 Turn 3: Thunder 
Thunder draws " Thunder Knight " and subsequently Normal Summons it (1300/1200) in Attack Position. Due to the effect of "Thunder Knight", it gains 400 ATK for each  Thunder -Type monster on the field. There is currently one ("Thunder Knight": 1300 → 1700/1200). Thunder then Sets a card.
 Turn 4: Syrus Truesdale 
Syrus draws. He then Normal Summons " Truckroid " (1000/2000) in  Defense Position .
 Turn 5: Frost 
Frost draws. He then Tributes "Ice Knight" in order to Tribute Summon " Mobius the Frost Monarch " (2400/1000) in Attack Position. Since "Mobius the Frost Monarch" was Tribute Summoned, its effect activates, allowing Frost to  destroy  "Jurassic World" and Hassleberry's Set card ("Dark Driceratops": 2700 → 2400/1800 → 1500). Frost then activates " Mobius Castle ". Now the ATK and DEF of all Dinosaur,  Winged Beast ,  Plant ,  Beast  and  Beast-Warrior -Type monsters on Hassleberry's side of the field will decrease by 500 ("Dark Driceratops": 2400 → 1900/1500 → 1000). If Frost doesn't control "Mobius the Frost Monarch" on his side of the field, "Mobius Castle" will be destroyed. "Mobius the Frost Monarch" attacks and destroys "Dark Driceratops" (Hassleberry 4000 → 3500). Frost then Sets two cards.
 Turn 6: Tyranno Hassleberry 
Hassleberry draws " Pot of Greed " and subsequently activates it to  draw  two cards. Hassleberry then activates " Earthquake " to switch all monsters on the field to Defense Position; "Mobius the Frost Monarch" and "Thunder Knight" are switched to Defense Position. Hassleberry then Normal Summons " Archeonys " (300 → 0/1300 → 800) in Attack Position. He then activates " New Ultra Evolution " to Tribute "Archeonys" to Special Summon " Dark Tyranno " (2600 → 2100/1800 → 1300) in Attack Position. 
 "Dark Tyranno" attacks Frost directly via its own effect, but Frost activates his face-down " Bit Shoot " to Special Summon  Reflector Bit " (0/0) from his hand in Attack Position. A replay then occurs and Hassleberry uses "Dark Tyranno" to attack "Reflector Bit". Due to the effect of "Reflector Bit", it is not destroyed and the  Battle Damage  that Frost would take is redirected to Thunder instead. Thunder then activates his face-down "Bit Shoot" to Special Summon a "Reflector Bit" of his own (0/0) from his hand in Attack Position. Due to the effect of Thunder's "Reflector Bit", the redirected Battle Damage that Thunder takes is nullified and Syrus takes 500 damage (Syrus 4000 → 3500).
 Turn 7: Thunder 
Thunder draws. He then Tributes "Thunder Knight" in order to Tribute Summon " Zaborg the Thunder Monarch " (2400/1000) in Attack Position. Since "Zaborg the Thunder Monarch" was Tribute Summoned, its effect activates, allowing Thunder to destroy "Truckroid". "Zaborg the Thunder Monarch" attacks Syrus directly, but Frost activates his face-down " Revolving Stage ". Now when an opponent takes Battle Damage, Frost can redirect the damage to another opponent. Frost uses the effect of "Revolving Stage" to redirect the Battle Damage Syrus would take to Hassleberry instead (Hassleberry 3500 → 1100).
 Duel concludes in  the next episode .
 
 Differences in adaptations 
 In the dub, the guidebook that Hassleberry reads from incorrectly states that  Pegasus  handcuffed  Yugi  and  Joey  for their Duel at  Domino Pier . Syrus corrects him on this. This is not present in the Japanese version, as both had the  same  guidebook, which was said to have been written by  Solomon Muto . 
 Solomon's own depiction in the English version was of a senile old man, while in the Japanese version, he appeared just as he did in  the previous series . 
 In the dub, when Hassleberry and Syrus are talking about the Duel between Yugi and Joey at the pier, Syrus breaks the fourth wall and says he is "up to date on his Yu-Gi-Oh! history". 
 The dub cuts out Kenzan telling Sho that he let the latter win their duel when the two are arguing while searching for Sugoroku.
