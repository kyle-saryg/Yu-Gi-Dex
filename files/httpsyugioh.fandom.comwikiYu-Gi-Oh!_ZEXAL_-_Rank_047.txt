 The Four Powers!! 
 
 "The Deity of Despair!!"  is the forty-seventh chapter of the  Yu-Gi-Oh! ZEXAL  manga .
 This chapter was first printed in Japanese in the 12/2014 issue of  V Jump , released on October 21, 2014, and in English in the 10/27/2014 issue of  Weekly Shonen Jump .
 E'Rah  has unveiled herself revealing her plan to  Yuma ,  Astral ,  Shark ,  Kaito  and the others, as well as the role she played in each of their lives. The  Duel  continues with E'Rah taking  Kyoji's  place, using the shadows of her enemies'  monsters  against them.
 
 Summary 
 Shark  and  Kaito  look on in shock as Kaito asks what that it. The huge woman introduces herself as  E'Rah , the deity of despair who will extinguish their light of hope. As  Yuma  repeats the phrase, the area below them is erased, revealing a massive graveyard. E'Rah explains that this is where hope ends as  Kotori ,  Cologne  and  Tetsuo  gasp in shock.  Takashi  asks if it is a graveyard, and  Cathy  asks why they're in such a creepy place. Yuma asks Astral if he knows who E'Rah is, and Astral explains that the return of Kaito's " Number " brought back most of his memories. She is E'Rah, and he came from the  Astral World  to defeat her. Shark is surprised to learn that E'Rah is why Astral is here, and Kaito asks what E'Rah is. Astral explains that E'Rah is the shadow that hope produces; wherever there is light, there is also shadow, which is the fate of all worlds, and E'Rah is the deity of destruction. "Shadow?" Yuma asks. Astral explains that the Astral World is a kind of light; born from human hopes and ideals in order to raise the people above the chaos of reality. However, the light of that hope attracts E'Rah; whenever a new hope is born, she picks up its scent and crosses dimensions to reach it. Shark is disturbed by the comparison to an otherworldly shark. 
 Yuma realizes what the graves are, and E'Rah licks her lips, explaining that each grave marker is a hope that she has destroyed. The shadow cast by the light of their hope gives her power, and the stronger the light, the deeper the darkness. She has manipulated their fates to amplify her power, catching Kaito's attention. E'Rah declares that they Astral World is the ultimate prey, as is  Earth , which creates it. So she has decided to destroy both of their worlds. She laid several curses on them, and one of them was  Haruto . Kaito is horrified to realize that E'Rah caused Haruto's condition, and  Luna  realizes the implications of that confession. E'Rah clarifies that  Dr. Faker 's heart broke, so he opened the door to another world, and that increased her strength. 
 Kaito is furious, but E'Rah pays him no attention, and she explains that when Yuma's father,  Kazuma Tsukumo  opened the door to the Astral World, she sensed something unexpected; that the Astral World were sending a messenger to confront her, and that messenger was Astral. Astral realizes that E'Rah was the one who scattered his memories, and E'Rah confirms it; she scattered his memories and used them. Then she discovered  Kyoji Yagumo , writhing in agony as he sought salvation for his soul; the perfect vessel for E'Rah. Shark realizes that E'Rah is the one who broke Yagumo, and  E'Rah laughs, commenting that the darkness that Yagumo sought increased her power, warning them that nothing has ever escaped her destruction. Yuma snaps that E'Rah won't get away with this; he doesn't understand complicated stuff, but he does know one thing. A lot of people are in pain because of E'Rah, like Kaito and Shark; E'Rah hurt them and he'll never forgive her. Kaito thinks of Haruto and his father, and with 2000  LP , he warns E'Rah that she won't leave alive. Shark, with 2800 LP, adds that the match isn't over; he'll give her a hundred times the despair that she caused Yagumo. With Yagumo's 100 LP, E'Rah's substance cloaks Yagumo, and she declares that they will continue the slide of their destinies towards despair. Yuma  Sets  a card, ending his turn, standing with 1 LP and the 5000  ATK  " No. S39: Utopia the Lightning ".
 E'Rah declares her turn, materializing the eighth card in her hand freely. She activates a  Continuous Spell Card , " Sea of Rebirth ", and  Tokunosuke  observes the spell freezing over part of the  Ocean of Otherworlds . E'Rah explains that when her opponent  Special Summons  monsters, she can Special Summon the same number of monsters from her Deck. Then she activates the  Spell Card  " Non-equivalent Exchange ", Special Summoning two monsters from her opponent's  Graveyard  to their field. She Special Summons " Bahamut Shark " and " Galaxy-Eyes Photon Dragon ". Shark and Kaito are shocked that E'Rah resurrected their  ace monsters , but Astral notes that E'Rah has met the conditions for activating the effect of "Sea of Rebirth". E'Rah agrees, nothing that Astral seems antiquated with her methods, and thus he must know that light is fragile and fleeting; darkness is always the victor. Astral retorts that light may be weak, but it holds power even she doesn't know, and in his companions, he has a strength that supports that power. 
 E'Rah notes that she sees, but even together they still cannot touch her. She uses the effect of "Sea of Rebirth" to Special Summon two " Strain Spores ", and Yuma observes their 0 ATK. Next she activates another Continuous Spell Card, " Sky of Endless Night ", which allows her to attach her monsters to  Xyz Monsters  as  Overlay Units  when they are destroyed. Then she activates the Spell Card " Bizarre Sacrifice ", destroying all monsters she controls. Yuma is surprised that E'Rah destroyed her own monsters. E'Rah then activates the effect of "Sky of Endless Night", attaching the destroyed "Strain Spores" to "Bahamut Shark" and "Utopia the Lightning". This activates the effects of the attached "Strain Spores", Special Summoning the " E'Rah Monsters " of the monsters that they are attached to. Darker versions of "Bahamut Shark" and "Utopia the Lightning"; "Bahamut Shark E'Rah" and "Utopia the Lightning E'Rah"; appear, with 100 more ATK than the originals. Next she activates the  Equip Spell Card  " Strain Element ", Special Summoning the equipped monster's "E'Rah Monster" with 500 more ATK. She equips it to "Galaxy-Eyes", Special Summoning "Galaxy-Eyes Photon Dragon E'Rah". E'Rah explains that these are the shadows that they created, and she activates the Continuous Spell Card, " Shifting Land ". As she controls monsters, her LP become equal to their total ATK; 11300.
 Yuma realizes that they can't deplete her LP without destroying her monsters, but they have higher ATK than their own. E'Rah reminds Yuma that she told him that shadow always vanquishes light, emerging from it, and whichever survives becomes the truth. She attacks "Utopia the Lightning" with "Utopia the Lightning E'Rah". Sharkand Kaito realize in shock that the attack will defeat Yuma, who only has 1 LP left. Astral tells Yuma to activate his  Trap Card , and Yuma activates " Shield of Bones ", negating the attack and ending the  Battle Phase , but negating the effects of all monsters he controls and reducing their ATK to zero. E'Rah comments in amusement that they cast away their strength to save their life, but now they have nothing of value left on their field. Light and shadow have switched places, and she Sets a card to end her turn. Yuma yelps that E'Rah is a lot more powerful than they are, and he wonders how they are supposed to defeat her as Astral grits his teeth.
 And then a voice tells Yuma not to give up, as Kazuma Tsukumo materializes out of light.

She then activates " Non-equivalent Exchange ", Special Summoning " Bahamut Shark " (2600/2100) and " Galaxy-Eyes Photon Dragon " (3000/2500) from her opponents'  Graveyard  to their side of the  field . The  effect  of "Sea of Rebirth" activates, Special Summoning 2 " Strain Spores " (0/???) to E'Rah's side of the field. Next, she activates the Continuous Spell Card " Sky of Endless Night ". As long as it is  face-up  in E'Rah's  Spell and Trap Card Zone , if a monster she  controls  is  destroyed , it be  attached  to an  Xyz Monster  on the field as an  Xyz Material . She then precedes to activate " Bizarre Sacrifice ", destroying all monsters she controls. This activates the effect of "Sky of Endless Night", attaching a copy of "Strain Spore" as Xyz Material to both "Bahamut Shark" (0 → 1) and " No. S39: Utopia the Lightning " (1 → 2).
