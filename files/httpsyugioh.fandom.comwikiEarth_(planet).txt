One alternate Earth resides for each method of Summoning introduced except the  Pendulum Summon , and the Duelists who survive on those alternate Earths utilize the Summoning method associated with their dimensions.

 Etymology 
 The modern English noun earth developed from Middle English erthe personified as a goddess in Germanic paganism (appearing as Jörð in Norse mythology, mother of the god Thor). In general English usage, the name earth can be capitalized or spelled in lowercase interchangeably, either when used absolutely or prefixed with "the" (i.e. "Earth", "the Earth", "earth", or "the earth"). Many deliberately spell the name of the planet with a capital, both as "Earth" or "the Earth".

 History 
 Formation 
       Everything was created from darkness.     
 The  Numeron Dragon  who was the first being to have existed, used it's power to create the universe, however this took all the power it had, nearly killing it. With it's remaining power, the dragon shed a single tear which contained all of its emotions and knowledge. When the universe began it split into darkness and light. [1]  As the light vanished soon, the darkness would fill the universe and create everything in the world, including life. [1] [2] 
 The tear the Dragon shed took the form of a  card , the front represented the Earth also designated as the Human World and the  Duel Monsters Spirit World , while the darkness was the  World of Darkness . [3]  Eventually, the stars and planets were born, including the Earth, where the humans stood at the top of all creations. [3]  The card eventually impacted on the Earth, resulting in the Moon being formed. Inevitably, the humans discovered the  Duel Monsters , therefore, it became a touchstone to test their souls. [3] 
 
 Early civilization 
 10,000 years before the start of the series, a perfect city known as  Atlantis  existed isolating it from the rest of the world. It was inhabited by  Duel Monster Spirits  and humans, who coexisted peacefully. They were said to have known nothing of violence. Soon after a monarch  Dartz  came to power, he tried to destroy the earth with an army of  Orichalcos Soldiers , but his father,  Ironheart , opposed him. He went to a temple and requested the assistance of the Duel Monster Spirits, which they agreed to lend. After a battle known as the Battle of the Stone Wasteland,  The Great Leviathan  was defeated and sealed away by Ironheart's army. Before his death, Ironheart sealed the doors to the Duel Monsters Spirit World, leaving behind their spirits scattered across all the world. Some were left in the Egyptian pyramids, the Greek temples, the Aztec pyramids, the Egyptian mastabas. Dartz survived, and began gathering souls to revive The Great Leviathan to destroy and reconstruct both the Earth and the Duel Monsters Spirit World in his own image.
 Around the same era, the first  Nazca battle  took place, when the  Crimson Dragon  and five of its dragon servants all fought the Crimson Devil,  Red Nova . The  Legendary Signer  assisted in the Dragons fight, with the power of the full   Dragon Mark , the signer preformed the Blazing Soul technique to defeat Red Nova and sealing it within the Earth in the form of the serpent Nazca Line.
 Around 5000 years prior in ancient Peru, lived an Inca civilization known as the  People of the Stars ' led by the  Star Dragon King  who worshiped the  Dragon Star  at the  Sky Temple  on the Andes Mountains. Around this time and place, a secret society known as Iliaster was believed to have been form and would manipulate the events of history in the coming centuries, however it's later stated that the organization was founded by a man from an apocalyptic future with the objective of rewriting history for the better. When the second  Nazca battle  took place, the people prayed to their deity for salvation against the threat of the Earthbound Immortals, the Dragon Star responded by appearing in the form of the Crimson Dragon and fought the Immortals along with it's servants and succeeded in sealing them into the Earth as more Nazca Lines.
 
 Ancient Egypt 
 3,000 years (5,000 in the English version) prior in ancient Egypt, Egyptians used stone tablets to seal Duel Monster Spirits and summon them to fight battles. [4] [5]  The Egyptians harnessed the power of the  Duel Spirits  for use in their  Shadow Games . It is implied that Duel Spirits were the basis for the Egyptian concepts of  ka  and  ba . When the dark magic of the shadows threat to destroy humanity and the earth,  Pharaoh Atem  using a spell which included his name and sealed  Zorc  in the  Millennium Pendant . He gave throne of Egypt to  Priest Seto , then sealed his soul within the  Millennium Pendant , erasing his own memories to keep the spell from ever being used to resurrect Zorc. The puzzle was then destroyed, scattered into dozens of pieces, making it known as the Millennium Puzzle
 
 Yu-Gi-Oh! 
 3000 years later in the present age, a young boy named  Yugi Muto  solves the Millennium Puzzle and is possessed by the spirit of the  Nameless Pharaoh , who lost all of his memories from his old life. As a thank you to the spirit who saved him from bullies and gave him new friends, Yugi decided to help the spirit out and find a way to recover his lost memories and send him to the after life.
