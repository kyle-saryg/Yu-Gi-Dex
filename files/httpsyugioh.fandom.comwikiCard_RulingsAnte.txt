 Previously Official Rulings 
   These TCG rulings were issued by  Upper Deck Entertainment  and have since been deemed unofficial by Konami. [1]  They were previously considered official and can still be correct, as long as they follow the official gameplay rules, or unless Konami has issued a ruling that says otherwise. References:  [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] 
 
 If " Ante " is the only card in your  hand , you cannot activate it. 
 If your opponent has no cards in his  hand , you cannot activate " Ante ". 
 You  select  cards at the resolution of " Ante "'s effect, not at " Ante "'s activation. 
 You cannot  chain  " Barrel Behind the Door " to " Ante " because you don't know for certain whether you will take damage. 
 If either player chains " Raigeki Break " or " Last Turn " to " Ante " and then has no cards at resolution of " Ante "'s effect, " Ante "'s effect disappears. 
 When " A Legendary Ocean " is active and you activate " Ante ", when you check the  Level , treat the  Levels  of  WATER  monsters in the  hand  as 1 lower for purposes of " Ante ". 
 Mentions in Other Rulings 
 Barrel Behind the Door : You cannot activate " Barrel Behind the Door " against effects if you don't know for certain that they will  inflict  damage when the  effect  is activated. So you cannot  activate  it against..." Ante "...
