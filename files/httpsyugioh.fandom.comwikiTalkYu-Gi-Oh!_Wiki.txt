 Listing of "upgraded monsters"? 
 By "upgraded monsters" I mean stuff like  Nobleman-Eater Bug   Hade-Hane  and arguably  Needle Burrower .
 I'd make it myself but I don't really know a thing about how pages should look and stuff.  Mattwo  ( talk  •  contribs ) 15:31, January 27, 2012 (UTC)
 
 There are already an article that base on "retraining" version, so don't bother create one. It's like " Celtic Guardian " to " Obnoxious Celtic Guard ". -- F r e d C a t  15:38, January 27, 2012 (UTC) 
 Retrained is when the card keeps it ATK, DEF, Level and has the same monster in the illustration, but is given an effect. The "upgraded" cards Mattwo is referring to aren't retrained. There's an article  card evolutions  which covers both upgrades and retrained versions. --  Deltaneos  ( talk ) 17:16, January 27, 2012 (UTC)
 That's what I was such to saying... just forgot for a minute, but yea. -- F r e d C a t  17:23, January 27, 2012 (UTC) 
 Possessed Dark Soul Featured Card 
 I was just wondering about featuring the card "Possessed Dark Soul" as I use it often and find it quite powerful for stealing tuners, and Xyz monsters. It is one of my favorite cards, and people use a lot more smaller monsters now than back in the day before Synchros. 
 Tyrantglider  ( talk  •  contribs ) 18:31, February 21, 2012 (UTC)Tyrantglider
 Xyz Monsters are levelless, not level 0 as I originally thought. Possessed Dark soul is still powerful for stealing tuners, marshmallons, etc.  Tyrantglider  ( talk  •  contribs ) 13:31, March 19, 2012 (UTC) Tyrantglider

 Yeah, it's down. There have been a lot of problems like this with chat recently. If you wait a while and try rejoining it might work. Chat is being  re-engineered this month . Hopefully when that's done, the problems will be fixed. --  Deltaneos  ( talk ) 20:08, February 21, 2012 (UTC)

 need a new content... 
 hi there, since this wikia has reached more than 50 000 pages, how about adding some content such as featured articles, featured images and did you know...? trivia??-- Nur Fadzila  ( talk  •  contribs ) 02:34, February 28, 2012 (UTC)
 hmm,I guess my early post above wasn't a good idea at all since YGO is all about cards XD but hey, how about featured character?? where we'll feature a character from any YGO series...ok like this, we'll feature a character once per month where we'll held a poll where any users here can nominate their fav characters...the character with most votes will be featured on the next month, btw Duel Monsters Spirit also acceptable..:)-- Nur Fadzila  ( talk  •  contribs ) 08:09, June 6, 2012 (UTC)

 Priority Update Notice 
 The main page should have some kind of reference or notice about the priority change. It literally just changed the entire game. Perhaps a big notice across the top with a link to the article?
 
 Main Page lock? 
 It's been bugging me that the Main Page has very little protection from trollers/vandals. All you need to do is to sign up for an account, and you can compromise it as much as you can.
 Do you think we could put an added layer of security on it, maybe so that only admins can edit it? That's what I've seen some other Wikis do.  Blatch  ( talk  •  contribs ) 03:01, April 28, 2012 (UTC)
 Also, woo. 1000th main-page post.
 
 It's not that simple. Your account needs to be autoconfirmed before it can edit the Main Page. The common way of becoming autoconfirmed is for your account to be at least four days old and have at least ten edits. --  Deltaneos  ( talk ) 11:27, April 28, 2012 (UTC)

 You don't need to  vandalise the Main Page  to test that theory. >_> The fact that you can click "Edit", rather than "View source" should be enough to tell you can edit it. --  Deltaneos  ( talk ) 22:32, April 30, 2012 (UTC)

 New File System 
 I don't know if anyone already talked about this, sorry if anyone did. So, to be direct, I didn't like very much the new system of seeing files (when you click on a file to see its details and etc.). First, if the file is not loose in an article, how can I upload a new version of the file? And how can I see the story? And edit it?

 Someone idiot block me from ANY wiki from cause is 'vandalism'. I can only wach when my bstrd lttl brother stops me at any wiki! He makes tons of spam and other non-good and now i cant be in ANY wiki! I found this yugioh wiki. Thank good, he (brother) didnt found this wiki. So, WHAT HECK I CAN DO IF I AM BLOCKED FOR YEAR 2025?! <--- biggest block time.
 I read i can try  speak (chat) with someone, but i can cause i'm blocked. 
 sites:
 Pac-man world wiki
 Littlebigplanet 1 and 2 wiki

 bakugan wiki

 so what i must do? i only make sites better, by making new information.
 love, PCpacherOffOn. 
 ps. name is unknow, it are deleted forever. Fault is virus (?) that i get from (?) yugioh! custom wiki. Pc that is write that is my friend computer, cause that virus (?) hack it. And cant make new accounts.
 And questions;
 
 Who is boss of this wiki? 
 Why same informations are here and nobody fix them? (featured card etc) 
 Why when someone makes page better, someone delete it cause 'wrong format' and make new version of it, instead of rewriting? 
 Featured Card 
 Is there any reason that the featured card has been the same for months? Are the features written on a volunteer basis, and no-one has volunteered? Would it be possible to change this, maybe, once a month? Or at least to implement some sort of rotation so it does not become stagnant? Answers are much appreciated. If it is on a volunteer basis, then can I volunteer to write a feature?

 Videos 
 Why is it that there have only been 25 videos added to this wikia since the Video section was added not long ago? I'm tired of seeing the same anime commercials in that section, and I was wondering if there was any certain way I could help out.
 Are there any kinds of videos that would be wanted here?  Blatch  ( talk  •  contribs ) 22:18, July 15, 2012 (UTC)
 
 Removing the module outright is the best option in my opinion. I've only seen it used by someone to get free advertising for their YouTube videos and other people to add unimportant or unrelated stuff. We don't use much videos on this site and when we do we can just put them directly on the relevant articles. --  Deltaneos  ( talk ) 22:33, July 15, 2012 (UTC) 
 Anime videos are not needed. They're all dubbed anime. We use the Japanese version events in our articles, so dubbed videos do not help us. If Wikia will let us remove the module, I say go for it.  Cheesedude  ( talk  •  contribs ) 00:17, July 16, 2012 (UTC) 
 The video upload option being above the image upload option is something I've complained about a few times before, so add me to the list of people who wants it gone. And we all know Fredcat's stance on the recent additions to the site... -- Golden Key  ( talk  •  contribs ) 00:22, July 16, 2012 (UTC) 
 The guys of Narutopedia disabled this feature completely. -- The Goblin  01:37, July 16, 2012 (UTC)

 No article for episode 221 
 It seems you have an article for every episode of Yu-Gi-Oh but you're missing the article for episode 221. I just thought I should let you know this.  —This unsigned comment was made by  Theinvadersonic  ( talk  •  contribs ) 13:15, 25 July 2012‎ (UTC)

 Mm... 
 I know that Zexal II anime has been announed, but why is it included in the template? Viewers should know of newer episodes of Zexal (I) first (same goes for the spin-off D Team manga, it should be first the Zexal manga).  E n e r g y   X   ∞  17:25, September 8, 2012 (UTC)

 Are you planning on changing character number 6 for  ZEXAL . People have changed it quite a bit recently between Hart, Rio and Rie. It might be worth starting a discussion to see if we can agree on one to stick with. --  Deltaneos  ( talk ) 18:24, October 20, 2012 (UTC) 
 Hart has had more actual involvement, but I'd hardly call  any  of the three of them main characters at all. There really  isn't  another character to use. Yuma and Astral are the main character, while Kite and Shark have been featured prominently enough in the plot to be considered main. Kotori is a main character only because she's  always  there. The rest of Yuma's friends do pretty much nothing. I would consider most of the  villains  to be better fits for "main characters" than Yuma's friends. 
 Rio and Rei were both featured in V Jump, and the article made it quite clear they'd be involved in the plot. But they haven't been yet.  Cheesedude  ( talk  •  contribs ) 18:54, October 20, 2012 (UTC) 
 What if we had just five characters for that section?

 I haven't checked other browsers, but the bottom two should be centre aligned. I think it looks okay, but my biggest worry is that if we get lenient on the six rule, people will start adding/removing more characters, until each section is totally off balance. --  Deltaneos  ( talk ) 02:30, October 21, 2012 (UTC) 
 I was thinking earlier about the possibility of having one of the portals either rotate or randomize between the disputed characters; I've never done anything with randomization in wikitext myself, but Wikipedia has templates that do pseudorandom shuffling, and IIRC there's a random selection extension used on e.g. Uncyclopedia (though it's been far too long since I've looked at either to say offhand how they work).  「 ディノ 奴 千？！ 」 ?  ·  ☎ Dinoguy1000  04:41, October 21, 2012 (UTC) 
 A character doesn't need to be connected to the plot to be part of the 6. Deltaneos said it  here . Hart hasn't appeared that much than Bronk who is present in the majority of the ZEXAL episodes even though Bronk is useless in the story. We haven't seen Rio and Rei that much in an episode. Though i gotta admit Bronk's role is getting smaller and smaller similer to Bastion in GX. I suggest that for the mean time, Bronk is part of the 6 and when his role gets smaller and a character will have a better role than Bronk then we replace Bronk. Ok? ---- SharkTenjo  04:58, October 21, 2012 (UTC) 
 I have no comment on which character is most "deserving" of being in the sixth spot; I was merely pointing out one possible solution for discussion.  「 ディノ 奴 千？！ 」 ?  ·  ☎ Dinoguy1000  05:01, October 21, 2012 (UTC) 
 Our own  Falzar FZ  has made a colour randomiser for his user page. It's seeded with a few things like seconds since the Unix epoch, number of files, number of registered users etc. --  Deltaneos  ( talk ) 15:58, October 21, 2012 (UTC) 
 I got to looking, and the extension that Uncyclopedia uses for its randomization is  mw:Extension:RandomSelection , which also  appears to be  enabled here.  「 ディノ 奴 千？！ 」 ?  ·  ☎ Dinoguy1000  20:17, October 21, 2012 (UTC) 
 Missing things on Pages, Mislabeled things on Pages, and just stuff like that 
 hello I've been going through the site lately and I've been noticing that in a lot of the pages and lists of monsters and members of archetypes and a bunch of other pages that there has been a lot of stuff that is missing and/or mislabeled on the pages I put stuff on the talk pages for those specific ones that I found but through my experience on Wikis Talk pages dont get looked at all too often so I brought it here so that it can be noticed and fixed and such. the current things I have listed on are the Fiend Members list, Zombie type page, and the Elemental Hero page. there are other things like this on other pages as well but I havent put them on the talk page or havent discovered them yet or whatever. anyways I hope this gets noticed so that the fixes and whatever needs to get done is done. thank you for your time.

 New format 
 I have add a slider, and hole new layout for page  Avatarr  ( talk  •  contribs ) 06:28, December 13, 2012 (UTC)
 
 This  is the layout mentioned. 
 My thoughts in relation to each of the changes you've made:
 I'm not sure why the first heading is being reset to more plain styles. Although I see you tried to change the text colour, but "golden" isn't a legitimate web colour. 
 The additional picture of Yami Yugi seems random. 
 I don't really like how people are always detaching administrators from other users; People feeling that they don't have a say in anything by not being an administrator. etc. I think that line about administrators makes it seem as though only admins are capable of or willing to help people. 
 I'm personally not a big fan of sliders. What goes in them seems arbitrary. 
 You've added some links to pages about the site itself, rather than just its content. That seems like a good idea. 
 Create boxes on a high traffic pages, as far as I know, result in a lot of spam or people creating junk pages, not knowing what they're doing. 
 The changes to the character section is okay. I like both the current way and your suggestion. 
 Overall, I think if we are to work on redesigning the main page, we need to focus on making it shorter, not longer. 
 --  Deltaneos  ( talk ) 12:18, December 13, 2012 (UTC)
 
 Echoing what Delta has already said, the changes add some links to content about us, but overall doesn't add anything to justify the size increase. I'm personally not a big fan of the slider, as it feels a little cheap to me, and the idea of deciding how and what to add/remove every so often is just an additional headache we could do without. Also, I'm a bigger fan of the old character layout than the new one suggested, as I think the older one looks neater, and allows us to clearly define characters and their origin.-- TwoTailedFox  ( My Talk Page ) 13:31, December 13, 2012 (UTC) 
 I don't like the slider, but the addition of links to stuff about the site is good. We could use that to link to policy pages. It would help advertise them better. I like the character section redesign, I was never fond of the tabs to switch series.  Cheesedude  ( talk  •  contribs ) 16:11, December 13, 2012 (UTC) 
 I definitely like that version of the character section better than the current one. The slider seems unnecessary, though it could be changed to toggle through the different series. I get the idea behind the "random" Yami picture; he's the one giving the greeting. I like it. I would say link the part about what to do about needing help to the appropriate forum pages rather than the policy pages, though links to our policies could probably be added as well. But that create page box needs to go; it's asking for trouble. -- Golden Key  ( talk  •  contribs ) 16:35, December 13, 2012 (UTC) 
 I have read all your comments so did a little experiment take a look at new main page redesign look,  MainPage . if you have any comment write it in the  talk page 
highly respet,  Stark   21:44, December 15, 2012 (UTC)
 
 The box at the top of the page looks good. Although, the logo looks a bit repetitive when you view the page in the default skin. 
 You have an unclosed HTML tag somewhere in the code, causing it to break in  Monobook . 
 You've used tables to add boxes and line breaks. Using HTML elements for anything other than their intended purpose makes the page less machine readable and less likely to appear high in search engines. You should really use <div> tags to create boxes and paragraphs, CSS, <div> tags or <br /> to add line breaks. 
 The headings seem a bit clunkier to me. 
 By default, the WikiActivity module appears in the sidebar for every page, except the main page. I don't think we should be giving away a large chunk near the top of the Main Page to something that's easily spotted otherwise. 
 You've removed "Featured Card" and added "Featured Article". It's an interesting idea. At first it seems like broadening the scope. The two concepts are very different things though. A featured article is an article which is considered to be well-written and complete. Featured cards here are nothing to do with the quality of their article. They're reviews of the card, written by editors. I don't think people would be okay with dropping featured cards.
 Featured articles independent of featured cards is still interesting though. But over 47000 of our articles are card pages or other card information pages, nearly 3000 are extra set information pages (list, gallery, ratios) and over 1000 are lists of cards by properties. I don't see how any of them could be considered "well-written" when they don't use much prose. I'm not sure how many of the remaining pages are considered well-written for us to frequently update that section. We'd also have to set up a process for determining what's good enough to be featured, which is really another issue altogether. 
 I've seen very few videos, if not none, that add encyclopedic value. I'm not too keen on the featured media section. 
 "Other sets" should really be directly below "Latest set". You have "Featured Media" between the two. 
 --  Deltaneos  ( talk ) 00:25, December 16, 2012 (UTC) 
 I'm with Neos and the others, I don't like the slider, and I know it's going to cause headaches later by making us decide what to put in the slider, we already have issues with simply doing Featured Card articles, we don't need more problems. I get why Yami Yugi is there, but I don't like him there, from a simple design perspective, he makes that portion of the page seem unbalanced, which isn't really helpful. The characters don't matter too much, but the current way seems to take up less space, but the proposed design makes the page feel whole.  -- Dark  Ace SP  ( Talk )   15:37, December 31, 2012 (UTC) 
 Minor suggestion 
 On the "characters" template, in the ZEXAL layer, shouldn't we say "spin-off" or "spin-off manga" instead of "D Team"?  LegendaryAsariUgetsu  ( talk  •  contribs ) 01:32, December 18, 2012 (UTC)
 
 When speaking in the context of  Yu-Gi-Oh! ZEXAL , as far as I know, people say "anime" to refer to the  Yu-Gi-Oh! ZEXAL  anime, "manga" to refer to the  Yu-Gi-Oh! ZEXAL  manga and  D Team  to refer to  Yu-Gi-Oh! ZEXAL D Team . People might call  D Team , a spin-off, but I don't think they refer to it as "the spin-off". e.g. you might say  In the anime, X happens. In the manga, Y happens. In  D Team , Z happens. , not  In the spin-off, Z happens. . That was my reasoning behind changing it at least. --  Deltaneos  ( talk ) 13:22, December 18, 2012 (UTC)

 Can somebody do something about this guy? He's posted almost a full page of fan-made cards and card proxies and I think it'd be way too tedious to manually delete them all.

 Everything Stretched 
 Rather than the separate anime (Toi, DM, GX, CApsule Monsters, 5D's, ZEXAL) and mangas (YGO, R, GX, 5D's, ZEXAL, D Team) being under separate tabs all defaulting to the latest, are now all separate one beneath the other stretching the page horribly :( ...My understanding is that the main page of a wiki is usually preferred to be compact so that most items can be seen without to much scrolling whilst also being clear :s Personally I thought the old look was clear enough...

 Sort of related; but for the Japanese air dates under Anime it only shows up to episode 113 - I've done a number of null edits and checked all the later pages and can't work out why episodes 114 through to 117 aren't showing up :/ -- 00:24, June 26, 2013 (UTC) 
 Are you referring to the page,  Yu-Gi-Oh! ZEXAL episode listing (season 2) ? It now shows up to 114, but that's because someone has capped it there. If you look at the code, it says  [[Episode series::Yu-Gi-Oh! ZEXAL]][[Episode number::>99]][[Episode number::<114]] . i.e. Episodes from  Yu-Gi-Oh! ZEXAL , whose number is greater than or equal to 99 and whose number is less than or equal to 114. (Yes "≤" and "≥" would make more sense.) 
 When Superlmno  split the list  into two sections, they put an upper limit of 98 on the second list and people have kept increasing it since then. 
 If we actually know which episode that arc is going to end, put in its number. Otherwise just remove the  [[Episode number::<114]]  part. 
 tl;dr? Remove  [[Episode number::<114]]  from  Yu-Gi-Oh! ZEXAL episode listing (season 2) . --  Deltaneos  ( talk ) 01:41, June 26, 2013 (UTC)

 The idea is to choose six characters that are relevant across the entire story. Sora not appearing for one arc does disqualify him from that, as he'll obviously pop back up later. 
 This discussion, plus the one on the GX character portal talk page both illustrate something quite clearly to me. The "six characters from each series" style is fundamentally broken and we need a new format. there is too much ambiguity. 
 So for now, uh, you guys do what you want. But I'd prefer Sawatari over Selena.  Cheesedude  ( talk  •  contribs ) 14:42, May 26, 2015 (UTC) 
 Shingo is one of the firs characters introduced in the series (first as a rival to Yuya). And while it's true that he missed a lot of episodes (basically all the episodes where Sora became relevant) now he is back and he is one of the Lancers and main protagonists. As things are right now (and this began since a few episodes back) Shingo is way more relevant than Sora. Now I'm not saying Sora does not deserve a spot on the main page but, as you said, until we're forced to chose six characters at a time, right now Shingo plays a more important role than Sora. Heck, even Selena now has more importance to the plot than our little psycho friend from the Fusion Dimension lol  Yano88  ( talk  •  contribs ) 17:25, May 26, 2015 (UTC)

 That's the point. The Main Page is an amalgamation of everything we've ever done, and the size of the page showed. Now, Mobile users are an increasingly big part of the visitors to this site; loading this page on mobile was painful at best, and impossible at worst.

 So you removed the Zexal > DM caracters and the agenda of Yugioh product but you did not remove the wired random trivia section, the  stats  section and the  lastes set sectuin 
 At least the Upcomming section is a really important one compared to stats or random trivia. At least that should come back. Also there was nothing wrong with the old TV character list even on mole defices. 
 So please bring back the agenda and old TV characters and remove the other useless stuff like the Statics (or at least reduce them, there will never be any Bandai Yugioh cards, so listing that there is useless) 
 Thunder Eagle 18:26, May 12, 2015 (UTC)
 
 As I said previously, the old sections will be returning on Portal pages, including the list of upcoming sets. If you're eager to see it before then, manually lookup  Templare:News . Also, you must not have even viewed the site on mobile devices for you to think there was nothing wrong. Mobile browsers lack the JavaScript support needed for it to take up the same space; under mobile browsers, the lists would expand, in full, one after the other. 
 Old TV characters will  not  be coming back, because we don't have the space for those, and to keep mobile users happy.-- TwoTailedFox  ( talk ) 19:43, May 12, 2015 (UTC) 
 Still The list of upcomming sets is far more important than random trivia and stats. I think it's better to remove the Static and Trivia sections and replace it with upcomming sets. Than it's fine for me. Right now it's really dumb to remove a important section from the main page because of mobile users while there are 2 far unimportant things on the main page that is also bad for mobile users. Just replace Statics and trivia with upcomming sets and the main page will be a lot better. 
 Thunder Eagle 10:30, May 14, 2015 (UTC)
 I disagree. The Statistics and and Trivia sections draw in new users, as well as provide something factual and interesting. Also, I'm expanding this next bit, because you don't appear to have noticed it the first two times it's been written for you.

 I knew exactly the reaction it would get. There are times when it's applicable to consult the community, and there are times when it is not. Let's run through what would happened had I put this to a public debate: 
 Post created, linked to a duplicate page with the new layout. 
 Because it's a drastic change, people left, and right dismiss it, and claim that it's the worst idea they've seen to date 
 To appease the public, they're asked what they'd like to see in a new main page 
 They want it broadly the same, if not totally the same 
 Back to Square One 
 We get  huge  numbers of mobile traffic in and the Main Page was a direct obstacle. This important of mobile users rarely makes it down the chain, and people seem to either underestimate, or not care. I and the rest of the team here have to perform a balancing act. We have to create a system that functions on both platforms (Mobile and traditional desktop/laptop), yet places neither at a disadvantage over the other. This issue is, frankly, too important to have the community spending weeks, if not months, fruitlessly debating. I get it. People hate change. People hate seeing a different layout to what was there previously. What we had was good for desktop users, but we have to be mindful of others.
 Now, I'm interested in what the community would like to see in the main page  going forward . I can look at rearranging the content, but anything involving JavaScript (such as tabber, etc) is a no-no.-- TwoTailedFox  ( talk ) 23:02, May 14, 2015 (UTC)

 So basicly you let the most uninteresting things stay while the news section was one of the most important things for the community. I understand that you want to keep mobile users happy but 1 compared to other wikki's I think this is already one of the most friendliest ones and 2 why so hyped about Java ? I understand that you want to remove as much java as possible but the news section was just one of the most important things. Even if java is not loaded on mobile so what ? Does it make 
 Also you're saying that the 1% of the new players who are actually interesting in the total cards thing and triva which is the same trivia every day is more important than the most useful tool of the entire wiki, the news section ? I don't want to bookmark 2 pages or click multiple times. I want one click for the releasedate of products. 
 Besides the majority of the community is against removing the news tab. Why do something so undemocratic ? The majority should decide which things are on the main page. 
 Thunder Eagle 22:57, May 15, 2015 (UTC)
 
 The news section was removed because it doesn't function well on mobile, and even has annoyances on desktop. Because the template, due to its vertical size, generates scrollbars on both mobile and desktop. On desktop, this can cause annoyance if using the mouse wheel to scroll, but on mobile, it can interfere with page scrolling itself. The Template itself is one click, so clicking a bookmark for that or a bookmark for the main page is still one click. 
 The next point is going to be uncomfortable for you, but in light of your points at the bottom, it needs to be said.  This is not a democracy . We  welcome  input, and where possible, will try to accommodate users, but at the end of the day, we have concerns that stretch beyond what the community would be able to decide on in reasonable time. There are times when action is required, and there are even deadlines that have to be met. It would be  nice  in an ideal world for communities to decide on such changes, but it simply is not practical.-- TwoTailedFox  ( talk ) 23:19, May 15, 2015 (UTC) 
 I agree that the news section did not worked well, But still it was a important section. Anyway why not redesign the new section ? I'm sure there is a way to make it work on mobile too. It's now written in Java right ? Well I think you can try it with HTML5 or maybe SCS, unfortunately I'm not a developer so I don't know if there are more efficient languages than SCS and HTML. The double-scrolling problem is easy to solve, for example manual arrow keys, and lastly it is also possible to shrink some releases like the Manga promotional cards. Only the big stuff...
 For the time being I think placing a link on the main page to the news section would make a lot of people happy. Waiting for a portal page to appear someday takes to long and I doubt it will be practical.
 As for the Trivia section, I think a lot of people are sick of the same trivia every day. Renew or remove it. my suggestion is to replace trivia with something like a poll or article of the weak, maybe a list of tier 1 and 2 decks which will be renewed every format. Anyway just remove it and replace it with something useful is better. 
 Thunder Eagle 20:52, May 16, 2015 (UTC)
 I'm afraid I still don't understand why you don't provide an  obvious  link to the news section on the home page. Any new users won't know of the existence of another page, unless you present it to them. Also, it is unreasonable to expect users (new or old) to hunt for any important page on their own, whenever there is no guarantee that it even exists on the site at all. Not everyone will come read these discussions, and that's the only way I've been able to find your News Portal.

 "Characters" section from new layout

This is because a) we can fit all 5 anime shows character links on here, rather than just 3 and b) most people focus on the anime rather than the manga and that the main manga cast is just the same from the anime just in a different universe. --FlashEmperor 22:09, May 11, 2015 (UTC)

 Aha, you're using the visual editor. The reason this happens is that card pages, such as Brave Attack, use the template {{ CardTable2 }} to format the information and output it as a template; the information is passed to the template via parameters (stuff like  level  or  ja_name ). When you edit a page using the visual editor, and that page uses a template like CT2, the editor automatically finds the parameters the template supports and lists them all out. There isn't any way, as far as I know, to prevent certain parameters from being listed on certain pages, short of removing those parameters from the template itself, which would prevent them from working on  any  page, even when they're actually needed. The ongoing project to split out specific card types/releases (such as anime and video game releases) to their own templates will help address this problem, but this is a very long-term project, so unfortunately you probably won't see much improvement any time soon. In the meantime, though, you can edit card pages using source mode, which should show you a screen like  this .  「 ディノ 奴 千？！ 」 ?  ·  ☎ Dinoguy1000  21:30, July 17, 2015 (UTC)

 I would like that idea to go through, since I'm a bit saturated of seeing the same characters there over and over again. Also, it's good to call on people's attention. 
 However, what characters would be displayed there? How would they be sorted? We don't have much info on the new ones yet to know how important they are, right?  Becasita   Pendulum  ( talk  •  contribs ) 23:11, April 4, 2016 (UTC) 
 Wait, your idea was to throw all of them?  Becasita   Pendulum  ( talk  •  contribs ) 23:12, April 4, 2016 (UTC) 
 The restriction of six goes back to when the section had a tab for each core series, so that there was some consistency across the tabs. That should no longer be relevant now that the tabs aren't being used. Choosing the most important six has been a tedious unagreable task, as evidenced by the templates' talk pages and page histories. 
 I put in all the ones from the official site's  character page  and used their ordering. They seem to be the most important ones and there's a nice consistent image for each one. --  Deltaneos  ( talk ) 23:31, April 4, 2016 (UTC) 
 Yeah, I won't even try to imagine how those six used to be chosen. 
 A shame they don't have one more to put beneath Bakura. It kinda ruins the symmetry. But putting a totally different image to fill that space would also ruin the criteria, agree. 
 My vote goes to: Yes.   Becasita   Pendulum  ( talk  •  contribs ) 23:40, April 4, 2016 (UTC) 
 Actually, I second this. Great idea Delta.  Sanokal K-T  ( talk  •  contribs ) 03:07, April 5, 2016 (UTC) 
 Eh, I guess. Why not?  Cheesedude  ( talk  •  contribs ) 14:53, April 5, 2016 (UTC) 
 I guess it's best to revert it back to the DSOD characters since the dub's coming out in a month.  Scheepybird  ( talk  •  contribs ) 17:41, December 29, 2016 (UTC)
 
 Shouldn't we update this already? 
 Raging Tempest is already out in the TCG, so it should be listed here instead of Invasion, right? 
I'd do it myself but I'm not entirely sure how....or if I'm authorized

 That's just controlled by  Template:Latest set ; no one's bothered to create one for Raging Tempest yet (but anyone could if they wanted to).  「 ディノ 奴 千？！ 」 ?  ·  ☎ Dinoguy1000  06:25, February 15, 2017 (UTC) 
 Anime Girls? 
 I’m just curious as to why there are no anime  girls  on here. It seems to me that something is, for lack of a better word, sexist. And yes my statistic is based on the sexism of the main page yes, I have no problem with it but just curious. P.S. I don’t recommend adding them if there are that many (you know what type of) girl fans. 
 Well, this turned awkward very instantly. Please undo these 2 revisions if they’re in appropriate. -- Superman37891  ( Talk ), ( Contribs ) 22:14, January 24, 2018 (UTC)
 
 You're not looking in the right places. There are multiple "anime girls" as you put it. This wiki is about Yu-Gi-Oh not general anime. Also, there IS a girl on the main page. Aoi is a girl.  -- MasterMarik  ( talk  •  contribs ) 22:29, January 24, 2018 (UTC) 
 Wiki Background 
 It's hard to see the stuff above the white area of wiki pages because the background color doesn't contrast with it.  The only thing I can clearly see is the Yugioh Wikia logo.   FlareKyn  ( talk  •  contribs ) 01:37, 22 August 2021 (UTC)
 
 The issue is the new mandatory FandomDesktop layout... There is a way to kinda apply Oasis again, called OasisRevived.  Pitifulheartles  ( talk  •  contribs ) 01:43, 22 August 2021 (UTC) 
 English names for SEVENS characters 
 I noticed that even after the release of the English dub of Yu-Gi-Oh! SEVENS many of the names on this wiki are still in Japanese. Could somebody who watches the dub fix this?  Cmonster1993  ( talk  •  contribs ) 15:34, 10 July 2022 (UTC)
