 Appearance 
 Referencing  ikebana  being Japanese art, Lotus wears a red colored  kimono  and what appears to be a hair veil. She has long straight black hair and blue eyes. Between her front bangs and above her eyebrows appears to be a pair of antennae that resemble flower pistil and/or a butterfly's antennae.
 
 Abilities 
 Lotus has the ability to hypnotize people by cutting flower branches, mesmerizing them into slumber. In the dub, this is changed to her being able to put people to sleep with her voice. [1] 
 
 Etymology 
 Her Japanese name "Aika" can be translated as "passion flower" while her English dub name derives from "lotus flower". Her surname can be translated as "Flower of Attachment".
 
 Biography 
 Lotus is part of the  Floral Design Club  at  Heartland Academy . After being brainwashed by  Girag , she invited  Yuma Tsukumo , the  Super Secret Number Card Investigation Club , and  Rio Kastle  to her club where she displayed a dislike for the "worthless" parts of flowers, cutting them up. She initially planned to  Duel  Yuma for his " Numbers " and hypnotized his friends into sleep, though  Ray Shadows  sensed that something was wrong and only pretended to succumb to the hypnosis, and Rio saw through Lotus' scheme and challenged her to a Duel instead. During the Duel, Lotus was cynical and overconfident, subtly insulting and criticizing her opponent on every move she made. After putting up a tough fight, Rio defeated Lotus, returning her to normal, although she didn't remember anything she had done while being brainwashed. [1] 
 After the  Barians ' attack, Lotus and her club were seen arranging flowers for the Heartland Academy Fun Fair. She talked to  Caswell  and told him that she liked his serious nature. [2] 
 
 Deck 
 Lotus plays a  Plant   Burn  Deck . All of her Plant- Type  monsters have the appearance of spaceships, a reference to  Martian Successor Nadesico , made particularly clear with " Battlecruiser Dianthus ". Her primary strategy is to swarm the field with low- Level  Plant-Type monsters in order to Summon her "Dianthus" and further punishes her opponent when they attempt to evade its effect with " CXyz Battleship Cherry Blossom ". She may also go for a  beatdown  strategy via " Flower Judgment ", while " Zen Garden " aids in locking down  WATER  monsters while also supporting her Plants.
