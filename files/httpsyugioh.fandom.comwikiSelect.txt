 Select  (Japanese:  選 択   sentaku ) is an outdated term in the  TCG  (the  OCG  term is still used) used in  card texts  prior to the  Problem-Solving Card Text  update. "Select" indicates that a player decides which card is affected.
 "Select" usually indicated that a card  targets  (the absence of "select" did not mean a card does not target). Some cards that used to say "select", such as " Creature Swap " and " A Cat of Ill Omen ", do not target; such cards now use "choose" to specify that a player decides which card without targeting.
 
 An old print of " Creature Swap " which uses "select". A more recent print of "Creature Swap" which now uses "choose". An old print of " Call of the Haunted " which uses "select". A more recent print of "Call of the Haunted" which now uses "target".
