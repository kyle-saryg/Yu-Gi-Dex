 Summary 
   This summary is currently incomplete. 
 Chumley's  father  Mr. Huffington  has come to  Duel Academy , and wants Chumley to drop out. He believes Chumley is a failure as a Duelist, and is thus wasting his time. He wishes to take Chumley home and help him run the family business. However, he proposes that he and Chumley have a Duel, with the latter being allowed to stay if he wins. That night, Chumley,  Jaden  and  Syrus  work on Chumley's Deck, and Syrus gives him the " Des Kangaroo " card, while Jaden gifts him with " Master of Oz ".
 During the Duel, Chumley makes a mistake on his first turn, Summoning " Des Koala " in  Attack Position , rather than  Setting  it in order to use its  Flip effect . Though Chumley duels wonderfully after that, he ultimately loses to his father's " Flipping the Table " card. However, Mr. Huffington allows Chumley to stay, because he's found such good friends in Jaden and Syrus. Chumley vows to become a better Duelist and make his father proud.
 
 Featured Duel: Chumley Huffington vs. Mr. Huffington 
 
 This Duel uses  Yu-Gi-Oh! GX  anime gameplay . Rules and  card effects  may differ from that of the  TCG / OCG . See the individual card articles for more information.     
 Turn 1: Chumley 
 Chumley   draws  " Des Koala " and subsequently  Normal Summons  it (1100/1800) in  Attack Position .
 Turn 2: Mr. Huffington 
 Mr. Huffington  draws " Dizzy Tiger " and subsequently Normal Summons it (1800/600) in Attack Position. "Dizzy Tiger"  attacks  and  destroys  "Des Koala" (Chumley: 4000 → 3300 LP).
 Turn 3: Chumley 
Chumley draws another "Des Koala". He then  activates  " Koala March " to  Special Summon  a "Des Koala" (1100/1800) from his  Graveyard  in Attack Position and Special Summon another "Des Koala" (1100/1800) from his  hand  in Attack Position. Chumley then  Tributes  his two "Des Koalas" to  Tribute Summon  " Big Koala " (2700/2000) in Attack Position. "Big Koala" attacks and destroys "Dizzy Tiger" (Mr Huffington: 4000 → 3100 LP).
 Turn 4: Mr. Huffington 
Mr. Huffington draws " Dizzy Angel " and subsequently Normal Summons it (1800/600) in Attack Position. He then activates " Hot Sauce Bottle ". When this card is destroyed, it will inflict 500  damage  to Chumley. He then activates " Flipping the Table ". Now  once per turn , Mr. Huffington can destroy all cards he controls besides "Flipping the Table" to destroy a number of cards Chumley controls equal to or less than the number of cards Mr. Huffington destroyed on his field, however he won't be allowed to summon any monsters the turn he activates this effect. 
 Mr. Huffington then activates the effect of "Flipping the Table" to destroy "Hot Sauce Bottle" and "Big Koala". The  effect  of "Dizzy Angel" prevents it from being destroyed by the effect of "Flipping the Table". The effect of "Hot Sauce Bottle" then activates (Chumley: 3300 → 2800 LP). "Dizzy Angel" then attacks  directly  (Chumley: 2800 → 1000 LP).
 Turn 5: Chumley 
Chumley draws " Des Kangaroo ". Chumley's hand contains " Silent Doom ", " Polymerization " and " Destruction Punch ". He then activates "Silent Doom" to revive "Big Koala" (2700/2000) in  Defense Position . Chumley then activates "Polymerization" to  fuse  "Big Koala" and "Des Kangaroo" to  Fusion Summon  " Master of Oz " (4200/3700) in Attack Position. "Master of Oz" attacks and destroys "Dizzy Angel" (Mr. Huffington: 3100 → 700 LP).
 Turn 6: Mr. Huffington 
Mr. Huffington draws "Hot Sauce Bottle". He then activates two copies of "Hot Sauce Bottle". Mr. Huffington then activates the effect of "Flipping the Table" to destroy both "Hot Sauce Bottles" and "Master of Oz". The effects of both "Hot Sauce Bottles" then activate (Chumley: 1000 → 0 LP).
 
 Differences in adaptations 
 In the Japanese version,  Chumley 's  father  ran a  sake  company, and his Deck was similarly Sake-themed. Both " Dizzy " monsters were originally "Drunken" monsters, and " Hot Sauce Bottle " was called "One Bottle of Sake". All references to sake were changed to hot sauce in the dub.
