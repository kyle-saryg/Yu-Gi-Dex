      Jump Festa Logo     
 Jump Festa  is an annual party and exposition in Japan dedicated to anime and manga. Jump Festa is sponsored by  Shueisha . The first Jump Festa took place in Tokyo Big Sight on December 18, 1999 [1]  and has been going on ever since, although the second and subsequent events were held at Makuhari Messe.
 Promotional  Yu-Gi-Oh! Official Card Game  cards have been issued at the first Jump Festa, and at every Jump Festa since the 2004 event. It wasn't until 2006 that a card made its debut as a  Jump Festa promotional card .
