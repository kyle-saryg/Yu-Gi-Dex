 Summary 
 Playmaker wonders how Blue Angel got to where he is. Blue Angel replies that he should be saying "thank you", and taunts the red security bot to chase after her instead. This causes the pair of bots to split up, as seen by  Kitamura , who notices Blue Angel's presence, and slams his fists on the desk, accusing  Akira Zaizen  of using his sister to sabotage him. He calls for someone to "bring Zaizen over", but is told that "Zaizen has already left". One of Kitamura's subordinates calls for the red bot to duel Blue Angel. Meanwhile, Ghost Gal and Akira move towards the data bank. Ghost Gal tells Akira that Blue Angel has arrived, and Akira is immediately annoyed, splitting up from Ghost Gal to save his sister. Ghost Gal stops Akira, saying it's their only chance to reach the data bank first. She also tells Akira to keep his emotions in check, adding that Skye is a grown-up who doesn't need big brother running towards her all the time. 
 Before Blue Angel makes the first move, she addresses her fans as usual, ignoring her A.I. pointing out that the duel isn't being broadcast. During her turn, Kitamura sees Blue Angel bring out her  Link Monster , to his shock. Kitamura then sees the red bot lose Life Points at a steady rate to the effects of Blue Angel's " Trickstars ". After the red bot's turn ends, Kitamura marvels at its progress. When he sees Blue Angel's Life Points down to 1400, Kitamura thinks Blue Angel's the one under stress. More play from the red bot sees Blue Angel's Life Points go down to 400 before summoning another monster. Kitamura believes Blue Angel will be clipped at this point. 
 Blue Angel knows that " Tentacluster Blastsucker " will ram into " Trickstar Lycoris ", with its controller taking no damage due to " Flexible Tentacluster 's" effect, then banish itself to remove the rest of her Life Points. But because her opponent ignored her back row, she can use it to her advantage. As a result, Blue Angel uses her Set card to negate "Blastsucker's" attack, giving her another turn. Kitamura is shocked that his A.I. has been outsmarted.
 Meanwhile, Playmaker continues his duel against the green security bot. He uses the Graveyard effects of his cards to build up his board. The payments to activate " Cynet Defrag " and " Flick Clown " bring his Life Points down to 1000, which Ai informs him of, as well as the  Data Storm  ahead.  SOL Technologies ' security workers inform Kitamura of the abnormality. Kitamura threatens to fire whoever's responsible. 
 Playmaker goes into the Data Storm to use Storm Access, and obtains a new Link Monster - " Vector Scare Archfiend ", which he immediately summons after leaving the Data Storm. Playmaker then summons the monster he drew from "Flick Clown's" effect, and prepares to go into battle. Meanwhile, Akira and Ghost Gal reach the core where SOL's data bank lies. They enter a platform surrounded by lights, and locate a console shaped like a tree root. By then, Playmaker has overcome the green security bot by winning the Speed Duel against it. Kitamura is informed, and makes an irrational reaction. Kolter also sees Playmaker's progress, and wonders if Blue Angel is doing well.
 Blue Angel's turn passes without a hitch, save for losing another 200 Life Points, and she overcomes her barrier as well. Blue Angel celebrates with her catchphrase. As Playmaker and Ai finally reach the core, Kitamura has had enough of one of the workers that he had fired. Another of the workers is brave enough to question Kitamura's competence in his role. Kitamura therefore tries to stay calm, only for a security alarm to fire and another of his workers to tell Kitamura that more have intruded the core. 
 As Playmaker walks through the core, Ghost Gal hides. Akira stays in position, operating on a virtual pad to split the floor to two levels. Akira then walks over to the other level. At SOL Technologies, Kitamura sees Akira from security footage and realizes that he has been sabotaged. Akira himself meets Playmaker and declares that he has been waiting.

As "Dotscaper" was banished, Playmaker activates its effect to Special Summon it (0/2100) in  Defense Position . Playmaker then activates the effect of " Cynet Defrag " in his GY, paying half his  LP  to Special Summon 1 Level 4 or lower Cyberse monster in his GY in Defense Position and  equip  "Cynet Defrag" to that monster (Playmaker: 4000 → 2000 LP).

 The Duel is conducted as a  Speed Duel .
 Turn 1: Blue Angel 
Blue Angel activates the  Field Spell  " Trickstar Light Stage ". As it was activated, Blue Angel activates its effect to add a " Trickstar " monster from her deck to her hand. She adds " Trickstar Lilybell ". As "Lilybell" was added to her hand by a method other than drawing, Blue Angel activates its effect to Special Summon it (800/2000). Blue Angel Normal Summons " Trickstar Candina " (1800/400). As it was Normal Summoned, Blue Angel activates the effect of "Candina", to add 1 "Trickstar" card from her deck to her hand, adding " Trickstar Vision ".
 Blue Angel uses "Candina" and "Lilybell" to Link Summon " Trickstar Holly Angel " (2000/LINK-2/↙↘) to the Extra Monster Zone. Blue Angel activates the Spell Card "Trickstar Vision" to Special Summon a "Trickstar" monster from her hand with its effects negated and ATK halved, then letting both players draw a card. Blue Angel Special Summons " Trickstar Narkissus " (1000 → 500/1800), draws, then subsequently Sets her drawn card. Blue Angel activates the effect of " Trickstar Lycoris " in her hand, revealing it to return a "Trickstar" monster on her field to her hand and Special Summon "Lycoris". Blue Angel returns "Narkissus" to her hand and Special Summons "Lycoris" to the bottom-left Link Point of "Holly Angel" (1600/1200). As a "Trickstar" monster was Special Summoned to a zone "Holly Angel" points to, its effect activates, inflicting 200 damage to Ai-B. As a "Trickstar" monster inflicted effect damage to Ai-B, the effect of "Light Stage" activates, inflicting 200 more damage (Ai-B: 4000 → 3800 → 3600 LP). As Ai-B took effect damage, Blue Angel activates the effect of "Narkissus" in her hand to Special Summon it (1000/1800).

As Ai-B took damage from the effect of a "Trickstar" monster, the effect of "Holly Angel" activates, increasing its ATK equal to the damage taken until the End Phase ("Holly Angel": 2000 → 2200 ATK). Ai-B activates the  Continuous Spell Card  " Abyss Invitation ". Ai-B activates the effect of " Tentacluster Darkwhip " (100/500) in its hand, paying 500 LP to Special Summon it (Ai-B: 3200 → 2700 LP). As a monster in Ai-B's hand activated its effect, the effect of "Narkissus" activates, inflicting 200 damage after the effect resolves (Ai-B: 2700 → 2500 LP). As a player took 500 or less effect damage, the effect of "Abyss Invitation" activates, inflicting 200 damage to Blue Angel (Blue Angel: 4000 → 3800 LP). The effect of "Light Stage" activates (Ai-B: 2500 → 2300 LP), followed by the effect of "Holly Angel" ("Holly Angel": 2200 → 2400 ATK), then the effect of "Abyss Invitation" (Blue Angel: 3800 → 3600 LP). Ai-B then activates the Spell Card " Machine Duplication " to Special Summon two copies of a Machine monster with 500 or less ATK on the field from its Deck. It Special Summons two more copies of "Darkwhip" (100/500 each).
 Ai-A uses the three copies of "Darkwhip" to Link Summon " Tentacluster Nautilus " (0/LINK-3/↙↓↘) to the Extra Monster Zone.

 Ai-B activates the Continuous Spell Card " Flexible Tentacluster ". While active, Ai-B does not take the first instance of battle damage it would take per turn. It also allows Ai-B to Special Summon one of its banished "Tentacluster" monsters. It activates the latter effect to Special Summon "Blastsucker" (400/400). "Blastsucker" attacks "Lycoris". As Ai-B's monster is attacking, Blue Angel activates her face-down " Trickstar Cascade ", returning a "Trickstar" card to her hand to  negate  the attack. She returns "Light Stage" to her hand.
 Turn 3: Blue Angel 
Blue Angel Normal Summons "Candina" (1800/400). As it was Normal Summoned, she activates the effect of "Candina" to add a "Trickstar" card from her Deck to her hand, adding " Trickstar Temptation ".

The first effect of "Holly Angel" activates (Ai-B: 1500 → 1300 LP), followed by "Abyss Invitation" (Blue Angel: 400 → 200 LP), then the third effect of "Holly Angel" ("Holly Angel": 2000 → 2200 ATK). As Ai-B took damage from the effect of a "Trickstar" monster, the effect of "Black Catbat" activates, decreasing the ATK of each of Ai-B's monsters for each monster "Black Catbat" points to ("Blastsucker": 400 → 200 ATK). As Blue Angel controls a "Trickstar" monster, she activates the  Quick-Play Spell Card  "Trickstar Temptation", returning a monster with ATK different from its original ATK to the hand. Blue Angel returns "Blastsucker".
 "Holly Angel" attacks and destroys "Nautilus", with the effect of "Flexible Tentacluster" causing Ai-B to take no battle damage from that attack. "Black Catbat" attacks directly (Ai-B: 1300 → 0 LP).
