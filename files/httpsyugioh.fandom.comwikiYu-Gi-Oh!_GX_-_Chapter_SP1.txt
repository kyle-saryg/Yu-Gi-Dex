 Summary 
 Jaden Yuki  and  Koyo Hibiki  face off for the finals of the "Duel World Tournament America".
 
 Featured Duel: Jaden Yuki vs. Koyo Hibiki 
 The beginning of the  Duel  is skipped.  Jaden   controls  " Masked Hero Gust " (1500/1600) and one  Set  card.  Koyo  controls " Elemental Hero Ocean " (1500/1200).
 
         Jaden  Summons " Masked Hero Blast ".     
 Koyo's turn 
Koyo  attacks  "Gust" with "Ocean", but Jaden  activates  his Set " Mask Change ",  sending  "Gust" to the  Graveyard  to  Transformation Summon  " Masked HERO Blast " (2200/1800); its  effect  activates, halving the  ATK  of "Ocean" (Note: the current ATK of "Ocean" is not shown; it is possible that its ATK was increased by a card effect previously). A  replay  occurs, and Koyo opts not to attack. Koyo activates " Polymerization ", using " Elemental HERO Woodsman " in his  hand  and "Ocean" in his  field  to  Fusion Summon  " Elemental HERO Terra Firma " (2500/2000). He Sets a card.
 Jaden's turn 
Jaden activates " Mask Change II "; he  discards  " Masked Hero Dusk Crow " and  Tributes  "Blast" to Transformation Summon " Masked Hero Divine Wind " (2700/1900). He attacks "Terra Firma" with "Divine Wind", but Koyo activates his Set " Element Counter ",  negating  the attack and inflicting 1000  damage  to Jaden since he has "Ocean" and "Woodsman" in his Graveyard (Jaden 4000 → 3000). Jaden Sets a card.
 Koyo's turn 
Koyo activates " Miracle Fusion ",  banishing  "Ocean" and "Woodsman" in his Graveyard to Fusion Summon " Elemental Hero Gaia " (2200/2600); its effect activates, halving the ATK of "Divine Wind" (2700 → 1350) and gaining the same amount of ATK (2200 → 3550). Koyo attacks "Divine Wind" with "Gaia", but Jaden activates his Set " Emergency Bulkhead ", which prevents the destruction of "Divine Wind" and makes Koyo only be able to attack with one monster this turn (Jaden 3000 → 800). Koyo Sets a card. During the  End Phase , the ATKs of "Gaia" and "Divine Wind" return to their  original values .
 Jaden's turn 
Jaden activates " Mask Charge ",  adding  " Masked Hero Dusk Crow " and "Mask Change" from his Graveyard to his hand. He  Normal Summons  " Masked Hero Ray " (1800/200) and activates "Mask Change", sending it to the Graveyard to Transformation Summon " Masked Hero Koga " (2200/1800). Since Koyo controls 2  monsters , "Koga" gains 1000 ATK (2200 → 3200). Jaden attacks "Terra Firma" with "Koga", but Koyo activates his Set " Higher Dimension Guard ", banishing "Gaia" in order to protect "Terra Firma" from destruction this  turn  (Koyo 4000 → 3800). Jaden activates " Instant Mask Change ", sending "Dusk Crow" from his hand to the Graveyard to Transformation Summon " Masked Hero Shadow Demon " (2800/1200). Jaden attacks "Terra Firma" with "Shadow Demon" (Koyo 3800 → 3500), and next with "Divine Wind" (Koyo 3500 → 3300).
 Koyo's turn 
Koyo Sets 1 card.
 Jaden's turn 
Jaden attacks "Terra Firma" with "Divine Wind", but Koyo activates his Set " Element Fusion ", using "Terra Firma" and his banished "Woodsman" and "Ocean" to Fusion Summon " Elemental Hero Core " (2700/2200). A replay occurs and Jaden opts not to attack. Jaden Sets 1 card.
 Koyo's turn 
Koyo attacks and destroys "Divine Wind" with "Core", with the effect of "Core" doubling its ATK during the  battle  (2700 → 5400); Jaden activates his Set " Residual Reflection ", reducing all damage he takes this turn to 0. The second effect of "Core" activates, destroying "Koga" and "Shadow Demon".
 Jaden's turn 
Jaden activates " Duel ", making both players' hands 6. He Normal Summons " Winged Kuriboh " (300/200). Next, Jaden activates " Polymerization ", using " Masked Hero Bassols " and " Masked Hero Inferno " in his hand to Fusion Summon " Contrast Hero Chaos " (3000/2600).
