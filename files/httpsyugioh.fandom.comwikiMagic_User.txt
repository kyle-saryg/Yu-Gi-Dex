A  Magician  ( 魔 術 師   Majutsushi  or  魔術師   Majishan ) or  Magic User  is a monster from any of the following  Alignments :
 
 Black Magic 
 White Magic 
 Demon Magic 
 Illusion Magic 
 In the  Yu-Gi-Oh! Bandai's Official Card Game , these are used as  Types  instead of Alignments, and a fifth Magician,  Dragon Magic , appears.
 Some cards in the manga, such as " Dark Magic Curtain ", can only be used with one particular type of Magician, while others such as " Magical Hats " can be used with any type.
 In some video games and earlier chapters of the manga, the different types of Magicians have strengths and weaknesses depending on which type of Magician they are battling.
