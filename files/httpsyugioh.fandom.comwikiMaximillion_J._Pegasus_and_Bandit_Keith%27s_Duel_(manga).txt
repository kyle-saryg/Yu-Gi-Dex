 Bandit Keith  and  Maximillion J. Pegasus  faced each other in a game of  Duel Monsters  in the  Yu-Gi-Oh!  manga .
 
 Events 
       New York Duel Stadium , the location of the Duel.     
 Keith Howard , the number one  Card Professor  in the United States, challenged  Maximillion J. Pegasus , the creator of  Duel Monsters  to a Duel. At first Pegasus was not interested, but later accepted under the conditions that the prize be one million U.S. dollars, the Duel take place in a large stadium capable of holding fifty thousand people, be broadcast nationwide and the earnings be split with the sponsors and TV stations. Keith agreed and the Duel took place in the  New York Duel Stadium .
 
       Pegasus  teaching some children the rules to  Duel Monsters     
 Pegasus used the time before the Duel to gather children unfamiliar with the rules and teach them how to play. When the Duel started, Pegasus did not touch his cards. He stared at Keith for a moment, and performed a  Mind Scan , reading Keith's plans for the Duel. He wrote down Keith's cards, strategies and how to counter them on a piece of paper, before calling over one of the children he had been speaking to earlier,  Tom . Pegasus gave Tom the paper and left the table, asking Tom to take over for him. Keith was unhappy with Pegasus' antics, but thought this would at least guarantee him to win the prize money.
 
       Pegasus calls  Tom  over.     
 After a few turns, Keith  Summoned  a  monster , but Tom countered by playing " Flying Elephant " in  Attack Mode , nullifying the fissure attack Keith was attempting and winning the Duel. Tom was surprised by how the paper Pegasus had given him detailed all the moves Keith made and described how to beat him. Keith snatched the paper and was surprised to see that it was true.
 Seto Kaiba , who had been watching the Duel, came to the conclusion that Pegasus had the ability to read the minds of people nearby. He designed some aspects of his  Duel Disks  with this in mind, hoping to combat Pegasus' power.
