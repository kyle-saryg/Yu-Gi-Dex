 EARTH  ( 地   Chi )  monsters  are powerful cards focused on both brute strength and rock-solid defense. EARTH monsters tie with  DARK  for being among the most numerous and widespread; unless a deck is specifically themed around a particular  Attribute , it will almost always have a few EARTH monsters. Decks dedicated to EARTH will often be able to pound an unprepared opponent into the dust; though they rely less heavily upon special effects to win the day, what effects they do have often enhance their combat abilities, such as " Ultimate Tyranno "'s ability to attack every opposing monster in one turn. EARTH is the most common Attribute among  Dinosaur ,  Warrior ,  Rock ,  Beast ,  Beast-Warrior ,  Psychic , and  Plant  Types; although  Insect ,  Zombie  and  Machine  are also quite frequent, there are EARTH monsters in other Types as well. Earth is usually thought of as the opposite of  WIND , although there is no direct advantage other than in certain video games (even if this idea also appears in the effects of some cards like " Desert Twister ", " Milus Radiant ", or " Bladefly "). In a few other contexts it is also seen as the "neutral" element between DARK and  LIGHT , as seen in cards like " Sky Scourge Invicil ", " Warrior Dai Grepher ", and " Warrior of Zera ".
 EARTH monsters are not greatly supported by other cards, although they have a few. These include: " Giant Rat ", " Milus Radiant ", " Missus Radiant ", " The Rock Spirit ", " Gigantes ", " Gigastone Omega ", " Redox, Dragon Ruler of Boulders " and " Warrior Lady of the Wasteland " (for EARTH Warrior monsters). They also have some, albeit not much, Spell and Trap support such as " Gaia Power " and " Spiritual Earth Art - Kurogane ".
