 Biography 
 History 
 Reginald and his twin sister  Rio  lived in a mansion with  their   parents . One night, Reginald was chasing Rio around the house after she stole his Deck of  Duel Monsters  cards that his father gave him. Their fighting resulted in a suit of armor nearly falling on Rio, but Reginald pushed her out of the way, earning a scar on his right shoulder. [1]  One night, Reginald and his family were traveling in a car, which was hit by a truck driven by  Chironex , who was fleeing from the police. All four were hospitalized. [2] 
 
       Reginald and  Rio  under medical attention.     
 All four members of the family died in the hospital. Just after their deaths, the souls of the  Barians   Nash  and  Marin  were transferred into Reginald and Rio, respectively. This was done by  Abyss , after Nash and Marin were killed by  Vector . This revived both siblings, but stripped Nash and Marin of their memories. Thus, Nash and Marin continued living as Reginald and Rio, with the doctors expressing shock that they were suddenly breathing again. [3]

 During  Reginald 's flashback, when Rio stole his  Deck , several cards can be seen after she drops it. [1]
