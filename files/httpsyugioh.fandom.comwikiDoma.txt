For other uses, see:  Doma (disambiguation) 
 Doma  is an ancient organization, which tried to take over the world using the  Orichalcos .
 It has been lead by  Dartz , who also controls the company  Paradius , which aids Doma. Since Doma is unnamed in the English anime, it is a common misinterpretation that Doma is simply the Japanese version name for Paradius.
