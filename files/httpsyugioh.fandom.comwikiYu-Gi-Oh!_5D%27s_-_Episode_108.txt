 Summary 
 Amidst the chaos in the city,  Yusei  and  Primo  duke it out. Primo says that the actions of  Iliaster  are their "God's Will". Primo who has combined with  Terrible Omen , fights in the final evolutionary form of his  Duel Runner . 
 Elsewhere, Lester and Jakob are watching the duel. Lester is still fuming over Yusei receiving a stone tablet - he protests that  they  are the chosen ones, and Yusei doesn't even know what power the tablets possess. He laments that it's bad enough that Yusei knows that such power exists, but Jakob yells at him to be silent and watch the duel. The duel's outcome will determine if they need to be concerned or not. 
 Against Primo, Yusei challenges him by  Synchro Summoning  " Junk Destroyer ". Primo laughs and reminds him that his Meklord can abosrb any Synchro Monster that Yusei summons. Yusei decides to act now and get rid of Melord Emperor Wisel while he still has a chance. Yusei uses the effect of "Junk Destroyer" to  destroy  Primo's set card and " Meklord Emperor Wisel ". Primo counters with " Divergence ", which redirects the effect of "Junk Destroyer" from "Meklord Emperor Wisel" to " Wisel Carrier ". Since the latter can't be destroyed by cards effects, only "Divergence" is destroyed. Yusei then attacks "Meklord Emperor Wisel" with his "Junk Destroyer", but Primo also calls this worthless as he then uses the effect of "Wisel Guard" to redirect the attack to it, destroying it. However Yusei reveals that "Junk Destroyer" can inflict Piercing Damage since "Needle Soldier" was used as a Synchro Material Monster for its Synchro Summon. This angers Primo greatly; he vows to make Yusei pay for doing that. 
 Primo attempts to absorb "Junk Destroyer" with the effect of "Wisel", but Yusei counters with " Star Shift ", which lets him replace "Junk Destroyer" with "Stardust Dragon".  Another  of his Traps ensures that his new Synchro Monster is safe for a turn while also hitting Primo for even more damage. However, Primo ups the ante by replacing "Wisel Carrier" with " Skiel Carrier 3 ", which he promptly upgrades to " Skiel Carrier 5 ". From  Iliaster's  headquarters, a stunned Lester checks his Deck; he furiously discovers that Primo stole some of his " Skiel " cards for his Duel. Yusei recognizes the new monsters as parts of the Meklord Emperor that Leo and Luna  previously   battled  against - he muses that the Duel has become more difficult than ever now that Primo is using "Skiel's" parts to improve "Wisel".
 As Primo uses his powered-up "Wisel" to inflict damage to Yusei even through his defenses, the Meklord Emperor's power causes a massive blackout.  Jack ,  Kaz  and the others react with confusion; in the hospital,  Akiza  realizes that Yusei is fighting to save the city.
 As the only possible means of opposing the  Meklord Emperor , Yusei attempts to perform an  Accel Synchro Summon  to summon  a new card . However, Yusei fails at performing  Clear Mind  after Primo distracts him by reminding him of the Zero Reverse incident. After easily thwarting Yusei's last desperate attack, Primo has " Wisel " absorb " Stardust Dragon ", boosting its ATK to 5000 as it prepares to  attack  Yusei... 
 
 Featured Duels 
 Yusei vs. Primo 
       The Duel starts.     
 The  Battle Royal  mode is still in  effect , so  Primo  starts off with " Meklord Emperor Wisel " ( 1/2500/0), its four parts, as well as 4  Speed Counters  and two  face-down  cards. 
 Turn 6: Yusei (Primo was Turn 5, but it was skipped due to Bruno leaving the battle and Yusei replacing him) 
Yusei's hand contains "Emerging Awakening", "Star Shift", " Quickdraw Synchron ", "Needle Soldier", and " Bicular ". Yusei draws " Quillbolt Hedgehog ". During the Standby Phase, the effect of " Speed World 2 " activates (Primo's SPC: 4 → 5; Yusei's SPC: 0 → 1). Yusei then sends " Quillbolt Hedgehog " from his hand to the Graveyard in order to  Special Summon  "Quickdraw Synchron" ( 5/700/1400) in Attack Position. Since Yusei  controls  a  Tuner monster , he  Special Summons  "Quillbolt Hedgehog" ( 2/800/800) from his  Graveyard  in Attack Position. Yusei then  Normal Summons  " Needle Soldier " ( 1/100/100) in Attack Position. Yusei then tunes "Quillbolt Hedgehog" and "Needle Soldier" with "Quickdraw Synchron" in order to  Synchro Summon  " Junk Destroyer " ( 8/2600/2500) in Attack Position. Since "Quillbolt Hedgehog" has been removed from the field, it is removed from play due to its last effect. Since "Needle Soldier" was used as a  Synchro Material Monster  for the Synchro Summon of "Junk Destroyer", the latter is granted the ability to inflict piercing damage.
 Since "Junk Destroyer" was Synchro Summoned, its effect activates, allowing Yusei to destroy "Meklord Emperor Wisel" and one of Primo's  face-down  cards (one card for every non-Tuner monster used for the Synchro Summon of "Junk Destroyer"), but Primo activates his face-down " Divergence " to redirect the effect of "Junk Destroyer" from "Meklord Emperor Wisel" to " Wisel Carrier " instead. Since "Wisel Carrier" cannot be  destroyed  by Yusei's card effects, only "Divergence" is destroyed. "Junk Destroyer"  attacks  "Meklord Emperor Wisel", but Primo uses the effect of " Wisel Guard " to redirect the attack to itself instead, destroying it. "Junk Destroyer" inflicts  piercing  damage to Primo (Primo 4000 → 2600). Yusei  sets  two cards.
 Turn 7: Primo 
Primo draws. During the Standby Phase, the effect of "Speed World 2" activates (Primo's SPC: 5 → 6; Yusei's SPC: 1 → 2). Primo then  Normal Summons  " Wisel Guard 3 " ( 3/0/2000) in Defense Position. He then  activates  the effect of "Meklord Emperor Wisel" to equip itself with " Junk Destroyer ", but  Yusei  activates his face-down " Star Shift " to  return  "Junk Destroyer" to his  Extra Deck  and  Special Summon  " Stardust Dragon " ( 8/2500/2000) from his Extra Deck in Attack Position. Since "Junk Destroyer" has been removed from the field, the effect of "Meklord Emperor Wisel" resolves without effect as it has lost its original target.  Primo  sets a card.
 Turn 8: Yusei 
Yusei draws. During the Standby Phase, the effect of "Speed World 2" activates (Primo's SPC: 6 → 7; Yusei's SPC: 2 → 3). Yusei then  Normal Summons  " Bicular " ( 2/200/200) in Defense Position. He then  activates  his face-down " Emerging Awakening " to  remove from play  "Stardust Dragon" and inflict damage to Primo equal to the Level of "Stardust Dragon" times 100. "Stardust Dragon" is Level 8 (Primo 2600 → 1800). Yusei  sets  a card.
 Turn 9: Primo 
Primo draws. During the Standby Phase, the effect of "Speed World 2" activates (Primo's SPC: 7 → 8; Yusei's SPC: 3 → 4). Primo then  activates  his face-down " Explosive Blast " to destroy "Wisel Carrier" ("Meklord Emperor Wisel": 2500 → 1700/0) and inflict 400  damage  to  Yusei  (Yusei 4000 → 3600). Primo then  Normal Summons  " Skiel Carrier 3 " ( 3/600/200) in Attack Position (Meklord Emperor Wisel": 1700 → 2300/0). He then Tributes "Skiel Carrier 3" ("Meklord Emperor Wisel": 2300 → 1700/0) in order to  Special Summon  " Skiel Carrier 5 " ( 5/800/400) in Attack Position ("Meklord Emperor Wisel": 1700 → 2500/0).
 "Meklord Emperor Wisel"  attacks  and destroys "Bicular". Since "Meklord Emperor Wisel" destroyed a monster in battle, the second effect of " Skiel Carrier 5 " activates, inflicting 300 damage to Yusei (Yusei 3600 → 3300). Yusei activates the effect of "Bicular" to  Special Summon  " Unicycular " ( 1/100/100) in Defense Position.  Primo  sets a card.
 Turn 10: Yusei 
Yusei draws. During the Standby Phase, the effect of "Speed World 2" activates (Primo's SPC: 8 → 9; Yusei's SPC: 4 → 5). At the same time, the final effect of "Emerging Awakening" Special Summons "Stardust Dragon" from the  Removed from Play Zone  in Attack Position with its ATK increased by its Level times 100 ( 8/2500 → 3300/2000). Yusei then  Normal Summons  " Turbo Synchron " ( 1/100/500) in Attack Position. He then tunes " Unicycular " with "Turbo Synchron" in order to  Synchro Summon  " Formula Synchron " ( 2/200/1500) in Defense Position. Yusei then activates the effect of "Formula Synchron" to draw a card.
 Yusei attempts to  Accel Synchro  by tuning "Stardust Dragon" with "Formula Synchron". However,  Primo  taunts Yusei about how his father  Professor Fudo , who sought human evolution, had caused  Zero Reverse . This breaks Yusei's " Clear Mind " requirement for performing an  Accel Synchro Summon , causing it to fail. "Stardust Dragon"  attacks  "Meklord Emperor Wisel", but Primo activates the first effect of "Skiel Carrier 5" to  negate  the attack.
 Turn 11: Primo 
Primo draws. During the Standby Phase, the effect of "Speed World 2" activates (Primo's SPC: 9 → 10; Yusei's SPC: 5 → 6). Primo then  activates  the effect of "Meklord Emperor Wisel" to equip itself with "Stardust Dragon" and increase its ATK by the ATK of "Stardust Dragon" ("Meklord Emperor Wisel": 2500 → 5000/0).

 Trivia 
 All of the "Skiel" cards that Primo uses in this Duel were stolen from Lester. (He seemingly did this while Lester was next to him during episode 104-105.) 
 Errors 
 The Comcast/Charter preview for the English dub of this episode says: "Yusei duels Placido, but Placido plans to absorb any monster Yusei summons to help him win.", incorrectly referring to Primo by his Japanese name (Placido). 
 In the dub, "Quillbolt: Hedgehog is shown as a LIGHT monster instead of EARTH. 
 In the English dub, when Primo used "Divergence" when Yusei activates "Junk Destroyer's effect", Primo mistakenly explained Divergence's effect as "attack". 
 In the English dub, the order in which the monsters Yusei was going to use to Synchro Summon do not match the order they appear in. The order they appeared in are "Needle Soldier", "Quillbolt Hedgehog" and "Quickdraw Synchron". Instead, Yusei says he tunes "Quickdraw Synchron", "Needle Soldier" and "Quillbolt Hedgehog".
