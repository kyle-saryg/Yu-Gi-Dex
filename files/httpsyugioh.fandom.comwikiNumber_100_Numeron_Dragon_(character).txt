 The Numeron Dragon is a large, serpentine dragon. Prior to creating the universe, it mainly appeared as a golden-hued transparent silhouette with glowing blue eyes and horns; however, after creating the universe, it took on a more detailed appearance, gaining a more predominantly golden body (while maintaining aspects of its black silhouette), with glowing blue eyes and horns, and a glowing blue gem in between its eyes.
 After being reborn as a "Number", it once again gained a new appearance: its form became more solid, and in the shape of a double helix, with golden energy held in between the spirals, while its horns lost their glow and the gem between its eyes disappeared; its eyes changed to green, while it gained a "collar" featuring six orbs around its neck, two pairs of wings, a pair of whiskers attached to its snout, a pair of three-toed arms that feature shoulder plates and the number "100" emblazoned on its right shoulder.

 History 
 This dragon was the first being to exist. As it was lonely, it used its power to create the rest of the universe. This action, however, took nearly all of the dragon's power, and it almost died. Using the last of its power, it shed a single tear, which contained all of its emotions and knowledge. The tear traveled through the cosmos and eventually impacted  Earth , burying the  Numeron Code  there. The impact also created the Moon, where the key to the Numeron Code ended up. The dragon then borrowed the power of the " Numbers " in order to hide its existence. Finally, it left a record inscribed  tablet , detailing the location of the key to the Numeron Code. [1]  The dragon was later reborn as a " Number " when the terms on the tablet were fulfilled. [2]
