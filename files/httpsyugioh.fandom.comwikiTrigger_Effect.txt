 Trigger Effects  (Japanese:  誘 発 効 果   Yūhatsu Kōka , Evoked Effect) are a type of  card effect  for  Monster Cards  that  activate  when a certain condition is met.  Trigger-like Effects  are the parallel type of card effect for  Spell / Trap Cards .
 Trigger Effects are  Spell Speed 1  effects. In general, Trigger Effects can be activated during any  phase , although many individual Trigger Effects have restrictions on the phases in which they can be activated as part of their activation timing. Trigger Effects can be  mandatory  or  optional . Here is an example.  If you control "Starving Venom Fusion Dragon", its effect states: "If this card is Fusion Summoned, you can make this card gain ATK equal to 1 opponent's Special Summoned Monster." If this card IS successfully Fusion Summoned, then its controller can choose when to activate the effect. This is because "IF" effects cannot miss the timing. However, this effect only lasts until the end of the current turn.
 Trigger Effects activate only once each time their condition is met. For example, if you control " Solemn Wishes " and draw 2 cards at once, you will only gain 500 LP (not 1000) because you performed only one act of drawing cards; and if you control " Aromage Jasmine " and gain 1000 LP, you will draw 1 card.

 Identifying Trigger Effects 
 For cards with  Problem-Solving Card Text , Trigger Effects can be identified by looking for a timing or event-related condition, followed by a colon. For example, the text " During the Standby Phase: You can... " or " If this card is destroyed by battle: You can... " indicates that the effect is a Trigger Effect, as they identify a specific phase or event during which the effect activates.
 Optional effects with the activation timing " Once per turn: You can... " or " During your Main Phase: You can... " are  Ignition Effects  rather than Trigger Effects. Trigger Effects may use the phrase "once per turn" in their activation timing, but not on its own.
 Effects with the phrase " during either player's turn " in their activation timing are  Quick Effects  rather than Trigger Effects.
 
 Mechanics 
 Missing the timing 
 Main article:  Missing the timing 
 Optional  Trigger Effects that use the word "when" in their activation timing can miss the timing. This occurs when a optional Trigger Effect that uses "when" meets its activation timing, but another action is performed before it has a chance to activate.
 If an optional Trigger Effect that does not miss the timing or a mandatory Trigger Effect meets its activation timing at an instant that Spell Speed 1 effects cannot be activated, such as when a  Chain  already exists, then it will start a  Chain  at the next possible opportunity. "If" and "during" are commonly used in place of "when" for effects that cannot miss the timing.
 For example, " Peten the Dark Clown " has a "when" optional Trigger Effect. When a monster is  Tribute Summoned  using " Peten the Dark Clown " as  Tribute , first the Tribute "Peten the Dark Clown" is sent to the Graveyard, then a monster is Tribute Summoned. The effect of "Peten the Dark Clown" would have met its activation timing when it was sent to the Graveyard, but because a new monster was Summoned before its effect had a chance to activate, its effect cannot activate.
 In contrast, " Mermail Abysshilde " has an "if" optional Trigger Effect and " Flowerbot " has a mandatory Trigger Effect. If "Mermail Abysshilde" or "Flowerbot" is Tributed for a Tribute Summon, its Trigger Effect can be activated.
 
 Simultaneous Effects Go On Chain 
 Main article:  Simultaneous Effects Go On Chain 
 If multiple Trigger or Trigger-like Effects would activate at the same time, they are all be placed on the same  Chain  without any of them  missing the timing .
 The order these effects are added to the Chain depends on whether the effect is  mandatory  or  optional , whether it is activated by the  turn player  or non-turn player.
 
 Example 
 The effect of "Zaborg the Thunder Monarch" is a  mandatory  Trigger Effect that activates when it is  Tribute Summoned . This effect  targets  1 monster on the  field , then  destroys  that target when it resolves.
