 Lyrics 
 
 Striding the run way  
Spotlight is my way  
Oh oh oh  
I know you want it  
By all excitement  
You gotta love  
Intoxicated by the  
Burning Love  
 
Once I show you all I got  
You will wanna come along  
If you wanna have good time  
I got everything you want  
Everything your heart desires  
Do you dare to have good time  
Ask yourself what you want  
Ask yourself what you want  
Ask yourself what you want  
Is oh...  
That FIRE  
 
Just riding one day  
Right on my Harley  
Oh oh oh  
I saw you lonely  
I feel the hunger  
Just by your eyes  
I gotta have you baby here and now  
 
Once I show you all I got  
You will wanna come along  
If you wanna have good time  
I got everything you want  
Everything your heart desires  
Do you dare to have good time  
Ask yourself what you want  
Ask yourself what you want  
Ask yourself what you want  
Is oh...  
That FIRE  
 
Once I show you all I got  
You will wanna come along  
If you wanna have good time  
I got everything you want  
Everything your heart desires  
Do you dare to have good time  
Ask yourself what you want  
Ask yourself what you want  
Ask yourself what you want  
Is oh...  
That FIRE  
 
Strutting the run way  
Spotlight is our way  
Oh oh oh  
We're gonna love it  
The burn sensation  
In side our souls  
Just feel the fire baby, BABY BURN  
 
Once I show you all I got  
You will wanna come along  
If you wanna have good time  
I got everything you want  
Everything your heart desires  
Do you dare to have good time  
Ask yourself what you want  
Ask yourself what you want  
Ask yourself what you want  
Is oh...  
That FIRE
