 It has been suggested that  this article be merged with   Chain . ( discuss )     
 A  Chain  is what happens when several card effects are trying to happen at the same time. By building a chain, you can more easily determine how the effects resolve.
 Activation  is when you declare an intent to use a card:  flipping  a  Trap Card   face-up , announcing that you are using a  monster 's effect,  flipping  a  face-down   Spell Card , and playing a  Spell Card  from your  hand  are all examples of activation. 
 Resolution  is when you carry out the effects of a card. 
 When you chain multiple  Spell / Trap Cards  together, their activation (intent to use the card) is declared, one after the other. These cards can only resolve once both players stop Chaining (activating) more  Spell / Trap Cards . 
 A simple 2-card chain works like this:
 
 Step 1 is activated ( Spell Card  played,  Trap Card   flipped   face-up , etc.). 
 Step 2 is chained to Step 1 (activated). 
 (neither player wishes to chain additional cards)
(resolve in reverse order)
 
 Step 2 Resolves. 
 Step 1 Resolves. 
 In a 3-card chain:
 
 Step 1 is activated. 
 Step 2 is activated. 
 Step 3 is activated. 
 (neither player wishes to chain additional cards)
(resolve in reverse order)
 
 Step 3 resolves. 
 Step 2 resolves. 
 Step 1 resolves. 
 Note on terminology: Some  Continuous Trap Cards  have effects that can be re-used, such as " Ultimate Offering ", " Skull Lair ", etc. To "activate" these  Trap Cards  is to  flip  the  Trap Card  from  face-down  to  face-up , just like with any other Trap Card. Once the card is activated, you may "use" the card, or "use its effect", or "activate the effect." These are all synonymous terms but are different from activation of the card (which still means flipping the Trap Card  face-up ). The "use" of a  Continuous Trap Card 's effect (which has a  Spell Speed of 2 ) can be chained and can be chained to. You CAN activate (flip face-up) a  Continuous Trap Card  and also use its effect in the same chain. [1] 
 IMPORTANT: When resolving a chain, as the cards resolve they are NOT sent to the  Graveyard  until the entire chain has resolved, or a card specifically  destroys  them. This is important for cards such as " Princess of Tsurugi " and " Secret Barrel " where the effect depends on the number of Spell & Trap Cards on the  field .
 This link provides a detailed explanation of how and what to do on a/card(s) that have been activated in a chain and also how to resolve them properly.

 Example #1:
 Step 1: Player A  Flip Summons  " Princess of Tsurugi ." 
 Step 2: Player B chains " Barrel Behind the Door " to the effect. 
 Because "Barrel Behind the Door" remains on the  field  until the chain resolves, Player A takes 500 points of  damage  (1  Trap Card  on the opponent's side of the  field ) from " Princess of Tsurugi 's"  Flip Effect .
 
 Example #2:
 Step 1: Player A  Flip Summons  " Princess of Tsurugi ." 
 Step 2: Player B chains " Barrel Behind the Door " to the effect. 
 Step 3: Player A chains " Seven Tools of the Bandit " to "Barrel Behind the Door." 
 "Seven Tools of the Bandit" resolves first, and destroys " Barrel Behind the Door ", which is sent to the  Graveyard  immediately. "Princess of Tsurugi" does zero  damage  to Player B because Player B has no  Spell  or  Trap Cards  remaining on the  field  since "Barrel Behind the Door" was  destroyed  and sent to the  Graveyard .
 
 Example #3:
 Step 1: Player A activates " Secret Barrel ." 
 Step 2: Player B chains " Ring of Destruction ", her only card on the  field  or in her  hand . 
 Even though "Ring of Destruction" resolves first, "Secret Barrel" still does 200  damage  to Player B because "Ring of Destruction" is on the  field  when "Secret Barrel" resolves.
