 Description 
 The road to victory has infinite possibilities! Blaze through your own path with " Road Warrior "! 
 
 Featuring: 
" Road Warrior ", A Synchro Monster used by  Yusei  in the anime! When successfully Synchro Summoned, you can Special Summon a Level 2 or lower Warrior or Machine-Type monster from your Deck! You can Special Summon monsters such as " Fortress Warrior ", which can be obtained as a Duel Reward from Yusei, and " Cyber-Stein ", which can be purchased at the Card Trader! 
" Quickdraw Synchron ", This Tuner Monster can be Special Summoned by sending 1 monster from your hand to the Graveyard! It can be substituted for any " Synchron " Tuner monster, meaning you can use it to Synchro Summon monsters from this BOX such as " Nitro Warrior " and " Road Warrior "! 
" Legendary Six Samurai - Shi En ", The ace monster of the " Six Samurai "! Once per turn it can negate any Spell or Trap Card your opponent activates! Foil your opponent's plans by using during your opponent's turn, and attack without fear of your opponent's face-down cards during your turn! 
" Shuffle Reborn ", A Spell Card that lets you Special Summon a monster from your Graveyard if you do not control any monsters. The Special Summoned monster's effect is negated, and it is banished at the end of the turn, so either attack with it or use it as a Tribute or Synchro Material.
