 Yugi and Ryuji's  Dungeon Dice Monsters  game  was a game of  Dungeon Dice Monsters  in the  Yu-Gi-Oh!  manga , played between  Yugi Mutou  and  Ryuji Otogi  over the ownership of the  Millennium Puzzle .
 Without the Millennium Puzzle, Yugi had to play this game without the assistance of  Dark Yugi . Ryuji had hoped for this as he wanted to challenge the one who solved the Puzzle to prove who was a more rightful owner. On the contrary, in the  anime  version of this game, it was Dark Yugi ( Yami Yugi ) who  played  against Ryuji ( Duke ).

 Prior events 
 Mr. Otogi  faced  Sugoroku Mutou  in a  Shadow Game , the  Devil's Board Game , to try and gain ownership of the Millennium Puzzle. However, he lost and became hideously malformed as a  Penalty Game . [1]  Otogi had a son, Ryuji Otogi afterwards and raised him to exact revenge on Sugoroku. [2] 
 20 years later, [3]  when the  Black Clown  opened in  Domino City , a lot of hype was created over it and the mysterious game  Dungeon Dice Monsters , only know as  D.D.M  at the time, which was to be released there. [4]  Yugi and his friends went there after school to check it out. People kept cutting in front of Yugi in the big crowd, causing him to get separated from his friends. Mr. Otogi spotted Yugi and moved him up further in the line. As he did so, he secretly planted some  D.D.M  Booster Packs on him. Afterwards some security guards pulled Yugi into another room and accused him of shoplifting the Booster Packs. They confiscated the Millennium Puzzle and Mr. Otogi pushed Yugi into another room, where he was to face Ryuji in a game of  Dungeon Dice Monsters . Ryuji passed him a briefcase of dice and got him to select twelve to use in the game. He then explained a few of the rules. [5]
