      The Poppo Time.     
 Poppo Time  is the name of the clock shop in which  Yusei ,  Jack ,  Crow , and, later on,  Bruno  live. The owner of the shop, as well as the landlady of the apartments behind it, is  Zora .
 
 Location 
 Poppo Time appears to be situated in a major thoroughfare in  New Domino City . Across the street from the apartment is  Cafe la Geen , Jack's favorite cafe.
 
 Appearance 
 Poppo Time looks similar to an old schoolhouse, made of bricks and whitewashed. A large dysfunctional grandfather cuckoo clock is placed above the front door of the shop, with its internal mechanism accessible in the second floor and the attic. 
 The apartment behind it has an underground garage which serves as the hangout and Duel Runner garage of Yusei and his friends. It is accessible to the street by a ramp.
