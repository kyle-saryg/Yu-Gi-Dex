 Bobasa  is a comic relief character in the  Yu-Gi-Oh!  anime. He is a key switch in the  Dark RPG  that can lead the player to where the Pharaoh's name is if the player gives him enough food to eat.
 After his hunger was sated he had the power to "grant your wish." After bringing Yugi and his friends to the Pharaoh's tomb he vanished and seemed to know a lot more about the situation than he initially claimed.
 
 Biography 
 He is a mysterious NPC in the Dark RPG. The gang meets him in the memory world, and helped find the Pharaoh when he was missing, and took part in several of their plans. In a failed attempt trying to look for the Pharaoh's name in the palace, he asked the gang for food, which they did, then he took them to the Pharaoh's tomb, where the Pharaoh's name is.
