 Shouldn't there be a separate article for the 5D's duel academy? -- Blackstone Dresden  06:09, 19 July 2009 (UTC)
 
 Now to expand 
 Now that they are separated, perhaps it is time to expand this ~MEOW~ Might of the BIRD Empire~~  20:22, 27 July 2009 (UTC)
 
 Girls 
 According to Yugioh GX Tag Force 2 Blair profile, all girls no matter what their grades/skills go to the Obelisk Blue Girls Dorm except for Blair who wants to be Slifer's first female duellist, don't know if you consider it canon, but meh.  Jono R  17:32, September 25, 2009 (UTC)
 
 Two Links of other Academias... 
 I have noticed that there are two other links that connect to two different academies, they are still red at this minute. So if there are no information about them, then why bother have them being "linking"? -- F r e d C a t  11:49, August 7, 2011 (UTC)
 
 Students 
 Should students be added to this page? At the very least of the ones we never see in the series, but are at least mentioned or have their name shown? A list of the top 10 students were shown in episode 51 of GX season 1, even though only 8 names were viewable. -- ShikiKira  ( talk  •  contribs ) 07:57, August 1, 2013 (UTC)
 
 Middle School 
 The anime states that Duel Academy does have a middle school section. Should we add that to this page? Episode 54 shows that middle schoolers wear the same uniform as the high schoolers, but in a completely different color scheme. It also shows that 3rd year middle schoolers have a plum purple jacket, and 2nd year middle schoolers have a green one.  ShikiKira  ( talk  •  contribs ) 19:58, August 1, 2013 (UTC)
