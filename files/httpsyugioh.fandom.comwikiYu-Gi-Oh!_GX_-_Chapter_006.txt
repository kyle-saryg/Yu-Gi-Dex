 The Real Duelist!! 
 
 "Miss Duel Academy" , known in Japan as  "Miss Duel Academia" , is the sixth chapter of the  Yu-Gi-Oh! GX  manga . It was first printed in Japanese in the  V Jump  magazine and in English in the  Shonen Jump  magazine. Both of which were printed in  volume 1  of the  Yu-Gi-Oh! GX  graphic novels afterwards.
 
 Summary 
 Duel Academy  is holding their annual "Miss Duel Academy" competition.  Jaden Yuki  states he hasn't heard of it, and  Syrus Truesdale  informs him that voting has taken place on the Academy's website for the last month. Jaden responds that he doesn't mess around with computers, and that he's not at all interested in the competition anyway. At the ceremony, its revealed that it's a tie - the winner of the last two years,  Seika Kohinata , has tied with first-year  Alexis Rhodes . It's also revealed that every student at the Academy has voted - except for Jaden, meaning his vote will decide the result. Alexis arrives late, as she was not interested in even participating in the competition, but garnered one-hundred and ninety-eight votes anyway. Alexis reveals she wants to just drop out of the competition. Seika suggests that she and Jaden duel, with his vote going to Seika should she win, and the vote going to Alexis should he win.
 Alexis responds that she doesn't want someone else making this decision for her, and the judge suggests that Seika duel Alexis instead. However, she believes that Alexis is just as good as  Chazz Princeton , and that she would have no chance of beating her. She then recalls that Jaden defeated Chazz, and determines that her dueling either of them would result in a loss for her. Alexis decides that she'll duel Jaden instead, and should she win, she'll be permitted to withdraw from the competition, while if she loses, Jaden's vote goes to Seika. Either way, this would benefit Seika, so she accepts. Alexis urges Jaden to treat her as a duelist, not as a girl, and the duel begins.
 Alexis Summons " Cyber Valkyrie " in  Defense Position  and  Sets  " Cold Fusion ". Jaden Summons " Elemental Hero Heat "  Attack Position . Jaden attacks, and this  activates  the effect of "Cyber Valkyrie", reducing the ATK of "Heat" by 300, causing Jaden to take 200 damage. Alexis begins her turn, Summoning " Cold Enchanter " in Defense Position and Setting another card, declaring that all of her preparations are complete. Jaden plays " Polymerization ", fusing the " Elemental Hero Woodsman " and " Elemental Hero Ocean " in his  hand  to  Fusion Summon  " Elemental Hero Terra Firma " in Attack Position. Alexis declares that "Terra Firma" will be leaving the  field  early as the chapter ends.
