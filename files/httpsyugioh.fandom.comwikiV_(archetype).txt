 " V " ( Ｖ   Bui ) is an  archetype  of  Level  4  Spellcaster   monsters  used by  Yuma Tsukumo  in the  Yu-Gi-Oh! ZEXAL  anime, which were given to him by  Ray Shadows  to support " Number C39: Utopia Ray V ".
 The introduced non- Xyz Monsters  are all based on the four  elementals  described by  Paracelsus . 
 These cards were given to Yuma by Vector as a "sign of Yuma and Ray's friendship", with the intention of Yuma keeping them in his  Deck  because of that, so that Vector could destroy Yuma with " Vain Betrayer " (whose anime effect is a deadly  anti -"V" effect). The cards have not been seen since.
