 This is the only Monster used by the  Three Pure Nobles  that is not from the " Meklord "  Archetype . 
 This name is nod to its effect. It drains its opponent's  ATK  but gains ATK points equal to the opponent's monster's  DEF  which one would think is absurd. In  Yu-Gi-Oh! 5D's Tag Force 5 , however. Attack Points are only halved and it can only be used on Level 4 or lower monster, making it less absurd.
