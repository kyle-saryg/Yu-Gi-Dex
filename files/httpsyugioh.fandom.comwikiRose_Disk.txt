 History 
 Akiza used this Duel Disk since childhood, possibly obtaining it from  her father . She used it throughout the  Fortune Cup  and  Dark Signers  arcs. 
 After  Yusei  was kidnapped by  Boss  so he'd agree to race for him in the  WRGP , Akiza and  Mina Simington  were able to find where he was being held hostage. Akiza activates the Rose Disk and has  Rose Tentacles  break the door on the truck open. Boss notices this and orders to speed up the truck. Mina and Akiza still manage to catch up with it, but Yusei warns Akiza and she impulsively jumps to one of the doors. As Yusei helps her get on board, the door falls off taking her Rose Disk along with it.
