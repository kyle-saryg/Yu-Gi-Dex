 OCG Rulings 
 Since  Ancient Gear Golem  requires 2  Tributes  to  Tribute Summon , when using the effect of  Ancient Gear Castle  to substitute itself for the  Tributes , there must be 2 or more counters on it. Therefore, you cannot use 2 copies of  Ancient Gear Castle  that each only have 1 counter on them. [1] 
 Previously Official Rulings 
   These TCG rulings were issued by  Upper Deck Entertainment  and have since been deemed unofficial by Konami. [2]  They were previously considered official and can still be correct, as long as they follow the official gameplay rules, or unless Konami has issued a ruling that says otherwise. References:  [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] 
 
 For “ Ancient Gear Castle ”, “ Set ” means to Set from the  hand . It does not include using “ Book of Moon ” or “ Guardian Sphinx ” to flip a monster  face-down , or  Special Summoning  a monster in  face-down   Defense Position  with “ Cyber Jar ” or “ The Shallow Grave ”.
