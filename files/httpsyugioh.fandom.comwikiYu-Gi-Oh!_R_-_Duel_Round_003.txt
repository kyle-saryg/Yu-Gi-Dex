 "Kaibacorp Duel Begins!!" , known as  "Battle at Kaiba Corporation, Start!!"  in the Japanese version, is the third chapter of the  Yu-Gi-Oh! R  manga. It was first printed in Japan on June 21, 2004 in V-Jump magazine. It was later reprinted in volume 1 of Yu-Gi-Oh! R.
 
 Summary 
 After Dueling  Yako Tenma  on the rooftop,  Yugi Mutou ,  Katsuya Jonouchi , and  Hiroto Honda  all rush to  KaibaCorp  headquarters to duel their way to their friend  Anzu Mazaki . However, upon arrival to KaibaCorp, Yugi and his friends are confronted by  Deschutes Lew  the first  card professor . He gives Yugi Anzu's soul, contained in a " Soul Prison " card. Deschutes welcomes them to KaibaCorp and starts explaining that there are thirteen total Card Professors scattered throughout the block areas of the tower. He then challenges Yugi to a Duel with the ante being Anzu's soul card for the key card to get into the building.
 Yugi starts off with a  Set  card and  Queen's Knight . Deschutes simply Sets two cards and summons  Gear Golem the Moving Fortress  in  Defense Position . On his next turn, Yugi gathers his three Knights, and Jonouchi and Honda remark that Yugi can summon his God cards soon, though Deschutes is unconcerned, believing that he has control over the whole duel.
 He brings out  Castle Gate , and uses it's effect to attack Yugi directly. Refusing to let his monsters be used against him, Yugi brings out  Dark Magician , but Deschutes takes control of it. Yugi simply returns control of his Magician back to him with  Owner's Seal , and wipes out Deschutes' life points.
 After Deschutes loses the Duel, there is a scene of Yugi and the " Dark Magician " standing back-to-back.
 
 Featured Duel: Dark Yugi vs. Deschutes Lew 
 Turn 1: Dark Yugi 
 Yugi  draws. He then  Sets  a card and  Normal Summons  " Queen's Knight " (1500/1600) in  Attack Position .
 Turn 2: Deschutes 
 Deschutes  draws. He then Normal Summons " Gear Golem the Moving Fortress " (800/2200) in  Defense Position  and Sets two cards.
 Turn 3: Dark Yugi 
Yugi draws " King's Knight " and subsequently Normal Summons it (1600/1400) in Attack Position. The  effect  of "King's Knight" activates as Yugi already  controls  " Queen's Knight " when it was summoned, letting him  Special Summon  " Jack's Knight " (1800/1200) from his  Deck  in Attack Position. Yugi then activates " Lightning Blade " and  equips  it to "Jack's Knight", increasing its  ATK  by 800 ("Jack's Knight": 1800 → 2600/1200). "Jack's Knight" attacks "Gear Golem", but Deschutes activates his  face-down  " Negate Attack ",  negating  the attack and ending the  Battle Phase .
 Turn 4: Deschutes 
Deschutes draws. He then  Tributes  "Gear Golem" to  Tribute Summon  " Castle Gate " (0/2400) in Defense Position. He then activates " Brain Control " from his hand to take control of "Jack's Knight" until the  End Phase . He then activates the effect of "Castle Gate", Tributing "Jack's Knight" to inflict  damage  to Yugi equal to the Tributed  monster 's total ATK (Yugi: 4000 → 1400).
 Turn 5: Dark Yugi 
Yugi draws. He then Tributes "Queen's Knight" and "King's Knight" to Tribute Summon " Dark Magician " (2500/2100) in Attack Position. Deschutes activates his face-down " Forceful Deal ",  paying  half his  Life Points  (Deschutes: 4000 → 2000) to  destroy  "Castle Gate" and take control of the "Dark Magician". Yugi activates his face-down " Owner's Seal " and chains it to the effect of "Forceful Deal", returning all monsters on the field to their original  owner 's side. Yugi attacks Deschutes  directly  with the "Dark Magician" (Deschutes 2000 → 0).
