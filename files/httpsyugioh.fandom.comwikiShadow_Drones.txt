      A group of Shadow Drones preaching.     
 Shadow Drones  are people who served the  Dark Signers  while  possessed  through spiders. Shadow Drones are unnamed in the Japanese version, but refer to themselves as Dark Signers. [1] 
 
 Properties 
 The Dark Signer associated with  Earthbound Immortal Uru  has the ability to control spiders. That present day Dark Signer is  Roman . By latching the spider onto a person, that person can be possessed. [2] 
 As a Shadow Drone, the victim's Deck is changed to that more fitting of a Dark Signer. [2]  Such as including a  Dark Synchro Monster . The Shadow Drone gains some Dark Signer powers, such as the ability to  Shadow Duel . After losing a Shadow Duel, the victim and their Deck is returned to normal and they have no recollection of what happened while possessed. [1] 
 
 Appearances 
 After the  Fortune Cup , the Dark Signers turned a number of people in  Satellite  into Shadow Drones and dispatched them into the streets to preach that the  Crimson Dragon  is evil. While other people, including  Grady  listened, spiders were lowered onto them, in order to possess them. [1] 
 While visiting  Domino Hospital ,  Trudge  comes into contact with a spider and gets possessed. [3] 
 The Dark Signers use Grady and Trudge to target  Yusei Fudo  and  Jack Atlas  respectively. Both Shadow Drones lose and are returned to normal afterward. [2] [3] 
 Ultimately, the residents of Satellite were turned into Shadow Drones for a more sinister motive; To be used as sacrifices for  Kalin Kessler 's " Earthbound Immortal ", " Ccapac Apu ". [4] 
 Trudge is turned into a Shadow Drone a second time, shortly after Yusei defeats  Kalin . Through Trudge,  Roman  invites Yusei to come and face him. The spider then leaves Trudge, returning him to normal. [5]
