 Biography 
 When  Yusei  was  attacked  by  Roman 's " Underworld Flood Dragon Dragocutos ", a brief vision of Ish and Roman being pierced by  Rex  with a jousting lance appeared in his mind. [1] 
 
       Ish laughing at Goodwin     Later, when Roman was defeated by Yusei, he told Yusei about his and Rex's history. 5000 years ago, they both were poor kids who had nothing and had to steal in order to survive. One day, Ish found them and adopted them as her brothers, giving them names - Roman and Rex Goodwin. She was also revealed to be the best  Duel Priestess  in several generations. [2] 
 On the day of the  Festival of Duality , Ish was chosen as the Duel Priestess and her young brothers came to see her off but she never returned. When Rex and Roman ask the high priests about what happened, they explain that Ish lost the ritual and due to her loss, she was sacrificed as per the rules of the ritual. Honoring her last request, the high priests made Rex and Roman Duel Priests. After remembering that the  Ultimate God  grants one wish to the winner of the festival, Rex and Roman began to formulate a plan to wish Ish back to life. 
 Tricking the  next Duel Priestess  to lose on purpose, Roman heads to the  Aerial Fortress Seibal  and wonders if Rex had already made it. But as he moves on ahead, Roman sees his brother and a revived Ish Dueling each other, both under the influence of shadow miasma and unable to recognize each other. As Rex is about to stab Ish with his lance, Roman jumps in his path and is stabbed alongside Ish. Regaining her senses Ish reveals to Roman that she and Rex were corrupted by the Ultmate God's shadow miasma and pleads with Roman to save him as they both succumb to their wounds and die. In the present, Ish's corpse is placed in the  Machine Temple . When Roman as the  Skeleton Knight  loses his Duel against Yusei, the temple collapses on him, killing him and allowing him to reunite with Ish in the afterlife. [3]
