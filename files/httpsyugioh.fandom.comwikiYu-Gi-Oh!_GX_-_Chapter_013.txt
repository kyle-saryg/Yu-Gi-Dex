 "Showdown! Who Will Win?" , known as  "Conclusion of the Hero Showdown?!"  in the Japanese version, is the thirteenth chapter of the  Yu-Gi-Oh! GX  manga . It was first printed in Japanese in the  V Jump  magazine and in English in the  Shonen Jump  magazine. Both of which were printed in  volume 2  of the  Yu-Gi-Oh! GX  graphic novels afterwards.
 
 Summary 
 Jaden Yuki  attacks  Koyo Hibiki 's " Elemental Hero Inferno " with " Elemental Hero Flame Wingman ", and " Skyscraper "  activates , increasing the attack points of the latter. The former is  destroyed , while "Flame Wingman's"  effect  activates, dealing damage to Koyo equal to his destroyed monster's attack points, reducing him to 900  Life Points . Koyo activates his  face-down  " Hero Signal ",  Special Summoning  " Elemental Hero Ocean " from his  Deck  in  Attack Position . "Inferno's" effect also activates upon its destruction, letting Koyo add " Pot of Greed " from his  Graveyard  to his  hand . Koyo begins his turn, playing his "Pot of Greed" to  draw  two cards.  Midori  comments that "Skyscraper" is a double-edged sword, especially in battle between " Elemental Heroes ".
 Koyo  Summons  " Elemental Hero Woodsman " in Attack Position and proves Midori's point correct as he uses "Ocean" to destroy "Flame Wingman" via "Skyscraper's" attack-boosting ability, which only activates for the turn player, regardless of who originally played it. "Woodsman" attacks  directly , reducing Jaden to 1000 Life Points. Koyo comments that "Skyscraper" is the best  Field Spell  for "Elemental Heroes", but since it affects both players, he can use its effect too. He  Sets  a card to end his turn. Jaden comments to himself that he played "Skyscraper" fully prepared for that, and as he draws, Midori thinks this draw may decide the duel, as Jaden's hand is empty. Jaden draws "Pot of Greed", and plays it, drawing two more cards. He then Summons " Elemental Hero Clayman " in Attack Position and is about to attack "Woodsman". Koyo activates his face-down " Mystical Space Typhoon ", destroying "Skyscraper". Midori is perplexed as to why Koyo didn't activate "Mystical Space Typhoon" during the  Damage Step , as he could have destroyed "Clayman" had he done so. She realizes that Koyo just wants to enjoy his duel with Jaden for as long as possible. Jaden activates " Swords of Revealing Light ", and Koyo comments he chose the wrong moment to use "Mystical Space Typhoon".
 Koyo draws, and feels intense pain as he now truly dueling seriously. He vows not to collapse in front of Jaden, and assures Midori that he'll be fine. He switches "Ocean" and "Woodsman" to  Defense Position  and Sets a card to end his turn. Jaden draws, and then Summons " Elemental Hero Sparkman ", who attacks and destroys "Ocean". Koyo draws, feeling the pain again, and still not knowing why. He passes his turn. Jaden draws, and plays " Polymerization ", fusing "Clayman" and "Sparkman" to  Fusion Summon  " Elemental Hero Thunder Giant ", whose effect activates, letting Jaden destroy "Woodsman". Jaden attacks directly, believing he's won, but Koyo activates his face-down " Residual Reflection ",  removing  "Woodsman" and "Ocean" in his Graveyard from play to reduce the damage to zero. Koyo praises Jaden for nearly winning, but comments that "Swords of Revealing Light's" effect is now disappears, as it's been three turns. Koyo draws, expecting to feel pain once more, but finds he doesn't, as he draws his partner, " Winged Kuriboh ". He thanks  its spirit  and Summons the card in Defense Position to end his turn. Jaden draws " Fairy Meteor Crush " and  equips  it to "Thunder Giant", believing he can win with the  Piercing  effect that the former card will grant him.
