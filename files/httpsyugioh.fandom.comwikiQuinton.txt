 Appearance 
       Quinton's appearance.     
 For his clothing, he tends to wear quite long and dark clothes, which consist of a long blue and white coat with yellow accents and a high collar that is blue underneath and fits in with his hair and white pants. While Trey and Quattro wear the same footwear, he doesn't, maybe highlighting how he is the eldest. Unlike his brothers, who wear boots, he has white shoes. Like his brothers, he has a  Duel Gazer  tattoo, which is green. Quinton's  D-Pad  is two pale golden triangles separated by a layered infinity symbol, with the Roman numerals V on one side and IX on the other, which represent his name and his " Number " card, " Number 9: Dyson Sphere ", respectively.
 When Quinton was younger, he had his hair done similar to his father, with a braid resting over his left shoulder. By the time he left  Kite Tenjo , his hair was loose and seemed to be the exact same length as it is in present times.
 
       Quinton's crest     
 While his younger brothers,  Trey  and  Quattro , have a  crest  on their hands; Quinton's crest is blue and on his forehead. He has blue eyes and long flowing silver hair with light purple fringes and one light turquoise in the middle.
 
 Personality 
 As the eldest brother of the  Vetrix Family , Quinton is the most rational and calmest of his brothers, even more so than  Vetrix  at times. When he was younger, Quinton was gentle and mature to others, looking out for his younger brothers and made sure they behaved. [7]   When living with  Kite , Quinton grew fond of him and taught him how to Duel to protect his own younger brother,  Hart . After learning of his father's fate, Quinton became cold and stoic, blaming his father's condition on  Dr. Faker . [2]  Assisting with Vetrix's revenge, Quinton kept his brothers in line and was usually shown with his father conversing over important issues.
 Quinton acts cold and ruthless when he Duels, as well as egotistical, shown by his incredibly angry reaction towards  Yuma  after taking only 400  damage  from  Yuma 's  card effect  during the  Duel Coaster  event. [6]  He has an intense hatred of Dr. Faker due to what he did to Vetrix and ruining his family, with which he also blames Kite for doing his father's dirty work. [8]  After his father's return to his old persona, these traits vanished and Quinton became kinder and returned to being friends with Kite. [9] 
 
 Etymology 
 In contrast to his brother's names, his name is pronounced as the letter "V" as opposed to the Roman numeral for "five". Quinton means "fifth, the fifth, fifth child" in Latin.
 
 Abilities 
       Quinton's bracelet     
 Quinton's  crest  grants him various powers. It allows him to take control of others, as seen when he uses it on  Hart Tenjo  in order to make him get into his helicopter and take him to  Vetrix . [10]  He is also able to perform telekinesis, as shown when he raised and moved Hart in the air. [11] 
 His crest comes with a price - it is directly connected to his soul; therefore, should he lose a Duel while wielding a powerful " Number ", his soul will become exhausted and he will fall comatose. [12] 
 Like his brothers, he also has one of the bracelets that he invented, which granted him their father's crest abilities. [9] Also like his brothers, he suffers pain from the device when Summoning  Number C9: Chaos Dyson Sphere . [13] 
 
 Biography 
 History 
         Chris with his family.     
In the past, Chris along with his brothers and their father,  Byron , lived a happy life, and they had a dog. Their father gave Michael a Duel Monsters card - " Chronomaly Aztec Mask Golem ".          Young Chris promising to teach his two sibling about dueling.     Thomas was jealous because only Michael received a card and tried to take "Mask Golem" from him. Chris told them to stop or their father will scold them and then promised to teach both of his brothers how to Duel. [7] 
When Byron became involved in  Dr. Faker 's experiments, Chris accompanied him in the lab.          Chris alongside his  father  and  Dr. Faker  getting help from  Kazuma  on their research.     They were attempting to find the door that would lead to parallel dimensions, he was assigned to find  Kazuma Tsukumo , an adventurer who was trying to find the same thing. Kazuma agreed to help them, and after examining their theory, he told them what was wrong with it. They had been operating under the assumption that were twenty-one passage points.  By analyzing that data, they could determine where the door would appear next. Kazuma revealed that there were actually twenty-three passage points, something he had determined while adventuring.          Chris saying goodbye to his father.     With that new data, they determined where they needed to go, but Chris stayed behind. Byron, Kazuma and Faker traveled to the destination. [1] 
 His father did not return from the trip, Chris' brothers were sent to an institution, while he remained at Dr. Faker's facility in an attempt to learn of his father's fate. Here he met  Kite Tenjo  and  Hart Tenjo , Faker's sons, and they reminded him of his own brothers. 
 
         Chris as Kite's mentor.     
 Kite wished for power to protect Hart, and Chris taught him how to play  Duel Monsters  to suit that purpose. [2]  During this period it is seen that he was an extremely strict mentor, as he and Kite in one instance Dueled for several days without rest, with Chris pushing Kite to unhealthy limits. [14]  Chris eventually left the facility after learning about what really happened to his father. [2]  Faker betrayed his father and Kazuma by offering them as sacrifices, which lead to parallel dimensions through the portal. When Byron returned, his form was warped into that of a child and he swore revenge against Dr. Faker. Chris' father told him him what had happened and took the name "Vetrix", while Chris became known as "Quinton". Vetrix imbued each of sons with a  crest , which granted them great power. However, it was directly connected to their souls, so should they lose a Duel while wielding a powerful " Number ", they will fall comatose. [12] 
 
 Yu-Gi-Oh! ZEXAL 
 World Duel Carnival Preliminaries 
         Quinton gathered along his family to hear  Quattro 's success.     
 After  Quattro  gave  Shark  a  Heart Piece , he returned to  Vetrix  to inform him, which Quinton and his brother,  Trey  witnessed. [15] 
 
During the morning of the second day of the  World Duel Carnival , Quinton was reading a book while Quattro was choosing his targets by throwing the " Numbers " that they have collected at them. Seeing this, Quinton commented that Quattro is too brash and suggested he treat the "Numbers" he's collected better. Angered by Quinton challenging his ethics, Quattro suggested Quinton try collecting "Numbers" himself and challenged him but is quickly shot down by Quinton being reinforced by  Trey  and Vetrix.          Quinton reprimanding Quattro for being rude to their father.     After insulting Vetrix, Quinton rose to his feet and tells him he won't tolerate that causing Quattro to quickly back off. Quinton walked over to the "Numbers" that Quattro had thrown on the wall and gave Trey " Number 32: Shark Drake " and instructs him to give it to Shark. After his brothers left, he looked at  Heartland Tower  and swears that he will get revenge for what  Dr. Faker  has done. Vetrix saw him do this and informed him that no matter what, Dr. Faker mustn't know that he is alive. [16] 
         Quinton arrives to take Hart.     
 After  Hart Tenjo  escaped from Heartland Tower, he was chased by  Dextra  and  Nistro  in a helicopter which results in them going to a tower in order to meet Kite. Soon after, a helicopter appeared in which Hart,  Yuma Tsukumo  and  Tori Meadows  thought was piloted Nistro and Dextra, resulting in Hart using his powers. After Yuma calmed Hart down with a piece of caramel, the helicopter landed, but instead of Dextra and Nistro, the person piloting it was in fact Quinton. He used his  crest  to take control of Hart in order to take him to Vetrix. He then flew off, leaving Yuma and Tori confused as to who he was and what he wanted with Hart. [10] 
 
         Quinton using his  crest 's power.     
 Quinton transported Hart to the abandoned gallery where Vetrix began his ritual to steal his powers. After Yuma, Kite,  Tori  and  Orbital 7  arrive there, Quinton sent Quattro and Trey to stall them so that the ritual is completed. [4]  Quinton watched the Duel as he's focused on  Kite  just like his brothers are. Like them though as well, he's surprised upon learning that Yuma possesses a "Number" card as well. [17]  He wass even more surprised to see that Yuma can use a " Number C ", then realizes that his surname is "Tsukumo" and starts wondering about something. [18] 
 
         Quinton tells Yuma that his father is alive.     
 After the Duel, he told Yuma that his  father  was still alive in the  Astral World . When Vetrix finished testing out his newly obtained power, Quinton informed him that Yuma possesses the original Number. Vetrix then asked him if Yuma is the son of  Kazuma Tsukumo , which Quinton clarifies as correct. [11] 
 After Vetrix gave some of his powers to Trey, Quinton looked worried when he stands on the balcony with Vetrix. Vetrix told him not to worry about Trey because he will not lose to Yuma, but Quinton still looks doubtful. He was proven right when Trey lost, forfeiting a  Heart Piece  and his two "Numbers" in the process. Trey went into a coma when he returned home. [7] 
 
 World Duel Carnival Finals 
         Quinton advising Kite.     
Quinton attended the WDC Finals party, where he was confronted by his former student,  Kite . Kite grabbed him by the collar, asking how his family could do what they did to  Hart . Quinton responded that they simply follow  Vetrix 's orders and that he cannot hope to defeat Quinton or Vetrix in his current state.          Quinton hires the triad.     Later, Quinton made a transaction with the  Triad of Terror , hiring them to defeat  Yuma . [5] 
The next day, the competition continued aboard the  Duel Coaster , and Quinton saw Kite again before boarding and exchanged glances. Quinton saw  Quattro  and  Shark  each defeat an opponent easily, taunting one another in the process, and commented how Quattro is as feisty as ever.          Quinton on the  Duel Coaster .     As what is coming next is unknown, Quinton decided to focus on conserving his  Life Points  and taking strategic advantage of the Duel Coaster's  Spell  and  Trap Cards . An  opponent  approached him from behind, immediately  attacking   directly  with his " Vylon Disigma ". Quinton told him that anyone who approached him would be engulfed in hellfire. He activated his  face-down  " Infernal Sun ", defeating the Duelist in an  OTK  as he had five cards in his  hand , taking 800  damage  for each of them. Afer that, he hit a Spell Point, which was " Dian Keto the Cure Master ", giving him 1000 more Life Points. [19] 
         Quinton battles  Nistro .     
 When the Duel Coaster moved into the underground track, Quinton was approached from behind by  Nistro , who wished to exact revenge for being humiliated when he failed to get Hart back after Quinton kidnapped him. Quinton  negated  Nistro's first attack, causing Nistro to tell him to fight with his full strength. Quinton claimed he didn't need to use his full strength to defeat Nistro and proceeded to inflict heavy damage with more Spell and Trap Cards. Nistro was saved by Yuma and the effect of his " Achacha Chanbara ". This also caused Quinton to take 400 damage, which angered him greatly. When he was about to counterattack, Vetrix called him, asking if he was going to Summon a monster and telling him to wait and let Nistro struggle some more. Doing as he was told, Quinton switched lanes. [6] 
 
         Quinton Versus Kite.     
 Quinton and Kite arrived at the Space  Duel Field , " Space Field ", where Quinton remembered the day he become filled with hate. They began their Duel, with Quinton bringing out " Number 9: Dyson Sphere " on his first  turn , which sealed Kite's attacks. When Yuma,  Tori Meadows  and  Orbital 7  arrived, Quinton explained that Vetrix is his father and revealed his past history with both Dr. Faker, who is Kite's father and Yuma's father,  Kazuma Tsukumo . [1]  Quinton was able to reduce Kite to a mere 100 Life Points with "Dyson Sphere". He questioned why Yuma considered Kite to be a friend and was reminded of Kazuma by Yuma's answer. Quinton still questioned how Yuma could have the son of the person responsible for his father's absence as a friend. Quinton told Kite his family had thrown away their own names for revenge. [2] 
 
         Quinton falls unconscious.     
 He wished to save his father, but his heart was already filled with revenge when he returned. Kite told him that was wrong - he fights to oppose his own parent, Faker. Quinton was surprised at how strong Kite had become, and Kite told him he would inherit Quinton's feelings and settle things with Vetrix for him. Bringing out " Neo Galaxy-Eyes Photon Dragon " with the aide of a card Faker had give him, " Message in a Bottle ", Kite defeated Quinton. Quinton left through a portal, leaving "Dyson Sphere" behind for Kite and put his faith into him, saying that "Hart and Kite" will always be like little brothers to him. Returning home, he goes to  Trey 's bedside, where he falls comatose [2] , due to "Dyson Sphere" being such a powerful "Number" and his crest being tied to his soul. [12]  He was later seen sleeping in his own bed alongside his fallen brothers. Vetrix revealed to a being through a portal that despite Quinton and his brothers being defeated his plan was still going perfectly. [20] 
 
During Kite's Duel with Vetrix, he Summoned "Dyson Sphere" in an attempt to fulfill his promise to Quinton and nearly performed a OTK. Vetrix countered the move and destroyed "Dyson Sphere". [21]  As the Duel progressed Vetrix revealed to Kite that he merely exploited Quinton alongside his brothers,  Dextra  and Shark in order to bolster feelings of hatred to Summon " Number 69: Heraldry Crest ", claiming that he himself lacked emotion. [22]           Quinton along with his  family  departs.     After Vetrix was defeated by Yuma, he released the souls of those he had captured including those of his sons. Quinton and his brothers awoke afterwards. [23]  He, his brothers and his father watched part of the Duel between Yuma and Kite. Vetrix told them they would go home now and they departed through a portal. [24] 
 Yu-Gi-Oh! ZEXAL II 
 Mythyrian Numbers War 
         Quinton ordering  Trey  to look after Yuma.     
 Quinton and his brothers later returned to  Heartland  via submarine where they discussed the ongoing war between the  Astral World  and the  Barian World . Quinton noted that now that  Astral  was dead, the  Barians  were sure to make their move and assault  Yuma  in an attempt to steal his " Numbers ". Declaring it was time to make their move, he then entrusted  Trey  with the role of protecting Yuma. Trey later revealed that Quinton had invented a bracelet which granted him and his brothers the abilities of  Vetrix 's crest. [25] 
 
         Quinton tells Yuma that the trip to  Astral World  will be a one-way ticket.     
In an arctic area, Quinton worked together with  Kite  to build a  Interdimensional Teleporter  to go to the Astral World to find Astral. As they made progress, Quinton thanked Kite for his efforts and told him that the experiment was extremely dangerous and they could not let Yuma be aware of it. Eventually, Quinton found out that Kite went against his wishes and brought Yuma to their laboratory. He sternly questioned Kite, who said that he wouldn't "coddle" Yuma like him. He also argued with Yuma about the unknown dangers about traveling through different dimensions and warned him that he could die. At everyone's behest, Quinton gave in and prepared to send Yuma to Astral World. As they activated the device, Quinton explained that Yuma wouldn't be able to return after he goes through the gate and that he must stay absolutely still during the charging period.         Scritch vs. Kite and Quinton      After  Scritch  caused a blackout, Quinton and Kite challenged him to a Duel to protect Yuma, who returned " Number 9: Dyson Sphere " to Quinton. [9]  When Kite began to hallucinate that Quinton was Scritch, Quinton was forced to Duel against him. Quinton used "Dyson Sphere" to  attack  " Galaxy-Eyes Photon Dragon ", recreating an old training experiment they underwent to awaken Kite's survival instincts and successfully made Kite fight the poison off. Together they powered up "Galaxy-Eyes" and won the Duel. Afterwards, the device was activated successfully and Quinton bid Yuma farewell as he was sent to the Astral World. [14] 
 After Yuma left, Quinton and the others stayed behind to keep an eye on the portal [26] [26] , but Orbital suddenly told them that the portal was excluding large amounts of energy. This caused Quinton to worry about the portal breaking down and Yuma being stuck in the Astral World. [27]  As the energy continued to overload the device, Quinton and the others were forced to evacuated the laboratory before it exploded. [28] 
 He returned to Heartland and met up with his brothers and Yuma's friends to tell them what what happened with Yuma.  Mr. Heartland  appeared before them and revealed that the human world and the Barian World were fusing together. As he watched Kite Duel against Mr. Heartland, he became concerned for his former pupil as Kite was too injured to continued the Duel. [29]  Once Yuma and Astral returned, Quinton was happy to see him and tended to Kite as Yuma took his place in the Duel. Afterwards, he warmly congratulated Yuma on his victory, but their situation turned more dire as Quinton and the others saw the large pillar of energy glowing even brighter. [30] 
 
 Barian Emperor Onslaught 
         Quinton gives  Quattro  " Rank-Up-Magic Argent Chaos Force ".     
 Quinton was stunned when the  Seven Barian Emperors  appeared before them, along with  Shark  and  Rio  as Nash and Marin. After the  Emperor's Key  and Nash's  Barian Emblem  reacted and knocked Yuma unconscious, Quinton and the group fled with help from  Roku  and  Kaze . He drove his family's armored vehicle as Yuma's friends were coming to their aid. When Nash intercepted them, Quinton expressed his concerns about  Quattro  Dueling Nash since his brother considered Shark a friend. However, Quattro insisted and Quinton gave his new creation and the trump card of humanity, " Rank-Up-Magic Argent Chaos Force ", and then drove away before the Duel began. [31] 
 
As Quattro and Nash continued their Duel, Quinton drove the car whilst checking on the progress of the Duel from the windows, becoming concern when he saw the pillars of light from the  Chaos Draw . Unfortunately, the allies that were to stall for Quinton as he drove Yuma to safety ended up defeated, leaving his younger brother the only Duelist left. [32]  When Trey was checking on their brother's signal, Quinton told him they they can only trust him to come back to them with Shark. When Quattro was defeated, Quinton noticed Trey's bracelet saying "lost" and stopped the car as Yuma and Kite finally woke up. Yuma grieved for his lost friends and argued with Kite about Shark. Quinton advised Yuma not to give up or his brother "Thomas" would have died in vain. After Yuma and Astral made plans to travel to the  Barian World  to confront  Don Thousand  and Kite left with Orbital 7, Quinton's and Trey's bracelets started to glow, which signaled that the Barians were close by.          Mizar  confronts  Trey  and Quinton.      They told Yuma that they could not go with him, insisting they take revenge on the Barians for Quattro's death. Yuma urged them not to focus on revenge since they should know better than anyone that revenge will only cause them pain, but Trey claimed he couldn't stand Yuma any longer as Quinton stood quietly beside him. After Trey gave Yuma a bitter parting, Quinton and Trey drove off in their van to a bridge and shared a meal of Duel rice that Tori made. Quinton apologized to his little brother for the situation, saying that Trey shouldn't have had to say good-bye to Yuma that way, but Trey said there was no other way - if Yuma hadn't left when he did, he would have fought the Barians. Knowing only Yuma and Astral could end the fight, they had to remain behind as bait. They were quickly confronted by  Mizar , who demanded where Yuma and Astral were. The Arclights refused to tell him where they were. Putting their full trust in Yuma, Quinton and Trey prepared Duel for their lives, proclaiming that Thomas was waiting for them in Hell. [33] 
 Quinton informed Mizar that he was the one who had taught Kite how to Duel, which seemed to intrigue Mizar. The Duel began and Quinton quickly brought out " Number 9: Dyson Sphere ". The monster's size alerted  Dumon  and  Marin  to the Duel's start and they quickly joined Mizar, who told them he was fine and that they should search for Yuma and Astral. Quinton and Trey used the power of their bracelets' crests to generate a  Sphere Field , trapping the three Barians. The Duel continued, but in reality, "Dyson Sphere" was only bait that Mizar took, destroying it with his " Number 107: Galaxy-Eyes Tachyon Dragon ". Due to Mizar's use of " Tachyon Flare Wing ", the duo were able to outwit him and  equip  "Tachyon Dragon" to Trey's " Number C6: Chronomaly Chaos Atlandis ", created using "Argent Chaos Force". Mizar then angrily drew " Rank-Up-Magic - The Seventh One " with Chaos Draw], but realized he couldn't play it as "Tachyon Dragon" was not on his field or his Graveyard or  Extra Deck , just as the Arclights had planned. [34]  Admitting he had underestimated them, Mizar played defensively using " Heliosphere Dragon " and two  Trap Cards . This was enough to survive Quinton's combo of "Chaos Atlandis" and " Number C9: Chaos Dyson Sphere ", though his  Life Points  remained at only 1. Mizar also recovered "Tachyon Dragon" this way, enabling him to Summon " Number C107: Neo Galaxy-Eyes Tachyon Dragon ". The brothers attempted a counter with " Monopole Chain " and " Atlandis Invitation ", but the effect of "Neo Tachyon" rewound time and rendered them useless. Seeing there was no way out, Quinton activated a communications link with Yuma and told both him and Mizar where Kite had gone. He had discovered  tablet detailing a legend  regarding the "Galaxy-Eyes" dragons. Believing them connected to the  Numeron Code , he journeyed to the moon. Quinton told Yuma to remember the end of this Duel as a warning at how powerful the Seven Barian Emperors could be. Mizar ordered his attacks, defeating the brothers and sending them to the Barian World, while saying "farewell, proud brothers." As they were defeated, they told Yuma they'd always be with him in spirit. [13] 
 Quinton was revived after Nash was defeated by Yuma, appearing in the same spot where he and Trey were defeated by Mizar. He and his brothers watched the Duel between Yuma and Astral from the top of a skyscraper building looking down. While Dextra and Nistro watched more from behind Astral's side,  Nelson ,  Anna ,  Cathy ,  Caswell ,  Flip ,  Bronk , and  Tori  watched the Duel from Yuma's side. [35]  As Yuma and Astral were in the beginning stages of the Duel, Quinton and his brothers looked back and forth between the moon and the Duel area, speculating about the Numeron Code and what would happened to it after the outcome of the Duel. While his brothers continued watching, Quinton made a silent wish while looking toward the moon. He hoped that with the power of the Numeron Code, that the one soul that had not returned would be able to. That soul was Kite. After Yuma won the Duel, Quinton continued working together with his father, Kite, Orbital 7, and Dr. Faker in continuing their work researching parallel universes. Upon hearing about the Astral World's crisis, he joined his family, Yuma, Tori, Kite, Orbital 7 and The Seven Barian Emperors on the journey there. [36] 
 
 Deck 
 Quinton uses a  Space Deck , primarily focused on dealing huge amounts of  Effect damage , punishing opponent's aggressive strategies with cards such as " Infernal Sun ", " Neverending Nightmare ", " Malevolent Flash " and  Xyz Summoning  " Number 9: Dyson Sphere ". Given its hard-to-access  Rank , Quinton uses cards such as " Deep-Space Cruiser IX ", " Tannhauser Gate " and  "Hologram Projection " to easily acquire appropriate  Overlay Units  for it. During his Duel with  Mizar , Quinton incorporates " Rank-Up-Magic Argent Chaos Force " into his Deck, giving him access to " Number C9: Chaos Dyson Sphere ". In order to counter the new-found power of the  Barian Emperors  (" Rank-Up-Magic - The Seventh One "), he includes " Spell Summon Stopper ".
