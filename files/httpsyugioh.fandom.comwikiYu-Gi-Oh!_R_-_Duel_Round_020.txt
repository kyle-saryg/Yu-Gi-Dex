 The Truth of the R.A. Project!! 
 
 "The Rage of Kaiba!!" , known as  "Seto Kaiba Furious!"  in the Japanese version, is the twentieth chapter of the  Yu-Gi-Oh! R  manga. It was first printed in Japan on November 20, 2005 in  V Jump  magazine. It was later reprinted in volume 3 of Yu-Gi-Oh! R.
 Jonouchi  defeats  Reiko  and  Kaiba  reaches  Yako .
 
 Featured Duel: Katsuya Jonouchi vs. Reiko Kitamori 
 Duel continues from  the previous chapter . 
 Turn 8: Reiko 
As she  attacked ,  Reiko  must  send  the top ten cards of her  Deck  to the  Graveyard  due to her two " Battlefield Tragedies ".
 Turn 9: Jonouchi 
 Jonouchi   Sets  a card.
 Turn 10: Reiko 
Reiko  Tributes  " Puppet Queen " to  Normal Summon  " Puppet King " (2800/2600) in  Attack Position , whose  effect  treats "Puppet Queen" as two Tributes. Jonouchi  activates  his  face-down  " Polymerization ", fusing " Gearfried the Iron Knight " with " Giltia the D. Knight " to  Fusion Summon  " Gilti-Gearfried the Magical Steel Knight " (2700/1600) in Attack Position. "Puppet King"  attacks  "Gilti-Gearfried", but Jonouchi activates his face-down " Extra Boost ", increasing the  ATK  of "Gilti-Gearfried" by half its  DEF , though it will be  sent  to the Graveyard at the  End Phase . Its ATK becomes 3500, so "Puppet King" is destroyed (Reiko 4000 → 3300). Reiko activates her face-down " Rope of Life ", which would Special Summon "Puppet King" with its ATK increased by 800. Jonouchi activates his face-down " Relentless Attacks ", letting his  monster  immediately declare a  direct attack  even though it is Reiko's  turn  (Reiko 3300 → 0).
