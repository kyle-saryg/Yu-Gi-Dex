 Rules 
 Each player begins with 8000 LP. 
 LP can be gained through the effects of some cards, such as " Solemn Wishes ". 
 LP can be lost by:
 Damage : Whenever a player takes damage, they lose LP equal to the amount of damage dealt. There are two main forms of damage:
 Battle damage : When monsters  battle , their stats are compared. If the monster is in  Attack Position , their  ATK  value is used; if the monster is in  Defense Position , their  DEF  value is used. If the defending monster is in Attack Position and its ATK is lower, the defending player takes damage equal to the difference. If the defending monster is in Defense Position, the defending player does not take any damage, unless the opponent's monster has an effect to inflict  piercing  battle damage. If the attacking monster's ATK is lower than the appropriate value of the defending monster, the attacking player loses LP equal to the difference instead. A monster can also attack a player  directly ; in that case, the attacking monster's full  ATK  value is inflicted as damage to the player. 
 Effect damage : The effects of some cards, such as " Ookazi ", directly damage a player's LP. 
 Cost : Cards such as " Seven Tools of the Bandit " require the player to pay LP in order to  activate  them. This is not considered to be damage, as the card text does not use the word "damage". 
 Effects: A few cards, such as " Message in a Bottle " and " Soul Charge ", directly state that a player "loses LP". This is neither considered to be damage nor payment. Effects like these are usually  drawbacks  to otherwise powerful effects to prevent the player from using cards that mitigate costs (such as " Spell Economics ") or prevent damage (such as " Rainbow Life ") to avoid the drawback. 
 If a player's LP reaches zero, they  lose  the  Duel . If a player's LP would drop below 0, they become 0 rather than negative. 
 Other games 
 In manga and anime, in the  Duel Monsters  Basic rules (prior to the  Battle City  tournament), players play with 2000 LP. In all other forms of  Duel Monsters  from Battle City onward, players start with 4000 LP in both the manga and anime. 
 Some video games allow players to set the number of LP they begin with, in some cases up to 16000. 
 In  Yu-Gi-Oh! BAM , players begin with a number of   LP equal to the combined Life Point score of the  Monster Cards  in their Deck. 
 In the anime and  Yu-Gi-Oh! Tag Force  games, some effects allow players to  continue playing  while they have 0 LP, such as " Relay Soul ", " Infernity Zero ", and " Divine Serpent Geh ". 
 In  Dungeon Dice Monsters , each player's Dungeon Master has 3 LP. Each time it gets attacked, it loses 1 Life Point. A player loses when their Dungeon Master loses all of its LP. These are renamed Heart Points in the anime. 
 Trivia 
 Charlie McCay , from the  Yu-Gi-Oh! ZEXAL  anime, was the first Duelist to ever have a 6-digit LP score in the anime or manga, at 100,000. 
 Don Thousand , also from the  Yu-Gi-Oh! ZEXAL  anime, currently holds the record for the highest LP score seen in the anime or manga, at 102,900. 
 Although Life Points was shortened to "LP", the English dub still has characters refer to them as Life Points. 
 Gauges 
 The following  gauges  are displayed to keep track of LP in the anime.
