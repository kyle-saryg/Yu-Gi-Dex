 The creators of the anime do not know how to duel. They screwed the rules many times to attempt to make the plot run better. This is not the only error, there are plenty. 
 Do not follow the anime when playing the  OCG / TCG .  - Falzar FZ - ( talk page | useful stuff )  06:10, July 23, 2012 (UTC) 
 There are many errors in the anime, however, that "Error" is not an error. The card  Spell Sanctuary  was face-up during the entire duel, making that possible. Quick Ninja  ( talk  •  contribs ) 10:48, December 3, 2012 (UTC)
 During the summoning of No.C96 Dark Storm, Dark Mist's astral form says that he discards Magical Stone Excavation via Chaos Return to activate Barian's Force from the grave, but he says マジック・カード (Majikku Kādo) instead of 魔法カード (Mahō kādo). this means that in the zexal anime there are called with a different name? -- XBrain130™ 「

 Magic/Spell 
 Can Magic Cards still be played in-game, or must they be designated Spell cards? Cause I was once told you couldn't use cards that were still called Magic Cards, so I went looking for the ruling that said so. But I don't rightly know where to look for it.

 I think  this  is relevant. You can use cards with old wording, but it is recommended you use cards with the latest errata because that is the text you will need to follow regardless. -- Snorlax Monster  03:19, April 12, 2014 (UTC)
