 Is there any changes in the storyline?-- 76.27.8.201  ( talk ) 05:14, September 28, 2010 (UTC)
 
 I don't know for sure, but I think only some images and texts were improved, no major changes. See this paragraph about the series: 
 "(...) The bunkoban is a reprint of the entire series condensed into 22 volumes total; each volume included a brand-new cover design and a tarot card from one of the major arcana. The bunkoban also included some revised text and edited panels."  LegenaryAsariUgetsu  ( talk  •  contribs ) January 7th, 2012, 01:21 (UTC)
 
 Next Volumes 
 All the 22 volumes were already released, but the list still counts up only to vol. 10. This should be updated, but I don't know how to add other volumes on this page :/.
