 Kisara  (キサラ  Kisara ) is a character in the  Yu-Gi-Oh!  manga . This is the original depiction of  Kisara , as created by  Kazuki Takahashi . She wields  The White Dragon , which is her  ka  AND her  ba , which can only be let out when she is unconscious, due to the fact that the White Dragon is actually possessing her.
 
 Biography 
 Seto  stumbles across Kisara being stoned because of her pale white skin, deep blue eyes and snow white hair.  Shada  senses the immeasurably strong strength and power within her—which he deems "equal to that of the Egyptian gods". Seto takes her back to the palace, where he imprisons her, to study and obtain her ka,  The White Dragon .  Gebelk  forces her to fight against two prisoners in a ka battle to strengthen her ka. However, she doesn't know her ka exists, so she was about to die, until Seto saves her. She was then unconscious, and because of that, the White Dragon came out, killing the prisoners.
 After  Akhenaden  pledges his loyalty to  Zorc Necrophades , he kidnaps Priest Seto - revealed to be his son - and tries to brainwash him into usurping Pharaoh  Atem . Instead, Seto freed her, and told her to flee. However, when she was trying to flee, Akhenaden killed her. When Akhenaden took over Seto's mind, she uses her spirit dragon to destroy Akhenaden and free Seto from his mind-control. She then pledges to serve him in this form, making him the new keeper of the Blue-Eyes White Dragon. 
Takahashi has stated that he originally planned for the story to have further explored the relationship between Seto and Kisara (including a subplot where Seto rebels against the pharaoh to avenge Kisara's death), but in order to meet a deadline these details had to be cut. According to Takahashi, Seto's feelings for Kisara are the basis of Kaiba's modern-day obsession with the "Blue-Eyes White Dragon." 
 After her death, Seto holds Kisara's lifeless body in front of the tablet - notably, this is the vivid vision Kaiba constantly sees during his battle with  Ishizu  in  Battle City .
