 When  Katsuya Jonouchi  was hurriedly cycling to school, he bumped into the policeman, knocking him over. The policeman angrily asked Jonouchi if he knew the speed limit, to which Jonouchi replied that he was going too fast to see it. When Jonouchi was sent to an alternate dimension constructed from his memories, Jonouchi passed the policeman, who was oblivious to Jonouchi's existence. [3]
