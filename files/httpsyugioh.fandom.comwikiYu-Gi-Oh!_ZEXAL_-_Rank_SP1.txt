 Summary 
 Kaito Tenjo , a  Numbers Hunter ,  steals  a person's soul after defeating him in a  Duel . However, he gets frustrated since he has no " Numbers ".
 Meanwhile,  Yuma Tsukumo  sees a demonic  door  in a dream, and wakes up. In the next day, he meets  Kotori  and  Tetsuo  at school. Later, Yuma and Tetsuo Duel, but apparently Tetsuo defeats Yuma with ease.
 At night, Tetsuo searches for Yuma, as he forgot his  pendant , which calls Kaito's attention, who was nearby. 
 When Yuma and Kotori find them, Tetsuo is down in the ground, soulless, and Kaito is standing in front of him. In order to retrieve Tetsuo's soul, Yuma is forced to Duel Kaito. 
 Kaito quickly Summons a high- Level  monster and makes Yuma defenseless, but The Door appeared before Yuma and told Yuma to open it and he will gain new strength in return. Yuma does so and  Astral  appears before him and tells Yuma to active " Monster Reborn " and bring back " Ganbara Knight ", then  Overlay  the two Level 4 monsters to Summon " Number 39: Utopia ". When "Utopia" appears, it causes Kaito's  D-Pad  to malfunction and he retreats, giving Tetsuo's soul back. Afterwards Astral introduces himself and asks Yuma to fight alongside him and save the  Astral World .
