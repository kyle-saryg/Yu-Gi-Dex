 Face-down   ( 裏 側 表 示   Uragawa Hyōji ) is a  position  in which a card's  backing  is visible; as the term "face-down" suggests, the card's face is placed against the playing surface, preventing it from being seen. This is the opposite of  face-up .
 Face-down cards have no properties (name,  Attribute ,  Type ,  Level / Rank ,  ATK ,  DEF ,  effect ) until they are changed to face-up. A face-down card being  looked  at or  revealed  is still considered face-down (although its properties can be determined by card effects while being revealed) and is returned to its original position once the player(s) have finished viewing it.
 In  Yu-Gi-Oh! ARC-V , small orbs with glowing red eyes appear on top of face-down monsters.

 In the Decks 
 Each player's  Main  and  Extra Deck  is placed face-down in their respective  zone  at the start of each game. Cards in the Main deck are always face-down,  unless stated otherwise 
 Face-down cards in the Extra Deck can be looked at by their  possessor  at any time, but cannot be looked at by their opponent.

 Extra Deck  Pendulum Monsters ( Fusion ,  Synchro ,  Xyz/Pendulum ) can be summoned by its own mechanic only while face-down in the Extra Deck, and cannot be Pendulum Summoned.
 
 On the field 
 During a game, cards are normally placed face-down by  Setting  them. Face-down cards on the field can be looked at by their  controller  at any time, but cannot be looked at by their opponent, unless stated otherwise.
 Face-down cards on the field can be flipped face-up. ( Flip Summon  for monster and  Activation  for Spell/Trap cards, in general cases) However, face-up cards cannot be  Flipped  face-down, unless an effect specifically states so.

 Monster Cards can be placed on the field in face-down  Defense Position , generally by  Normal Set  (it is not possible for monsters to be in face-down Attack Position, post errata of " Darkness Approaches "). Some effects may  Special Summon face-down , but only if a card states explicitly that it can do so. In some video games, card effects that Special Summon multiple monsters face-down also  shuffle them  on the same side of the field.
 Face-down  Monster Cards  cannot be  equipped  with  Equip Cards ; if a monster equipped with an Equip Card(s) is flipped face-down, the Equip Card(s) equipped to that flipped monster is  destroyed .
