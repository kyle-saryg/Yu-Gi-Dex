 Chazz vs. Syrus!! 
 
 "Alexis vs. David!!" , known as  "Asuka vs. Rabb!!"  in the Japanese version, is the twenty-fourth chapter of the  Yu-Gi-Oh! GX  manga . It was first printed in Japanese in  V Jump  magazine and in English in  Shonen Jump  magazine. Both of which were printed in  volume 3  of the  Yu-Gi-Oh! GX  graphic novels afterwards.
 
 Summary 
 Jaden Yuki  is relieved at  Reggie MacKenzie 's defeat, as he won't need to face her in a  Shadow Game , but realizes that he still may end up dueling  David Rabb . David is surprised that Reggie lost, and she responds that everyone has a bad day sometimes. She warns him to be careful during his duel with  Alexis Rhodes , and to work hard to get his payback. He asks what she means, and she simply says he couldn't afford to lose to "his little sister" as well, implying the  Atticus Rhodes  had defeated David in the past.
 Bastion Misawa  is cheered as he leaves the arena, and Alexis congratulates him on his victory in the hallway, and vows to defeat David. Alexis goes first, and  draws  " Ice Master ". She's pleased to see she has the necessary cards in her  hand  to quickly Summon it. She  Normal Summons  " Cold Enchanter " in  Attack Position  and  Sets  two cards. David seems pleased with his own hand, and draws " The Big Saturn ".  Syrus Truesdale  warns Jaden that David had asked him about  card spirits  previously, and urges him to be careful, which makes Jaden even more worried. David  activates  " Replacement Parts ",  sending  a  Machine - Type   monster  in his hand to the  Graveyard  to add  Level  4 or lower Machine-Type one from his  Deck  to his hand. He then Normal Summons " Pandora ". He then plays " Prototype Development ", which lets him  Tribute  "Pandora" to  Special Summon  a Machine-Type monster from his Graveyard. He Summons "The Big Saturn" in Attack Position.  Chancellor Sheppard  is glad to get confirmation of what  Zane Truesdale  told him earlier - the American students possess cards from the " Legendary Planets " series. Reggie comments that she may have motivated David to much.
 David attacks with "Saturn" and Alexis activates her  face-down  " Blizzard Wall ", switching "Cold Enchanter" to  Defense Position . David activates the  Quick-Play Spell Card  " Aftershock ", which will grant his Machine-Types the  piercing  ability for the remainder of the turn. Alexis takes 1600 damage and "Cold Enchanter" is  destroyed . This lets her activate the other effect of "Blizzard Wall" - "Saturn" now gains an  Ice Counter . Alexis wasn't expecting such a powerful monster so early on, but has " Absolute Zero Barrier " in her hand, so she's confident she can stall on her next few turns. Alexis' other Set card, " Doble Passe " appears to have activated on its own, and David explains that he played " Forced Activation ", which activated her card via its effect. He activates " Ignition ", which changes the effect of "Doble Passe" "destroy one monster on the  field . "Saturn" is destroyed, and its effect activates, causing both players to take damage equal to its  ATK  Alexis takes 2800 damage, reducing her to zero  Life Points , but David survives with 1200. Thus, David has performed a  One Turn Kill . Alexis is shocked and falls to her knees, while David hopes that when he and Jaden Duel, he'll be able to take both " Winged Kuriboh " and " Elemental Hero Terra Firma " from him.
