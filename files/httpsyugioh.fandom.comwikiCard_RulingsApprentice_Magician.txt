 OCG Rulings 
 If " Pitch-Black Power Stone " is negated by " Royal Decree ", then " Pitch-Black Power Stone " will remain on the field meaninglessly.  When " Royal Decree " is removed from the field, the effect of " Pitch-Black Power Stone " is reapplied, so you can put Spell Counters on " Pitch-Black Power Stone " by " Apprentice Magician " etc. [1] 
 Previously Official Rulings 
   These TCG rulings were issued by  Upper Deck Entertainment  and have since been deemed unofficial by Konami. [3]  They were previously considered official and can still be correct, as long as they follow the official gameplay rules, or unless Konami has issued a ruling that says otherwise. References:  [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] 
 
 If you  Special Summon  " Apprentice Magician "  face-down  (such as with " Apprentice Magician ’s” effect) then you do not place a  Spell Counter . 
 “ Apprentice Magician ’s” effect activates at the same time as when monsters are sent to the  Graveyard . But it does not have to be sent to the  Graveyard ; you get to  Special Summon  a new monster when " Apprentice Magician " is destroyed as a result of battle, even if " Banisher of the Light " is in play. [2] 
 If you take control of your opponent's " Apprentice Magician ", and it is  destroyed  as a result of battle, then your opponent (the original  owner ) will get to  Special Summon . Because “ Apprentice Magician ” is no longer on your side of the field, it is now in the opponent’s  Graveyard  (or  removed from play  area). 
 You must show your opponent the monster you  Special Summon . 
 For effects that place a  Spell Counter , you can  chain  to the activation of those effects. The  Spell Counter  is actually placed when the effect  resolves . 
 Mentions in Other Rulings 
 Dark Valkyria : While " Dark Valkyria " is an Effect Monster, you can place  Spell Counters  onto it with other card effects, like ... " Apprentice Magician ." 
 Pitch-Black Power Stone : "Pitch-Black Power Stone" may itself receive additional  Spell Counters  from effects such as " Apprentice Magician ". 
 Tower of Babel : You can move Spell Counters to " Tower of Babel " with " Pitch-Black Power Stone ", but if the 4th  Spell Counter  is placed on " Tower of Babel " with..." Apprentice Magician ", " Tower of Babel " is destroyed but no  damage  is inflicted. 
 Storm Caller : If a  Psychic - Type  monster destroys your opponent's " Apprentice Magician " by battle, if you return it to the top of your opponent's Deck its effect does not activate. 
 Judge List Rulings 
 If " Apprentice Magician " is destroyed by battle and sent to the Graveyard while " The End of Anubis " is face-up on the field, then " Apprentice Magician 's" effect will be negated. [2]
