 The  Friendship Cup  is a tournament held in the  Synchro Dimension  in the  Yu-Gi-Oh! ARC-V  anime. The tournament made  Jack Atlas  the current  Duel King . [1]  It was created to promote harmony between the  Topsiders  and  Commons  after the Commons revolted when  Chojiro Tokumatsu  was arrested. [2] 
 There is a large amount of controversy regarding the motives of the tournament, due to Jack being perceived as a traitor by many of the Commons, a hero by the other part, and the Tops consider him to be one of them. According to  Yugo  the purpose of the event is deciding who is worthy of challenging Jack to a Duel. Every year a participant is picked for an exhibition match, which in reality is meant to show the rest Jack's overwhelming strength, so Jack's opponent is called "The King's sacrifice". [3] 
 There is a horrible conspiracy behind the tournament where losers are taken to an  Underground Labor Facility  and forced into servitude (though once there they can win their freedom by Dueling). [4]  However, the people of  New Domino City  don't seem to find anything wrong with this as it's "natural" for the defeated to fall. [5]  They even forced the Lancers (who aren't native to their dimension) to go there.
 With  Yuya 's victory, Topsiders and Commons were abolished. [6]  This means that the Friendship Cup has outlived its usage, so it's dubious that it will be held again in the future.

 Tournament 
       The match-ups for the second half of the first round.     
       Yuya wins the Friendship Cup.     
 The Friendship Cup is conducted as a 16-player knock-out tournament. The participants are locked in a building owned by the  High Council  to keep  Jean-Michel Roget  and  Sector Security  from interfering. Matchups are revealed on the spot, with the chosen Duelists being released at that moment and led to the  Duel Palace . The losers, however, are forced to leave the building.
 After the Duel between  Shay Obsidian  and  Dennis McField  destroyed much of the stadium's Duel Lanes, the tournament was forced to be held in New Domino City proper, with it being broadcasted to the audience in the stadium. [22]
