 Fusion Materials  (Japanese:  融 合 素 材   Yūgō Sozai ), formerly referred to as  Fusion-Material Monsters [1]  and then  Fusion Material Monsters , are  monsters  that are used for the  Fusion Summon  of a  Fusion Monster . Fusion Materials are listed on the first line of the Fusion Monster's  card text .

 Listing 
 While Fusion Materials can be specifically named monsters, they can also be more general. For example, " Five-Headed Dragon " simply requires 5  Dragon - Type  monsters, and " Chimeratech Overdragon " requires 1 " Cyber Dragon " and 1 or more  Machine -Type monsters.
 Listed Fusion Materials are monsters specifically named on a Fusion Monster as materials; cards that specify listed Fusion Materials, such as " Centrifugal Field ", cannot affect Fusion Monsters that do not specifically name Fusion Materials, such as "Five-Headed Dragon".
 
 Usage 
 Fusion Materials can be used even if the Summon is not a  Fusion Summon . Cards in the  Hex-Sealed Fusion   series   Tribute  themselves and the other necessary Fusion Materials specified on a Fusion Monster to Special Summon it, but this Special Summon is not treated as a Fusion Summon.  Contact Fusion  is also a type of Special Summon that uses Fusion Materials to Summon a Fusion Monster, but is not a Fusion Summon.
 Face-down  monsters on the field can be used as Fusion Materials, as long as they are controlled by the player performing the Fusion Summon and the card performing the Summon allows it. [2] 
 Fusion Substitute Monsters  such as " King of the Swamp " can replace one named Fusion Material. If a Fusion Substitute Monster is used, all other Fusion Materials used in the Fusion Summon must be correct. However, monsters whose name is being treated as a listed Fusion Material (e.g. " Elemental HERO Prisma ") are treated as correct and not as Fusion Substitute Monsters. Fusion Substitute Monsters can only replace specifically named Fusion Materials; as such, a Fusion Substitute Monster cannot be used in the Fusion Summon of " Evil HERO Dark Gaia " as it does not name any monsters, and can only replace " UFOroid " in the Fusion Summon of " UFOroid Fighter ".
 There are also several monsters which  cannot be used as a Fusion Material .
