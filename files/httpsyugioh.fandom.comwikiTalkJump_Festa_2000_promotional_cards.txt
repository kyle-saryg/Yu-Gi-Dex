 this isn't the 1999 Jump festa, but is the 2000 Jump Festa. all the Jump Festa are organized on december of the previous year. also this page needs a clean.. someone's interested? //////||||||\\\\\\  Jump Enemy  ( talk  •  contribs ) 14:35, October 24, 2010 (UTC)
 Are you sure? Cause it mentions only 1999. PoirotH  ( talk  •  contribs ) 15:41, October 24, 2010 (UTC)
 i am quite sure, some sites report it is the 1999 Jump Festa and others report it is the 2000 one. but all the Jump Festa are organized on december of the previous year, JF07: 12\16\2006 JF08: 12\23\2007 JF09: 12\22\2008 and i know the 2001 Jump Festa was held on december 2000....  so it should be 2000. //////|||||\\\\\\  Jump Enemy  ( talk  •  contribs ) 17:30, October 24, 2010 (UTC)
 
 The official database names this as "V Jump Festa 1999 promotion card" (Vジャンプフェスタ 1999 プロモーションカード) with a release date of October 21, 1999; see  [1]  and  [2] .  「 ディノ 奴 千？！ 」 ?  ·  ☎ Dinoguy1000  13:21, March 12, 2015 (UTC) 
 it may sound odd, but sometimes i trust more unofficial sources that official ones. the Jump Festa was held on december 1999 for the first time, and it was called  Jump Festa 2000 (wikipedia) ; so there has never been an event called Jump Festa 1999, this seems a common error to me, just because the event took place in 1999. knowing the web, i often see that a source is directly copied from another without being verified, and becomes known with a wrong name over the right one, it happens everyday even on famous newpapers; that's what happened in this case i guess (just try search in japanese: "ジャンプフェスタ 1999", ALL results are about yugioh only, specifically about the SCR BEWD). talking about the date, october 21, the event started on december 18... i dont know what that date should represent, maybe an invitation event or the advertising of the future lottery? 
 i have checked a little and some other japanese sites report the JF 1999 (2000) to having been held on October 21, in my opinion this is definetely wrong.   /////||||||\\\\\  Jump Enemy  ( talk  •  contribs ) 14:26, March 13, 2015 (UTC) 
 You would think that Konami and Shueisha would be able to keep dates straight when it comes to their own events, but I agree, there's definitely something weird going on here. When this article gets updated to the new format, it'll need a section discussing this, and redirects from the titles "Jump Festa 1999" and "V Jump Festa 1999" should be added, if they don't already exist.  「 ディノ 奴 千？！ 」 ?  ·  ☎ Dinoguy1000  14:34, March 13, 2015 (UTC)
