 Trivia 
 Despite there being 3 copies of " Lucky Chance " in this Deck, that card is ultimately useless here, since it only works with monster effects that require only 1 coin toss. The only monsters in this Deck whose effects involve a coin toss are " Gambler of Legend " and " Sand Gambler ", both of which require 3 coin tosses for their effects. 
 Several seemingly "out-of-place" cards are included in this Deck for references:
 " Taunt " is likely included in this Deck because its  Japanese artwork  features two men with  pompadours , a niche hairstyle that this character also sports. 
 " Shapesnatch " and " Magical Hats " (the latter having a Japanese name that translates to "Magical Silk Hat") are likely included in this Deck for their feelings of "dapperness" that they evoke, which this character also evokes in the  anime . 
 " Noisy Gnat " is likely included in this Deck as a reference to this character's personality, since that card's Japanese name translates to "Rambunctious Insect". 
 " Fiend Comedian " is likely included in this Deck as a reference to how MCs ( masters of ceremonies ) have a role in comedy clubs.
