 Summary 
 Jack's Blunder 
 Since the announcement of the  World Racing Grand Prix , crimes involving Duel Runners have been rising throughout the city. Jack and  Carly  do some investigating one night and while waiting, they then witness a gang steal a number of Duel Runners and attempt to make their getaway. 
 Jack tries to stop them, but the gang members are not afraid and its leader,  Syd , tries to shoot him. However, one of the gang members shields Jack, resulting in him crashing and the rest of the gang fleeing. 
 Jack is also abruptly stopped and instead goes to where the gang member is. While trying to question him,  Trudge  appears shocked as he recognizes who the man is.   
 
         
 Later at the hospital, Trudge reveals that the injured man was actually an undercover  Sector Security  officer investigating the thieves named  Kaz . Thanks to Jack's interference, he is now in critical condition. 
 After hearing all of this, Jack takes a  card  from Kaz's  Deck  and decides to go after the thieves himself.
 
 
 Tracking The Thieves 
 In  Satellite , Jack meets an informant,  Gus , who tells him where the thieves' base is. However, it turns out to be a trap, as Jack is assaulted by a number of thugs and ends up in the hospital himself after being hit in the head with an iron rod. 
 His friends try to talk him out of it, but Jack states that finding these thieves is something that he has to do himself. 
 Jack confronts the thieves once again and is again beaten for his trouble. This time, however, he manages to plant a tracking device on one of them and finds their base at the city docks as they plan on leaving. 
 There, he confronts Syd and tells them that Security is on their way and that they cannot escape. Syd admits defeat and suggests that the two have a  Duel  while they wait for Security to come.
 
 Jack VS. Syd 
       Syd  and  Jack  on the conveyor belt.     
 Syd reveals a special set up for their Duel: Each participant is chained to a conveyor belt and as each player loses  Life Points , the conveyor belt moves backwards and upon defeat, they are dropped into a trash compactor. 
 Syd gets off to an early lead thanks to his the  piercing  effect of " Assault Wheel ", while Jack  summons  " Vice Dragon ", " Archfiend Interceptor " and " Multiple Piece Golem ". 
 However, Syd  activates  " Nightmare Wheel " to neutralize "Multiple Piece Golem" while inflicting  burn   damage  and then he activates " Plunder Decoy " to force "Vice Dragon" to  destroy  "Archfiend Interceptor".
 Syd then reveals that their base has actually set sail, as it is really a disguised tanker ship and that Security won't make it after all. He then  Synchro Summons  " Combat Wheel " and brings Jack to the edge of his conveyor belt. 
 However, Jack manages to Synchro Summon the monster card that he borrowed from Kaz, " Chaos King Archfiend " and thanks to its effect, it is able to destroy "Combat Wheel" and drain Syd's Life Points to 0. Jack saves Syd from being crushed in the compactor and then knocks him out with a single punch to the face.
 
 Case Closed 
         
 By the time Security finally arrives, Jack has already taken out the entire gang. Back at the hospital, Jack returns "Chaos King Archfiend" to the recovering Kaz and thanks him for his efforts. The two then agree to one day have a  Turbo Duel  together.
 
 
 Featured Duel: Jack Atlas vs. Syd 
 Turn 1: Jack 
 Jack  draws. He then  Normal Summons  " Mad Archfiend " ( 4/1800/0) in Attack Position and sets a card.
 Turn 2: Syd 
 Syd  draws " Assault Wheel " and subsequently Normal Summons it ( 4/2300/0) in Attack Position. "Assault Wheel" then attacks "Mad Archfiend". Due to the second effect of "Mad Archfiend", it is  switched  to  Defense Position . "Assault Wheel" then destroys "Mad Archfiend" and inflicts  piercing  damage to Jack (Jack 4000 → 1700). Since "Assault Wheel" attacked, its effect reduces its  ATK  to 0 until Syd's next  Standby Phase  ("Assault Wheel" 2300 → 0/0). Syd then  sets  two cards (" Nightmare Wheel " and "Plunder Decoy").
 Turn 3: Jack 
Jack draws "Vice Dragon". Since Syd controls monsters while Jack controls none, Jack  Special Summons  " Vice Dragon " in Attack Position by halving its original ATK and DEF ( 5/2000 → 1000/2400 → 1200). He then  activates  " Polymerization " to fuse " Big Piece Golem " with " Medium Piece Golem " in order to  Fusion Summon  " Multiple Piece Golem " ( 6/2600/1300) in Attack Position. Jack then  Normal Summons  " Archfiend Interceptor " ( 4/1400/1600) in Attack Position. Now when Syd declares an attack with a monster he controls, he will take 500 damage. 
 "Multiple Piece Golem" attacks "Assault Wheel", but Syd activates his face-down "Nightmare Wheel" to forbid "Multiple Piece Golem" from attacking or changing its  Battle Position . Also during each of Syd's Standby Phases, Jack will take 500 damage.
 "Vice Dragon" then attacks "Assault Wheel", but Syd activates his face-down " Plunder Decoy " to take control of "Archfiend Interceptor" A replay then occurs and Jack uses "Vice Dragon" to attack "Assault Wheel". The effect of "Archfiend Interceptor" activates (Jack 1700 → 1200). "Vice Dragon" then destroys "Assault Wheel" (Syd 4000 → 3000).
 Turn 4: Syd 
Syd  draws . On Syd's Standby Phase, the effect of "Nightmare Wheel" activates (Jack 1200 → 700). Syd then Normal Summons " Cannon Wheel " ( 2/500/700) in Attack Position. He then tunes "Archfiend Interceptor" with "Cannon Wheel" in order to  Synchro Summon  " Combat Wheel " ( 6/2500/1200) in Attack Position.  As "Cannon Wheel" was used for a  Synchro Summon , its effect activates, inflicting 500 damage to Jack (Jack 700 → 200). 
 "Combat Wheel" attacks "Vice Dragon", but Jack activates his face-down " Nightmare Archfiends " to  Tribute  "Vice Dragon" and Special Summon three " Nightmare Archfiend Tokens " ( 6/2000/2000 for all three) to Syd's side of the  field  in Attack Position. A replay occurs and Syd chooses not to attack. Syd then activates " Block Dugout ". While "Block Dugout" is on the field, Jack's monsters can't attack if their combined  Levels  are less than the combined  Levels  of all monsters Syd controls.
 Turn 5: Jack 
Jack draws " Sinister Sprocket " and subsequently Normal Summons it ( 1/400/0) in Attack Position. He then tunes "Multiple Piece Golem" with "Sinister Sprocket" in order to  Synchro Summon  " Chaos King Archfiend " ( 7/2600/2600) in Attack Position. [Notes 1]  Since "Multiple Piece Golem" has left the field, "Nightmare Wheel" is destroyed. Since "Sinister Sprocket" was sent to the Graveyard for the  Synchro Summon  of a DARK Synchro Monster, its effect activates, allowing Jack to destroy "Block Dugout". 
 "Chaos King Archfiend" attacks "Combat Wheel", but Syd activates the effect of "Combat Wheel" to discard " Urgent Tuning " and increase the  ATK  of "Combat Wheel" by half the total  ATK  of every other monster he controls ("Combat Wheel": 2500 → 5500/1200). Jack activates the effect of "Chaos King Archfiend" to swap the  ATK  and  DEF  of every monster Syd controls until the End Phase. ("Combat Wheel": 5500 → 1200/1200 → 5500). "Chaos King Archfiend" destroys "Combat Wheel" (Syd 3000 → 1600). 
 Since Syd used the effect of "Combat Wheel" in the turn it was destroyed, its secondary effect activates, destroying all other monsters he controls. Since the "Nightmare Archfiend Tokens" were destroyed, Syd takes 800 damage for each one destroyed (Syd 1600 → 0).
