 Summary 
 Dr. Crowler  congratulates  Zane  on his defeat of  Chazz , calling him the #1 ranked in practical skills. Chazz remains on the Duel field, so Crowler sends Zane back on the helicopter alone, recommending they let Chazz have time to himself. Chazz vows to himself that he will one day surpass the "Kaiser". The crowd is amazed that Chazz inflicted no damage, surprised at the strength of Zane. Seeing Chazz's face,  Alexis  is surprised that he would put that much emotion on the surface.  Bastion  realizes just how angry Chazz is at himself for losing.  Syrus  asks where  Jaden  got to, and they conclude he must be watching the Duel somewhere - he loves Dueling too much to miss this. At the  Abandoned Dorm ,  Midori  remains unconscious as Jaden stares down  Reggie ,  Winged Kuriboh  beside him. Reggie address them both, telling them she's been looking for Kuriboh for a while now. Its existence is the reason that Reggie's freedom was stolen by  him .
 
       Reggie  before  Tragoedia  enslaves her.     
         Principal MacKenzie  is possessed by Tragoedia.     
 Reggie remembers her childhood. She appeared to live happily with  her father . One day after school, she reveals to one of her friends that  Mr. Phoenix , a card designer, was to be at her house to unveil his new card designs to her father. Reggie goes home, and moves to enter her father's office, asking if  Aster 's father has arrived yet, as she's eager to see the new designs. When she enters, she sees a terrifying sight. A body lies on the floor, cards lying near it. A black shadow leaps from the body to her father sitting behind his Deck, entering through his mouth. Reggie questions what's going on, and what the shadow is doing to her father. She realizes that the body belongs to  Aster 's father. " The Big Saturn ", " The Splendid Venus " and " Elemental Hero Terra Firma " are visible on the ground, with  other cards  face-down. As Principal MacKenzie turns around to face her, she realizes that he is no longer her father. His eyes appear completely black. Tragoedia considers this to be the perfect situation. He can use his new vessel's daughter as a puppet to aide him in his search.
 Since that day, Reggie has been his puppet. She believes that that will end today, as  the other spirit card  appears capable of suppressing Tragoedia's power. What Tragoedia seeks is right in front of Reggie. If she obtains both spirit cards for herself, she believes she'll be able to take Tragoedia's power for herself and make him  her  puppet instead. She knows that do that, Jaden will become her next "human stepladder", just as Midori was before him. She pulls out a coin with  Duel Academy 's insignia on it and declares that if it lands on tails, she'll go first. The coin lands on heads, so Jaden will take the first move. She declares that the  Shadow Duel  will now begin. Jaden's  hand  contains " Elemental Hero Voltic ", " Voltic Spear ", " Late Hero ", " Polymerization ", " Miracle Fusion " and one unspecified card. He  Sets  "Late Hero",  Normal Summons  "Voltic" in  Attack Position  and  equips  it with "Voltic Spear", giving it an additional 1000  ATK . He ends his  turn  and Reggie draws. She Normal Summons " Tiny Angel " in  Defense Position  and Sets two cards. Jaden draws, declares "here goes nothing!" and  attacks  and  destroy  "Tiny Angel" with "Voltic". He then  activates  his  face-down  "Late Hero",  Special Summoning  " Elemental Hero Woodsman " from his  Deck  in Attack Position as an " Elemental Hero "  monster  destroyed a monster  by battle . "Woodsman" attacks  directly , but Reggie activates her face-down " Sacred Revelation "  negating  the attack by  sending  two  Level  1 " Divine Spirit Parmals " from her Deck to the  Graveyard . Jaden ends his turn.
 Reggie Normal Summons " Iofiel " in Attack Position, whose  effect  activate, sending the Level 1 " Zeriel " from her Deck to the Graveyard to increase the ATK of "Iofiel" by 1000. "Iofiel" attacks and destroys "Woodsman", dealing 1000 damage to Jaden. She declares that his  Life Points  aren't the only thing depleting as his elbow appears to vanish. Reggie Sets a card to end her turn and Jaden questions if this is the kind of Duel Midori was in. Jaden draws and Normal Summons " Elemental Hero Ocean ". He then activates "Miracle Fusion",  removing  "Ocean" and the "Woodsman" in his Graveyard from play to  Fusion Summon  "Elemental Hero Terra Firma" in Attack Position. Jaden declares that he'll reduce Reggie's Life Points in one turn, and activates the effect of "Terra Firma",  Tributing  "Voltic" to increase the ATK of "Terra Firma" by that of "Voltic", giving it 3500 ATK. Reggie chides Jaden on being impatient.

 Errors 
 When " Elemental Hero Terra Firma " absorbs " Elemental Hero Voltic ", its  ATK  increases by the original ATK of "Voltic", which is 1000, becoming 3500. However, Voltic was  equipped  with " Voltic Spear ", which left its ATK 2000. Hence, the ATK of "Terra Firma" would become 4500. This error is fixed on  the next chapter .
