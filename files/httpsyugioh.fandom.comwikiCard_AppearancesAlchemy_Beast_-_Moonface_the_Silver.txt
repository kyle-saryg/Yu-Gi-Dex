 In  episode 44 ,  Amnael  uses this card during his Duel against  Chazz Princeton . Chazz activates the effect of " Armed Dragon LV7 " to send " Despair from the Dark " from his hand to the Graveyard and destroy this card and " Alchemy Beast - Ouroboros the Bronze ". 
 In  episode 45 , Amnael uses this card during his Duel against  Jaden Yuki . He summons this card via " Silver Key ". On Amnael's next turn, this card, " Alchemy Beast - Eatos the Tin ", and " Alchemy Beast - Echeneis the Mercury " attack directly via their own effects. Later Jaden activates " Burst Return " to return "Clayman", "Avian", and " Elemental HERO Bubbleman " to his hand. He then activates " Burst Impact " to destroy all monsters on the field except "Burstinatrix" and inflict 300 damage to both players for each of their monsters that were destroyed. Since four of Amnael's monsters were destroyed, he takes 1200 damage. All of Amnael's monsters were then banished due to the effect of " Alchemic Kettle - Chaos Distill ". In  the next episode , this card is shown when Amnael was counting up the number of banished monsters for the effect of " Helios Duo Megistus ". After Jaden summons " Elemental HERO Electrum ", the latter's effect returns all banished monsters to their owners' Decks. 
 Its attack is called  Silver Cutter  in the original and  Shockwave Slammer  in the dub.
