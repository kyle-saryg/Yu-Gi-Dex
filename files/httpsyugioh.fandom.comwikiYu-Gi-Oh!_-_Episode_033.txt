 Summary 
 It is the final match of the  Duelist Kingdom  finals.  Yugi Muto  faces  Joey Wheeler  and whoever wins will face  Maximillion Pegasus  afterwards. This is a really tough  Duel  for both Duelists, as they are both best friends, but must face each other to get what they want (Yugi the chance to Duel Pegasus and save his grandpa,  Solomon Muto , and the  Kaiba   brothers ; Joey the chance to win the prize money needed to pay for  Serenity 's eye operation).  Téa  and  Tristan  are upset about them having to Duel each other like this. Joey and Yugi fight their hardest, each turn  destroying  each other's  monsters  and lowering each other's  Life Points .
 Joey gets the upper hand by using " Copycat " as " Polymerization ", fusing his " Red-Eyes Black Dragon " and Yugi's " Summoned Skull " (which he took via " Graverobber ") to  Fusion Summon  the " Black Skull Dragon ". It destroys Yugi's " Gaia the Dragon Champion ", one of his strongest cards, and leaves him with just 550  Life Points . Joey still has 750. Who will win this Duel of friendship, Yugi or Joey?

"Flame Swordsman" attacks and destroys "Summoned Skull" (Yugi: 1550 → 1150 LP). On Joey's  End Phase , the  effect  of "Shield & Sword" expires ("Flame Swordsman": 1600 → 1800/1800 → 1600, "Gaia The Fierce Knight": 2100 → 2300/2300 → 2100).

"Black Skull Dragon" attacks and destroys "Gaia the Dragon Champion" (Yugi: 1150 → 550 LP).
 Duel continues in the next episode . 
 
 Differences in adaptations 
 Just before the Duel starts, flashbacks of  Joey  and  Yugi  together are added to the English version with " No Matter What " playing, whilst the Japanese version just shows  Croquet  telling the duelists to begin and an overhead shot of the Duel field. 
 Cut from the dub is a long sequence of first staring with a pan across the Duel field, then  Yugi  asking  Joey  what he is going to do next, following with  Joey  then staring at his hand wondering what he can do to defeat " Gaia the Dragon Champion " since his strongest monster is " Red-Eyes Black Dragon ". 
 Interestingly, in the original manga, this duel does not occur because Pegasus reads the minds of Joey and Yugi and decides against having the finals as the two are friends. 
 Mistakes 
 Both " Giltia the D. Knight " and " Flame Swordsman " are shown as  Normal Monsters  in the dub even though they are generally shown as Fusion Monsters in the dub. 
 There is an error on the VHS release. The sixth and seven turns of the Duel are skipped during the scene transition, making " Gaia the Dragon Champion " appear and " Summoned Skull " be in the Graveyard already.
