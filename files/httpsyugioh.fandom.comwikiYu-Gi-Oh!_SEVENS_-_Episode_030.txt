 " Tiger's Breath ", known as  The Tiger Way of Battle " in Japan, is the thirtieth episode of the  Yu-Gi-Oh! SEVENS  anime. It first aired in Japan on December 26, 2020. The dubbed version was made available on platforms like Hulu and DisneyNOW in the US in August 2022, and is set to air on Disney XD on October 22, 2022.
 Due to Luke misunderstanding, Yuga and co. end up entering the Trumpet Duet Tournament... They visit the Music Club to learn how to play an instrument, but they find the music room in darkness, and suddenly, they are attacked by someone! Then, behind Luke, who is scared more than usual for some reason,  Tiadosia Kallister  (aka Tiger) appears brandishing a silver bassoon!
 
 Featured Duel: Yuga Ohdo vs Tiadosia Kallister (Tiger) 
 Turn 1: Tiger 
Tiger Normal Summons two  Brassax Knuckle the Melee Music Maiden  (1000/1200). She sacrifices both of them to conduct two Tribute Summons, summoning two copies of  Trumpetonfa, the Assault Music Maiden  (1600/1000). She then activates the effect of both monsters, sending the top card of her deck to the GY to increase the ATK of a monster on her field by the number of Brassax Knuckles in her GY times 100 (Trumpetonfa 1600 → 1800 ATK). She activates the Spell Card  Breath of the Music Maidens  to Special Summon one Warrior-Type monster from her GY. She chooses to summon a third copy of Trumpetonfa. Tiger activates the effect of her third Trumpetonfa (Trumpetonfa 1600 → 1900 ATK). She ends her turn, causing her monsters to return to their original ATK (Trumpetonfa 1800/1900 → 1600 ATK).
 Turn 2: Yuga 
Yuga Normal Summons  Whispering Fairy  (800/1200) and  Sparkhearts Girl  (800/1200). He sends a card from his hand to the GY to activate Whispering Fairy's effect, shuffling two Brassax Knuckles from Tiger's GY back into her deck. Yuga then sends a monster from his hand to the GY to activate Sparkhearts Girl's effect, lowering the ATK of one Trumpetonfa by 500 and allowing him to set the Trap Card  Curtain of Sparks  from his GY (Trumpetonfa 1600 → 1100 ATK). Yuga sacrifices Whispering Fairy and Sparkhearts Girl to Tribute Summon  Sevens Road Magician  (2100/1500). He activates Sevens Road Magician's effect by sending the top card opf his deck to the GY, increasing the ATK of Sevens Road Magician by 300 points for every different Attribute in his GY. Yuga has three different Attributes in his GY, so Sevens Road Magician gains 900 ATK (Sevens Road Magician 2100 → 3000 ATK). Sevens Road Magician attacks and destroys the weakened Trumpetonfa (Tiger 4000 → 2100 LP). Yuga ends his turn (Sevens Road Magician 3000 → 2100 ATK).
 Turn 3: Tiger 
Tiger Normal Summons Brassax Knuckles before sacrificing Brassax Knuckles and one of her two Trumpetonfas to Tribute Summon  Ensemble Fighter the Heavy Music Oni  (2200/2200). Tiger Normal Summons another Brassax Knuckles and sacrifices it to Normal Summon  Nunchuclarinet the Whirling Music Maiden  (1600/). She then activates Nunchuclarinet's effect, sending the top card of her deck to the GY to, if it is a Wind-Attribute Warrior monster, decrease the ATK of one monster on Yuga's field by 500 for every monster on her field. However, the top card of her deck is revealed to be another copy of Breath of the Music Maidens, so Sevens Road Magician's ATK doesn't decrease. Tiger then activates the effect of Trumpetonfa, increasing Ensemble Fighter's ATK by the number of Brassax Knuckles in her GY times 100 (Ensemble Fighter 2200 → 2500 ATK). She then sends one card from her hand to the GY to activate Ensemble Fighter's effect, preventing Yuga from activating Trap Cards during the Battle Phase. Ensemble Fighter then attacks and destroys Sevens Road Magician before Nunchuclarinet and Trumpetonfa attack Yuga directly (Yuga 4000 → 400 LP). Tiger ends her turn (Ensemble Fighter 2500 → 2200 ATK).
 Turn 4: Yuga 
Yuga Normal Summons  Beast Summoner  (900/700). Since Tiger controls a face-up monster witl Level 6 or higher, he activates Beast Summoner's effect, sending Beast Summoner to the GY to Special Summon  Seis the Mighty King of Bestial Wings  (1900/2500) from his hand. Yuga sets two cards from his hand. Since the number of set cards in his Spell/Trap Zone now equals the number of monsters Tiger controls, Yuga activates Seis' effect, sending all three of his set cards to the GY to lower Ensemble Fighter's ATK by 1000 for every card he sent to the GY (Ensemble Fighter 2200 → 0 ATK). Yuga activates the Spell card  Sparks  to deal 200 points of damage to Tiger (Tiger 2100 → 1900 LP). Seis attacks and destroys Ensemble Fighter (Tiger 1900 → 0 LP).
