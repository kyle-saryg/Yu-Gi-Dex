 Summary 
       Dark ZEXAL , with  Astral  in control.     
 Yuma  wakes up, lying on his back in an area with a purple sky. He recalls that he and  Astral  were absorbed and thrown there together, and gets up, turning to see an Astral-shaped tower, with a stained-glass window in the place where Astral's heart would be. Yuma speculates that he's in Astral's heart, and runs towards the tower, calling his partner's name. Back in " Sargasso ", Yuma and Astral remain Overlaid by Dark ZEXAL, with Astral in control. Vector observes  ZEXAL , but notes that it's been completely devoured by evil, as his eyes glow. In Astral's heart, Yuma rushes up the stairs, thinking that there are so many things that he has to apologize for. Standing by the window, Astral states that Yuma has "betrayed" him. Rocks begin to fall inside the tower, and Yuma dodges them.
 
       " DZW - Chimera Clad " equipped to " Number C39: Utopia Ray V ".     
 Under the influence of the darkness, Astral declares that the power of darkness will also dye the card to be drawn into the darkness (in the original, Dark ZEXAL uses Astral's voice, while in the dub, Yuma's voice is used instead); declaring a " Dark Draw ", much to Vector's interest (in the dub, Vector says, "Oh, please" mockingly). He Summons his new card - " DZW - Chimera Clad ." Astral uses the effect of his new card to destroy " Vain Betrayer ", much to Vector's shock, and then since he did so, he equips "Chimera Clad" to " Number C39: Utopia Ray V "; while it negates its effects, it will prevent it from being destroyed in battle. "Chimera Clad" is surrounded by blue energy and transforms into a set of armor that equips to "Utopia Ray V" who combines its swords at the hilt and forms a beam scythe. Astral attacks " Number 104: Masquerade ." "Utopia Ray V" twirls its scythe, then hurls it towards "Masquerade". Vector is surprised and says "What are you thinking?!"; "Masquerade" has the higher ATK, and he'll take damage even if "Utopia Ray V" isn't destroyed. Astral's  Life Points  fall from 1100 to 1000 allowing the other effect of his monster to activate; as it wasn't destroyed in battle, the effect doubles its ATK and allows it to attack again using " Dark Charge ". 
 A portal appears underneath "Utopia Ray V" and surrounds it with a dark red aura. Vector is again taken aback, and Astral declares a second attack with "Utopia Ray V". Angered, Vector quickly activates a  Trap Card , " Extra Hundred ," allowing him to prevent the destruction of "Masquerade". "Masquerade" blocks the attack with one of its wings. The attack deals massive damage to Vector, knocking him over and reducing him to 1300  Life Points , depleting the Life Points he gained from "Vain Betrayer". "Extra Hundred" also allows "Utopia Ray V" to attack again. Astral doesn't hesitate to attack, but Vector activates the other effect of "Extra Hundred", which will make sure that "Masquerade" always has 100 more ATK than "Utopia Ray V". "Masquerade" blocks the attack with its rings, causing the scythe thrown by "Utopia Ray V" to spin back and strike Astral. Astral takes another 100 damage, reducing him to 900 Life Points, but he simply continues to use the effect of "Chimera Clad" to double the ATK of "Utopia Ray V" again, to 10400. "Utopia Ray V" attacks again with the effect of "Chimera Clad".
 Cathy  is shocked, pointing out that "Extra Hundred" will continue to make sure that "Masquerade" always has the higher ATK value.  Flip  adds that even if he continues to attack, he'll just receive the damage (Cathy's and Flip's observations are cut from the dub). As "Utopia Ray V" attacks again, Vector laughs, before activating the effect of his Trap card again, which increases "Masquerade" to 10500 ATK, and it retaliates, reducing Astral to 800 Life Points. Vector observes that it seems like Astral's completely lost his mind, if he leaves him in this state (in the dub, Vector notes that Astral is destroying himself, making it easier for him to do his job).
 In his heart, Astral states that Yuma is the evil (in the dub, Astral says Yuma is a devious individual). He betrayed him, and the doubt, anger, and sorrow, are due to Yuma being the evil who brought it to him. As Yuma continues to climb, he looks up to see several red-eyed wolf-like creatures before him, which lunge out at him. In "Sargasso", Astral activates the effect of "Chimera Clad" once again, declaring "Dark Charge", and the ATK of "Utopia Ray V" increases to 20800, before attacking "Masquerade" once again. Astral states that he can't believe in Yuma anymore, as Yuma, who is visibly tiring, climbs the stairs while resting his hand against the wall. In the  Different Dimension Airship , Flip protests that he doesn't want it sick like that (in the dub, he calls the situation disastrous).  Caswell  adds that if this goes on, and Yuma's Life Points fall to 500, he'll lose due to the effect of "Sargasso" in the end.  Tori  begs Yuma to come to his senses. 
 
       A dark Astral informs  Yuma  of the new power he gained called "Evil".     
 Yuma finds Astral's subconscious, and calls out his name. Astral asks Yuma how he has come here. Yuma states that he came to apologize. Astral asks him why he would do that (in the dub, Astral says there is no need for that). Yuma is surprised at this, and Astral continues to explain: indeed, Yuma has betrayed him, and he lost the ability to believe in him (in the dub, Astral specifies that Yuma had kept his friendship with a Barian a secret). But in exchange, it allowed him to obtain a new power called "Evil", punctuating this statement by turning towards Yuma and resuming the darker color scheme he had taken on before overlaying them into Dark ZEXAL. Yuma is greatly shocked, and Astral admits that he didn't know that evil and hatred had such a strong power. Astral continues to attack in "Sargasso", his Life Points at 700, declaring "Dark Charge" as the ATK of "Utopia Ray V" is again doubled, to 41600, before attacking "Masquerade" again. At 41700 ATK itself, "Masquerade" deflects the attack back at Astral with its rings, reducing Astral to 600 as he laughs, standing with his arms spread wide. Tori begs him to stop. Flip points out that with one more attack, it will be all over for Yuma and Astral. 
 
         Yuma embraces Astral.     
 In his heart, Astral states that he knows, now that he's been filled with power as Yuma stared on in complete utter horror of what he became. He wants more hatred, rage, and distrust so that they fill him with more power and make him even stronger. His red aura intensifies, and Yuma falls to his knees in tears, blaming himself for what he did to Astral. Astral tauntingly thanks him by giving him a malicious stare, as he brought the power to him, and when he is filled up with hatred, he will be given the power to destroy everything. Purple energy erupts from him and hides him from view, as he shouts for it to blacken his entire being, while a pair of red eyes form in the mist. As he can't watch Astral being consumed by the vile darkness, Yuma runs towards him, who retaliates and attacks him with several black tentacles in a manner similar to  Number 96 . Yuma dodges his strikes and embraces Astral, throwing them out of the window. In "Sargasso", Astral declares "Dark Charge" again, and the ATK of "Utopia Ray V" increases to 83200 ATK. Vector adds that that's good; just attack him one last time, and this will be his end. Everyone looks on in horror. 
 Yuma and Astral continue to fall, enveloped in a yellow light, as "Utopia Ray V" attacks "Masquerade." At the same time, Astral is struck by a feeling, much to Vector's surprise. Tori gasps in horror as Astral is thrown into the sky, glowing purple. Dark ZEXAL is reversed, with Yuma and Astral splitting apart and landing on the ground as the others watch. Tori calls out their names, while  Shark  mutters Yuma's name himself (cut from the dub). Yuma, having regained consciousness, looks up at Astral, and calls out his name, but Shark and  Kite  contact Yuma to tell him to stop the attack from "Utopia Ray V", saying that he would lose otherwise. Yuma quickly does so, ending his turn. Vector is disappointed, but points out that Yuma will still have to take the damage from "Sargasso." Seeing the lightning gathering above him, Yuma turns and runs towards Astral, and is knocked off his feet by the blast, reducing him to 100 Life Points. Vector points out that Yuma has only 100  Life Points  left,  and  only a single card in his Deck, and on top of that, Astral is in such a terrible condition, asking if he'll just give up already, before bursting out in cackles. Yuma angrily refuses, saying he won't give up, that Astral and his friends are important to him, and that he absolutely won't let Vector hurt them any longer. Fading on the ground, Astral can only murmur Yuma's name.
 
         " Number C104: Umbral Horror Masquerade " is Summoned.     
 Vector scoffs, and begins his turn. He asks them to let him show them his true power, and activates his own " Rank-Up-Magic Barian's Force ",  Ranking-Up  "Masquerade" and Xyz Summoning his  Chaos Number . He chants "Born from Chaos, when the Barian's Force will cover up the light, the great Darkness will dance!", as he Summons " Number C104: Umbral Horror Masquerade ," with 3000 ATK. Astral, still fluctuating due to Yuma's low Life Points, weakly asks that even though their bond is severed, how can Yuma go on fighting? (Astral's question is cut from the dub) Vector activates the effect of "Barian's Force", and attaches the Overlay Units of "Utopia Ray V" to itself and reducing the ATK of "Utopia Ray" by 300 for each Overlay Unit removed, to 82900. But he isn't done yet - the effect of "Umbral Horror" then activates, allowing Vector to destroy a card in Yuma's Spell/Trap Zone. He destroys "Chimera Clad" with "Destroy Step". "Umbral Horror" twirls its staff, then releases a wave of fiery energy from it at "Utopia Ray V", destroying its  Equip Card  and reducing its ATK to 2300. 
 Vector observes that now that their Equip Card is gone, they've lost all of the ATK that Astral shaved away their Life Points to gain. "Umbral Horror" then attacks "Utopia Ray V", firing a blast of dark energy from its staff. Tori screams Yuma's name, but Yuma activates his face-down " Xyz Revenge Shuffle ", returning "Utopia Ray V" to the  Extra Deck , and Special Summoning " Number 39: Utopia " from his Graveyard in Attack Position, reducing the battle damage to 0 and letting "Umbral Horror" attack again. Vector asks him if he's an idiot, beginning to remind him of "Sargasso", but Yuma then activates the effect of " Interceptomato " in his Graveyard, banishing it to negate the damage he would have taken from "Sargasso". Multiple "Interceptomatoes" burst out from a Graveyard portal and shield Yuma from the lightning blast. Vector irritably observes the disadvantages of Deck Destruction (in the dub, Vector exclaims that this changes nothing because "Umbral Horror" will just destroy "Utopia" and finish off Yuma regardless). Caswell comments that Yuma somehow managed to just save himself, and Flip calls the situation hopeless. Tori reminds them that Yuma is fighting on desperately; he is fighting to save them and Astral all by himself (this is cut from the dub). Vector states that he'll just use the effect of "Xyz Revenge Shuffle" to attack again, but Yuma activates the effect of the " Spell Recycler " in his Graveyard, sending " Xyz Agent " (remembering that was the only card he hadn't sent it to the Graveyard yet) from the top of his Deck to the Graveyard, and adding " Rank-Up-Magic Limited Barian's Force " to the bottom of his Deck. 
 Vector asks what exactly is the point of Yuma doing this and continues his attack with "Umbral Horror". Yuma then activates the effect of the "Xyz Agent" in his Graveyard, his palm glowing with energy. He banishes it to activate the effect of an Xyz Monster that requires detaching Overlay Units. "Xyz Agent" emerges from the Graveyard portal and opens its briefcase; an Overlay Unit flies out and is absorbed by "Utopia". Yuma activates the effect of "Utopia", which would involve detaching an Overlay Unit to negate the attack with its "Light Wing Shield" effect.
 
         Yuma's  Life Points  are reduced to 25.     
 Watching from his Duel with Shark,  Dumon  remarks that by managing to dodge all this, Yuma has only gained a bit of time (in the dub, Dumon comments that while Yuma managed to survive this turn, he won't the next). He also asks if Shark still believes that Yuma will still win despite what he had been through. Shark, with " Number C32: Shark Drake Veiss " hovering in front of him, replies that he does believe in Yuma. Dumon asks him why, and Shark replies that he  wants  to trust in him, which is why he believes in him and that's what trust is all about, right? (in the dub, Shark says that he has seen Yuma Duel and that he refuses to give up, while adding that Vector is in for a rude awakening) Dumon repeats "trust?" (in the dub, Dumon did not say anything at this point) 
 Commenting that Yuma still won't give up, Vector activates the effect of "Umbral Horror" twice, detaching two Overlay Units to halve Yuma's Life Points for each one detached and discarding two random cards from Yuma's hand each time. He declares "Dark Plunder" as "Umbral Horror" releases waves of purple energy, which knock Yuma to the ground, quartering his Life Points down to 25. Afterward, " Chachaka Archer " and " Giant Hunter " are discarded from Yuma's hand. He asks how's that - with Yuma having only 25 Life Points, one card in his Deck, no cards in his hand or Set cards on the field, one might think he's in a bit of a fix here. He laughs, watched by  Mizar , who mutters "that Vector..." (in the dub, Mizar did not say anything) Kite, with " Neo Galaxy-Eyes Photon Dragon " behind him, asks him what he's looking at. Mizar is surprised, asking if Kite doesn't care about his friend. Kite replies that he doesn't know about that - he just believes in Yuma Tsukumo as a Duelist, that's it (in the dub, Kite says he isn't the one who's up against Yuma). Vector tauntingly Sets " Barian Explosion ", thinking that he'll give Yuma the finishing blow with the card, as his final card is "Limited Barian's Force".
 
         Yuma believes in hope.     
 Yuma still isn't giving up, and Vector asks what's the matter, commenting that by the looks of things it doesn't look like he has the strength to draw (in the dub, Vector questions if the turn will be worth taking). He questions if Yuma will still go on, despite his severed bond with Astral. Yuma agrees, but even though they've been buried in the graveyard by those tricks, as long as he believes in the power of the feelings that are stacked there, there will always be a card by the name of Hope to help him. Vector laughs, calling it nice talk, (in the dub, Vector chides Yuma, telling him to listen to himself that the "hope" he believed in was a lie) but his last hope is resting on  that  card; the proof of friendship between him and Ray. Yuma admits that that's right, but now all he can do is draw that card (in the dub, he says that's right now, he's dueling for a  real   friend), and believe in the hope of the last draw. He begins his turn, drawing the last card in his Deck, "Rank-Up-Magic Limited Barian's Force", and Vector sneers. Yuma then collapses, and Tori calls out his name. Yuma and Astral whisper each other's names, reaching for one another. Astral says that he can no longer believe in Yuma as he did before, but adds that, like Yuma, he still wants to believe in hope and fight together despite all hardships. Whispering each other's names again, they place the palms of their hands together, and then they declare "kattobingu". 
 Light shines from their hands, and everyone watches in disbelief.  Rio  intones that the heart and heart, shining with hope, the strong bond that connects the two of them shall call forth a miracle (the reactions of Yuma's friends are cut from the dub). Vector is furious, but his fury is only escalated as Yuma, supported by Astral, Overlays with him, and they take on their energy forms and perform ZEXAL Morph again, a large red "X" flashing as they do so, revealing that their combined form has  evolved . Astral chants, "When two hearts connected by true bonds reunite, the legendary miracle shall appear" ("When two hearts join together in the spirit of hope, nothing is impossible" in the dub). Yuma's friends cheer at the sight, while the Barians are in shock. Yuma then materializes, wearing a white armor, part of his hair grew longer and the black part of his hair changed into orange. His left eye glows with piercing lights. They declare, "ZEXAL II!" (in the dub, they do not declare this; instead, they shout, "It's over, Vector!") 
 
         " ZEXAL II " emerges.     
 Vector is shocked at the sight of a new ZEXAL, but right now, their evolution is a bit too late (in the dub, Vector says that they can dress up as much as they like, but this does not change the fact that they will lose). They ask if that is so, and Vector shrieks "what?!" The newly bonded duo declare that passionate feelings reunited will rebuild hope for the future of the world as they hold up a glowing "Rank-Up-Magic Limited Barian's Force" and perform a Shining Evolution, emblazoning their "Limited Barian's Force" with the  Numeron Code's  power, transforming it into a new "Rank-Up-Magic" card " Numeron Force ".
 
         ZEXAL II creates " Rank-Up-Magic Numeron Force ."       Vector is horrified that they actually modified the card. Astral states that the light of miracle repels the darkness, and calls out the true appearance of "Limited Barian's Force". They activate the new card, Ranking-Up "Utopia" and Special Summoning a "Chaos Number," chanting "Chaos Number 39! Grasp victory on the shining future! Gathering feelings, connected by the hearts, will change the world!" "Utopia" is shown being encased in new armor, forming the new monster, " Number C39: Utopia Ray Victory " who appears with 2800 ATK. Vector is shocked to see the new monster, but points out that due to the effect of "Sargassso" they're finished, but Yuma explains that "Numeron Force" negates the effects of all cards on the field other than "Victory", preventing the game-ending damage again. Vector can only scream in protest.
         ZEXAL II defeats  Vector .     
 Yuma and Astral attack "Umbral Horror" with "Victory", activating its effect to add the ATK of "Umbral Horror" to its own. "Utopia Ray Victory" extends an extra pair of arms, and all four arms draw swords as its ATK rises to 5800 with "Victory Charge." Vector repeats the ATK value in a daze, and Yuma declares that this is their, with Astral adding "bond's power!" They tell "Utopia Ray Victory" to crush Vector and "Umbral Horror Masquerade" with " Rising Sun Double Victory Slash "; "Utopia Ray Victory" slashes two "V" formations with its swords, destroying "Umbral Horror". Realizing that he's going to lose, Vector screams in terror as the attack connects, his Life Points falling to 0. The attack badly injures Vector, damaging his wing, and the Barian screams in agony as he is thrown across the stone by the impact, rolling to a stop. Everyone on board the Different Dimension Airship cheers, and outside,  Bronk  yells that Yuma did it, with Rio adding that it's a huge reversal. Shark comments that that was a thriller (in the dub, Shark says it took Yuma long enough to win), but then the dimension begins to shake. 
 Shark asks what's going on and Dumon states that this is bad, knowing that this wasteland is collapsing in on itself. He contacts Mizar, who is equally as confused as Shark, and orders him to retreat, much to Mizar's surprise. Due to the energy of light released during the Duel by the new ZEXAL, the balance of "Sargasso" has been disrupted. Mizar protests, but Dumon asks him if he wants to be swallowed by the gap between the different dimensions (in the dub, Dumon asks if Mizar wanted to be stuck in "Sargasso" forever). He looks at Kite and "Neo Galaxy-Eyes Photon Dragon," and says Kite's name angrily (in the dub, Mizar angrily says, "Next time..."). Vector curses Yuma and Astral and tells them not to think they've won just yet. They defuse as he stands up, and he warns them to listen well: the evil stain that contaminated Astral's heart will not disappear. The feeling of that stain will last forever. (in the dub, Vector also adds that it will gnaw at Yuma and Astral's bond and destroy it.) He shakes with laughter before transporting himself away through an Overlay Network.
 
         Yuma jumps in the air, saying "bring it on!".     
 Green light shines on Yuma and Astral, transporting them back to the Different Dimension Airship, and the group escapes the exploding "Sargasso." They return to Earth in the Different Dimension Airship, as the sun sets. Yuma asks Astral if they won. Astral states that they did, but their battle has just begun. Yuma is determined to become stronger. He jumps into the air, saying "Kattobingu!" as everyone looks on. (in the dub, he says "Well I say, bring it on!")
 
 
 Featured Duels 
 Yuma Tsukumo vs. Vector 
 Duel continues from  the previous episode .
 Turn 5: Yuma/Astral (Dark ZEXAL) 
 Astral  has just executed ZEXAL Morph with Yuma, resulting in  Dark ZEXAL . Astral performs a  Dark Draw  and gets " DZW - Chimera Clad " (Yuma's Deck: 2 → 1). Astral then  Normal Summon  "DZW - Chimera Clad" ( 1/0/0) in Attack Position. He then  activates  the first  effect  of "Chimera Clad" to destroy " Vain Betrayer " (a  Spell  or  Trap Card ) and equip it to " Chaos Number 39: Utopia Ray V ". Due to the second effect of "Chimera Clad", the effects of "Utopia Ray V" are negated. "Utopia Ray V" attacks " Number 104: Masquerade ", but the former is not destroyed due to the third effect of "Chimera Clad" (Yuma: 1100 → 1000 LP). 
 As Astral took Battle Damage, he activates the final effect of "Chimera Clad" to double the ATK of "Utopia Ray V" ("Utopia Ray V": 2600 → 5200 ATK) and allow it to attack again. "Utopia Ray V" attacks "Masquerade", but Vector activates his  face-down  " Extra Hundred " to prevent "Masquerade" from being destroyed (Vector: 3800 → 1300 LP), but letting "Utopia Ray V" attack again this turn. "Utopia Ray V" attacks "Masquerade" again, but  Vector  activates the second effect of "Extra Hundred", which makes the ATK of "Masquerade" equal to the ATK of "Utopia Ray V" plus 100 whenever it's targeted for an attack ("Masquerade": 2700 → 5300 ATK). "Utopia Ray V" is not destroyed (Yuma: 1000 → 900 LP). Astral then activates the fourth effect of "Chimera Clad" ("Utopia Ray V": 5200 → 10400 ATK) to allow "Utopia Ray V" to attack again. 
 "Utopia Ray V" attacks "Masquerade" ("Masquerade": 5300 → 10500 ATK), but the former monster is not destroyed (Yuma: 900 → 800 LP). Astral activates the fourth effect of "Chimera Clad" ("Utopia Ray V": 10400 → 20800 ATK) to allow "Utopia Ray V" to attack again. "Utopia Ray V" attacks "Masquerade" ("Masquerade": 10500 → 20900 ATK), but the former monster is not destroyed (Yuma: 800 → 700 LP). Astral activates the fourth effect of "Chimera Clad" ("Utopia Ray V": 20800 → 41600 ATK) to allow "Utopia Ray V" to attack again. "Utopia Ray V" attacks "Masquerade" ("Masquerade": 20900 → 41700 ATK), but the former monster is not destroyed (Yuma: 700 → 600 LP). Astral activates the fourth effect of "Chimera Clad" ("Utopia Ray V": 41600 → 83200 ATK) to allow "Utopia Ray V" to attack again. 
 "Utopia Ray V" attacks "Masquerade", but  Yuma  cancels Dark ZEXAL at this point, splitting him and Astral. Yuma ends his turn before the attack can land. On Yuma's  End Phase , the first effect of " Sargasso the Different Dimension Battlefield " activates (Yuma: 600 → 100 LP).
 Turn 6: Vector 
Vector draws " Rank-Up-Magic Barian's Force " and subsequently activates it to  Rank-Up  "Masquerade" via  Chaos Xyz Evolution  in order to Xyz Summon " Chaos Number 104: Umbral Horror Masquerade " ( 5/3000/1500, ORU: 1) in Attack Position. By the last effect of "Rank-Up-Magic Barian's Force", the  Overlay Units   attached  to "Utopia Ray V" are attached to "Umbral Horror Masquerade" instead ("Utopia Ray V": 1 → 0 ORU, "Umbral Horror Masquerade": 1 → 2 ORU) and "Utopia Ray V" loses 300 ATK for each one ("Utopia Ray V": 83200 → 82900 ATK). As it was Special Summoned, Vector activates the second effect of "Umbral Horror Masquerade", destroying "Chimera Clad" (a card in Yuma's  Spell & Trap Card Zone ) ("Utopia Ray V": 82900 → 2300 ATK). 
 "Umbral Horror Masquerade" attacks "Utopia Ray V", but Yuma activates his face-down " Xyz Revenge Shuffle " to target "Utopia Ray V". "Umbral Horror Masquerade" destroys "Utopia Ray V", but "Xyz Revenge Shuffle" nullifies the battle damage Yuma takes,  returns  "Utopia Ray V" to the  Extra Deck , and revives " Number 39: Utopia " ( 4/2500/2000) in  Attack Position . Due to the final effect of "Xyz Revenge Shuffle", "Umbral Horror Masquerade" can attack again since it was the monster that destroyed "Utopia Ray V".
 The first effect of "Sargasso" activates, but Yuma activates the effect of " Interceptomato " to  banish  it from his Graveyard and nullify the damage he would take. "Umbral Horror Masquerade" attacks "Utopia", but Yuma activates the effect of " Spell Recycler " to banish it from his Graveyard and send the top card of his  Deck  (" Xyz Agent ") to the Graveyard and place " Rank-Up-Magic Limited Barian's Force " (the  Normal Spell Card  closest to the bottom of his Graveyard) on the bottom of his Deck (Yuma's Deck: 0 → 1). Yuma activates the effect of "Xyz Agent" to banish it from his Graveyard (as an Xyz Monster he controls is battling an opponent's Xyz Monster) and activate the effect of "Utopia" that would be activated by detaching an Overlay Unit, negating the attack.
 Vector activates the third effect of "Umbral Horror Masquerade" twice, detaching two Overlay Units ("Umbral Horror Masquerade": 2 → 0 ORU) to halve Yuma's  Life Points  twice (Yuma: 100 → 25 LP) and  discard  two  random  cards from Yuma's hand (" Chachaka Archer " and " Giant Hunter "). Vector Sets " Barian Explosion ", which will allow Vector to look at Yuma's hand, destroy all cards in Yuma's hand if there is a " Barian " card in it, and inflict 1000 damage to Yuma. Vector intends to activate his set card when Yuma draws "Rank-Up-Magic Limited Barian's Force.
 Turn 7: Yuma/Astral (Zexal II) 
Yuma draws "Rank-Up-Magic Limited Barian's Force" (Yuma's Deck: 1 → 0). He and Astral now perform  ZEXAL Morph , becoming  ZEXAL II . Yuma performs  Shining Evolution  on "Rank-Up-Magic Limited Barian's Force" transforming it into its true form - " Rank-Up-Magic Numeron Force ". Yuma then activates "Rank-Up-Magic Numeron Force" to Rank-Up "Utopia" via Chaos Xyz Evolution in order to Xyz Summon " Chaos Number 39: Utopia Ray Victory " ( 5/2800/2500, ORU: 1) in Attack Position. Due to the first effect of "Rank-Up-Magic Numeron Force", the effects of all face-up cards on the field are negated, except for "Rank-Up-Magic Numeron Force and "Utopia Ray Victory". "Utopia Ray Victory" attacks "Umbral Horror Masquerade" and Yuma activates the effect of "Utopia Ray Victory" to increase its ATK by the ATK of "Umbral Horror Masquerade" by detaching "Utopia" ("Utopia Ray Victory": 1 → 0 ORU, 2800 → 5800 ATK). "Utopia Ray Victory" then destroys "Umbral Horror Masquerade" (Vector: 1300 → 0 LP).

 Mistakes 
         " Number C39: Utopia Ray " instead of " Number 39: Utopia ".     
 Before  Yuma   activated  " Rank-Up-Magic Numeron Force ", " Number C39: Utopia Ray " can be seen on his  D-Pad  instead of " Number 39: Utopia ". In addition, the  card backing  of the card in his hand has the old backing. This was corrected in the English dub. 
         Card backing  errors.     
 While  equipped  with " DZW - Chimera Clad ", "Utopia Ray V" is shown with the Number 39 on both his right shoulder plate and left shoulder plate during his first  attack  as well as when Yuma cancelled his attack. 
 The written lore of " Number C104: Umbral Horror Masquerade " states it  negates  a  monster 's  effect ,  discards  a card from the opponent's  hand , and halves their  Life Points . Derspite this,  Vector  negated no monster effects but still  resolved  the rest of the effect 
 When Yuma drew "Rank-Up-Magic Limited Barian's Force" on the final turn of the Duel, cards can still be seen in the Deck slot of Yuma's D-Pad despite the fact that "Limited Barian's Force" was the final card in Yuma's Deck. 
 Trivia 
         The  Yu-Gi-Oh! ZEXAL  logo's "x".     
 When  Yuma  and  Astral  perform  ZEXAL  for the second time, the generated light has the same shape as the "x" in the  Yu-Gi-Oh! ZEXAL  logo. This is much probably intentional, just like how this new transformation is called " ZEXAL II ", identical to the series' "new name". 
 " Number C39: Utopia Ray V " attained 83200 ATK, briefly giving it the highest finite ATK total in the entire  Yu-Gi-Oh!  franchise, only to be broken 42 episodes later by  Don Thousand 's " Number C1000: Numeronius "
