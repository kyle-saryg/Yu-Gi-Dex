 "Across Time and Space!"  is the thirty-ninth chapter of the  Yu-Gi-Oh! ARC-V  manga .
 This chapter was first printed in October in the December 2018 issue of  V Jump , released on October 21, 2018.
 
 Summary 
 Yuya  brings out a  divine-eyed dragon  to battle  G.O.D.  The two divine dragons battle each other in the final confrontation, to determine the fate of the future world.
 
 Featured Duel: Yuya Sakaki/Yuto/Yugo/Yuri vs. Eve/G.O.D. 
 Duel continues from the previous Scale . 
 Turn 9: Yuya Sakaki 
 Yuya  has summoned " G.O.D.-Eyes Phantom Dragon " (3000/2500). "G.O.D.-Eyes Phantom Dragon" attacks " Genesis Omega Dragon ", but G.O.D. activates the latter's effect, placing " Nova Portal "  face-up  from the  Extra Deck  to the  Pendulum Zone  to  negate that attack .
 Turn 10: G.O.D. 
At the start of every  turn  the ATK of "Genesis Omega Dragon" increases by 1000 ("Genesis Omega Dragon": 4000 → 5000 ATK). Since the previous attack of "G.O.D.-Eyes Phantom Dragon" was negated,  G.O.D.'s  turn is skipped and the turn moves to Yuya's next  Battle Phase .
 Turn 11: Yuya Sakaki 
At the start of every turn the ATK of "Genesis Omega Dragon" increases by 1000 ("Genesis Omega Dragon": 5000 → 6000 ATK). "G.O.D.-Eyes Phantom Dragon" attacks "Genesis Omega Dragon". Since "G.O.D.-Eyes Phantom Dragon" was  Special Summoned  using four  monsters  as  tributes , the ATK of "Genesis Omega Dragon" is reduced by that amount times 1000, and "G.O.D.-Eyes Phantom Dragon" gains that much ATK ("Genesis Omega Dragon": 6000 → 2000 ATK; "G.O.D.-Eyes Phantom Dragon": 3000 → 7000 ATK). G.O.D. uses its effect, placing the face-up "Nova Portal" from the Extra Deck to the Pendulum Zone, negating the attack and ending Yuya's turn. Since the turn ended, the effect of "G.O.D.-Eyes Phantom Dragon" expires ("G.O.D.-Eyes Phantom Dragon": 7000 → 3000 ATK; "Genesis Omega Dragon": 2000 → 6000 ATK).
 Turn 12: G.O.D. 
At the start of every turn, the ATK of "Genesis Omega Dragon" increases by 1000 ("Genesis Omega Dragon": 6000 → 7000 ATK). Since the previous attack of "G.O.D.-Eyes Phantom Dragon" was negated, G.O.D.'s turn is skipped, and the turn moves to Yuya's next Battle Phase.
 Turn 13: Yuya Sakaki 
At the start of every turn, the ATK of "Genesis Omega Dragon" increases by 1000 ("Genesis Omega Dragon": 7000 → 8000 ATK). "G.O.D.-Eyes Phantom Dragon" attacks "Genesis Omega Dragon" ("Genesis Omega Dragon": 8000 → 4000 ATK; "G.O.D.-Eyes Phantom Dragon": 3000 → 7000 ATK), but G.O.D. activates the  Pendulum Effect  of "Nova Portal": it destroys both copies of "Nova Portal" to negate the effect of "G.O.D.-Eyes Phantom Dragon" and end the turn. However, Yuya activates the effect of "G.O.D.-Eyes Phantom Dragon", sending the  set  card in his  Spell & Trap Zone  to his  Graveyard , negating the effect of "Nova Portal", and setting the two copies of "Nova Portal" face-down in G.O.D.'s Pendulum Zones.
 The attack continues and "G.O.D.-Eyes Phantom Dragon" destroys "Genesis Omega Dragon" (G.O.D.: 3000 → 0 LP).
