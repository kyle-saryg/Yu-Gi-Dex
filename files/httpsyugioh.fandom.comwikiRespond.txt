 Respond
 
 
 Responding  (Japanese:  対 す  Taisu ) is the act of  activating  card or  effect  "when" an event or activation has taken place. Since responding necessarily requires activating a card or effect, it always makes a  Chain Link . There are two different kinds of responding:
 
 Responding to an  activation  (an action that creates a  Chain Link ). 
 Responding to an event (an action performed when  resolving  a Chain Link or outside of a  Chain  entirely). 
 If a card or effect can only be activated in response to an event, but another event performed strictly afterward means that it is not possible to activate a card or effect in response to that event, that card or effect  misses the timing .
 
 Responding to a non-activation action 
       "Chthonian Blast" can only be activated in response to a monster being destroyed.     
 Some cards and effects can only be activated in response to non- activation  actions. Both actions performed due to an effect (such as  banishing  a monster with " Dark Core ") and game actions (such conducting the  normal draw ) can be responded to.
 Only the most recent action can be responded to. For example, " Chthonian Blast " can be activated in response to a monster being destroyed by " Dark Hole " or " Gemini Spark " because the monster being destroyed is the last thing to happen, but cannot be activated in response to " Soul Taker " because  Life Points  are gained after the monster is destroyed. Being unable to activate "Chthonian Blast" in this circumstance is an example of  missing the timing . Cards with  Problem-Solving Card Text  use the conjunctives "and", "also", and "and if you do" to indicate simultaneity, and use "then" or "also, after that" to indicate that actions are performed in sequence.
 While building a  Chain , whatever action occurred before the construction of the Chain is still considered the last thing to happen. For example, if the turn player  declares  an  attack  and activates " Rising Energy " in response, their opponent can chain " Mirror Force ", because the attack declaration is still considered the last thing to happen (not the  discarding  action due to "Rising Energy").
 Actions that do not go on a Chain can only be responded to, not Chained to. It is incorrect to say that an action that does not go on a Chain is "Chained to".
 
 
 Responding to an activation 
 Japanese:  発 動 に 対 す,  Hatsudō ni Taisu 
       "Night Beam" prevents the target card from being activated in response to its activation.     
 When a card or effect is  activated , a card or effect activated in the following  Chain Link  is activated in response to that activation. Cards and effects activated in any other Chain Link of that same Chain are not in response to that activation.
 A card or effect that  negates  an activation can only do so if it is activated in response to the activation it would negate, unless it would negate the entire rest of the  Chain  (such as " Vanity's Call " or " Tachyon Transmigration ").
 If a card or an effect prevents a card(s) or effect(s) from being activated in response to its activation (such as " Night Beam " and the effect of " Uria, Lord of Searing Flames "), if a card or effect is activated in Chain to that activation, then those prevented card(s) and effect(s) can be activated in subsequent Chain Links because they are not in response to that card.
