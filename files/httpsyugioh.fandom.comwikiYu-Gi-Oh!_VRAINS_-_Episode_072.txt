 The Duel is conducted as a  Speed Duel .
 Turn 1: Playmaker 
Playmaker  activates  the  Spell Card  " Cynet Mining ", he sends " Dotscaper " from his hand to the graveyard, and add  Cyberse Gadget  from his deck to his hand. He then Normal Summon "Cyberse Gadget"(1400/300). As it was Normal Summoned, Playmaker activates the effect of "Cyberse Gadget" to Special Summon a Level 2 or lower monster from his graveyard with its effects negated. He Special Summons "Dotscaper" in Defense Position (0/2100). Playmaker uses "Dotscaper" to Link Summon "Linkuriboh" (300/LINK-1/↓). The effect of "Dotscaper" activates, Special Summoning itself from the GY. He then uses "Linkuriboh" and "Cyberse Gadget" to Link Summon " Cyberse Witch "(800/LINK-2/↙↓). Playmaker activates the other effect of "Cyberse Gadget", which lets him Special Summon a "Gadget Token" (0/0) to the bottom Link Point of "Cyberse Witch". As a monster was Special Summoned to a zone "Cyberse Witch" points to, he activates its effect, banishing "Cynet Mining" (A Spell) from his GY to add 2 cards (one Cyberse Ritual Monster, and 1 "Cynet Ritual") from his Deck to his hand and allowing him to Special Summon "Cyberse Gadget" (a Level 4 or lower Cyberse) from his Graveyard
 Playmaker activates "Cynet Ritual" from his hand, tributing his "Cyberse Gadget", "Cyberse Token" and "Dotscaper" to Ritual Summon " Cyberse Magician " (2500/2000). He then activates " Grid Rod " and equips it to "Cyberse Magician" (2500 → 2800 ATK).
 Turn 2: Bohman 
Bohman Normal Summons " Hydradrive Booster ". Bohman sets "Hydradrive Booster" in the Link Arrows to Link Summon " Flow Hydradrive " (1000/LINK-1/↓) to the Extra Monster Zone. Bohman activates the Spell " Hydradrive Rebuild ", targeting a " Hydradrive " monster he controls and destroying it, then if the "Hydradrive" monster that was destroyed by this effect activates its effect in his GY this turn, Bohman Special Summons a "Hydradrive" monster from his GY, but it cannot attack, its effects are negated, also it is destroyed during the End Phase. He targets and destroys "Flow Hydradrive". As "Flow Hydradrive" was destroyed by battle or card effect, Bohman activates its effect, Special Summoning a " Hydradrive Token " (0/0) in Defense Position. As "Flow Hydradrive" activated its effect from the GY, Bohman Special Summons "Flow Hydradrive" to the middle Main Monster Zone. Bohman activates the Link Spell " Judgment Arrows " (↖↑↗) at the Spell & Trap Zone the bottom-center Link Arrow of "Flow Hydradrive" points to. As a "Hydradrive" Link Monster Bohman controls was destroyed by a card effect this turn, Bohman activates the Quick-Play Spell " Hydradrive Defragment ", targeting a Spell/Trap Card Playmaker controls and destroying it. He targets and destroys "Grid Rod" ("Cyberse Magician": 2800 → 2500 ATK). As "Grid Rod" was sent to the GY while equipped to a monster, Playmaker activates its effect, making that monster unable to be destroyed battle or card effects this turn.
 Bohman sets a "Hydradrive Token" in the Link Arrows to Link Summon " Burn Hydradrive " (1000/LINK-1/↓) to a zone "Judgment Arrows" points to. Bohman activates the effect of "Hydradrive Defragment" in his GY, banishing it, then targeting a "Hydradrive" Spell in his GY to add it to his hand. He targets, adds, and subsequently activates "Hydradrive Rebuild", targeting a "Hydradrive" monster he controls and destroying it, then if the "Hydradrive" monster that was destroyed by this effect activates its effect in his GY this turn, Bohman Special Summons a "Hydradrive" monster from his GY, but it cannot attack, its effects are negated, also it is destroyed during the End Phase. He targets and destroys "Burn Hydradrive". As "Burn Hydradrive" was destroyed by battle or card effect, Bohman activates its effect, Special Summoning a "Hydradrive Token" (0/0) in Defense Position. As "Burn Hydradrive" activated its effect from the GY, Bohman Special Summons "Burn Hydradrive". Bohman sets a "Hydradrive Token" in the Link Arrows to Link Summon " Coolant Hydradrive " (1000/LINK-1/↓) to a zone "Judgment Arrows" points to.
 Bohman sets "Flow Hydradrive", "Burn Hydradrive" and "Coolant Hydradrive" to Link Summon " Trident Hydradrive Lord " (2300/LINK-3/←↓→) to a zone "Judgment Arrows" points to. As "Hydradrive Lord" was Link Summoned, Bohman activates its effect, targeting up to three "Hydradrive" Link Monsters in his GY that was used as materials for its Link Summon, and changing its Attribute on the field to become the same as those monsters'. He targets the WIND "Flow Hydradrive", the FIRE "Burn Hydradrive", and the WATER "Coolant Hydradrive". The effect of "Hydradrive Lord" negates the effects of monsters with the same Attributes as "Hydradrive Lord" while Playmaker controls them. Bohman Sets a card. "Hydradrive Lord" attacks "Cyberse Magician". If a Link Monster "Judgment Arrows" points to battles, its effect makes that monster's ATK become double its current ATK during damage calculation only ("Hydradrive Lord": 2300 → 4600 ATK). If "Cyberse Wizard" battles a Link Monster, its effect increases its ATK by 1000 during that damage calculation only ("Cyberse Magician": 2500 → 3500 ATK). The effect of "Cyberse Magician" halves any damage Playmaker takes. The attack continues and "Cyberse Magician" is not destroyed (Playmaker: 4000 → 3450 LP).
 Turn 3: Playmaker:  
Playmaker draws " Suspend Wand ". Playmaker activates the Equip Spell " Resume Mace ", equipping it to " Cyberse Magician ". The effect of "Resume Mace" decreases the ATK of the equipped "Cyberse Magician" by 800 ("Cyberse Magician": 2500 → 1700 LP). Playmaker activates the Equip Spell "Suspend Wand", equipping it to "Cyberse Magician". "Cyberse Magician" attacks "Hydradrive Lord". As the equipped "Cyberse Magician" declared an attack, Playmaker activates the effect of "Suspend Wand", this turn, the equipped "Cyberse Magician" cannot be destroyed by battle, and any battle damage Playmaker takes from that battle is doubled, also the equipped "Cyberse Magician" can make a second attack during each Battle Phase. During damage calculation, the effects of "Judgment Arrows" and "Cyberse Magician" apply ("Hydradrive Lord": 2300 → 4600 ATK, "Cyberse Magician": 1700 → 2700 ATK). The effect of "Cyberse Magician" halves any damage Playmaker takes. The attack continues and "Cyberse Magician" is not destroyed (Playmaker: 3450 → 1550 LP).
 "Cyberse Magician" attacks "Hydradrive Lord". During damage calculation, as the equipped "Cyberse Magician" is attacking a monster with higher ATK, Playmaker activates the effect of "Resume Mace", sending it to the GY to double the original ATK of the monster it was equipped to, until the end of the Battle Phase ("Cyberse Magician": 1700 → 4200 ATK). During damage calculation, the effects of "Judgment Arrows" and "Cyberse Magician" apply ("Hydradrive Lord": 2300 → 4600 ATK, "Cyberse Magician": 4200 → 5200 ATK). As the equipped "Cyberse Magician" is attacking Bohman's monster, Playmaker activates the effect of "Suspend Wand", sending it to the GY to make the monster it was equipped to gain ATK equal to the total battle damage Playmaker took this turn from battles involving the equipped monster, until the end of Bohman's turn ("Cyberse Magician": 5200 → 6000 → 7900 ATK). The attack continues and "Hydradrive Lord" is destroyed (Bohman: 4000 → 700 LP). As Bohman took battle damage, he activates his face-down Continuous Trap Card "Property Flash", placing a Property Counter on it for every 1000 damage he took, then ending the Battle Phase. Bohman takes 3300 damage, so he places 3 Property Counters on it ("Property Flash": 0 → 3 Property Counters).
 Duel continues in the next episode .
