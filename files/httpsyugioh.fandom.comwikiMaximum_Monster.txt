 Maximum Monster  (マキシマムモンスター  Makishimamu Monsutā ) is a type of  Monster Card . They first appeared in the  Yu-Gi-Oh! SEVENS  anime.
 A Maximum Monster is a subtype of a monster that has different parts to be summoned together. It also has Maximum ATK, where it replaces the original ATK, when all the parts of the Maximum Monster are in the field. Maximum Monsters can also have Continuous Effects, which last while they are on the field.
 When Maximum Summoned, Maximum Monsters are treated as one card, which can only attack once. If used as a tribute, Maximum Summoned Maximum Monster is treated as one monster for that tribute. The opponent can only select the Maximum Summoned Maximum Monster as an attack target, using Maximum ATK for damage calculation. If there is a monster on the side of the field already, it can be removed for a successful Maximum Summon.
 Maximum Summoned Maximum Monsters can be Normal Summoned once on the field, but their special effects - Maximum ATK, treated as only one card, Maximum Mode effects - are not enabled on the field afterwards.
