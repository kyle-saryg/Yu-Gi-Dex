 " Magician " ( 魔 術 師 ,  Majutsushi ) is an  archetype  that consists of both  Spellcaster   monsters  used by  Yuya Sakaki  and  Continuous Spell Cards  used by  Yusho Sakaki  in the  Yu-Gi-Oh! ARC-V  anime. They first debuted in  Starter Deck 2014  with " Stargazer Magician " and " Timegazer Magician ". The archetype is related to the " Odd-Eyes " and " Performapal " archetypes, both of which are also used by Yuya.
 Due to their Japanese names, a number of older cards, such as " Time Wizard " and " Night Wing Sorceress ", also fall into this archetype. Also, several older cards, such as the  "Dark Magician" archetype  and " Magician of Faith ", include "Magician" in their English names but are not part of this archetype. However, because  TCG  and  OCG  support for this archetype only works on  Pendulum Monsters  and Continuous Spell Cards, neither have been an issue in the English version. In the Italian version, the inclusion of  female   Pendulum Monsters  such as " Harmonizing Magician ", " Nobledragon Magician ", " White Wing Magician " and " Xiangsheng Magician " seems to be implicit because their names don't contain "Mago".

 Members 
 Pairs 
 Some "Magician"  Pendulum Monsters  are paired, with each member of a pair having the same naming scheme as the other but representing an opposing concept, and most of the time a  Pendulum Scale  that allows a wide range of  Levels  for monsters to be Pendulum Summoned if placed with it. Additionally, each pair supports a particular  Special Summoning  method.

 Z-ARC 
 Another group of "Magician" Pendulum Monsters, usually called "Z-ARC Magicians" or "Four Dragon's Magicians", are based on the  Four Dimension Dragons . They are all  Level  4 monsters who each possess both an  Attribute  and a  Pendulum Effect  that mimics their respective Dragon's  effect  at the cost of  destroying  themselves, and are always treated as one of those Dragon's  archetype . They can also Summon their corresponding Dragon by using themselves and another appropriate monster as  Material . In tandem with " Supreme King Dragon Darkwurm ", they can also Summon the " Supreme King Dragon " counterparts.
 The Pendulum Effects for the Scale 1 members are  Trigger -based, while the Scale 8 members are  Ignition -based.

 Playing style 
 Opening with " Wisdom-Eye Magician " or " Pendulum Call " is usually second to the many Pendulum cards like " Astrograph Sorcerer " and " Chronograph Sorcerer ", that can easily Special Summon themselves from the Hand and other cards with a similar effect to open up to any generic  Link Monster , or more typically,  Heavymetalfoes Electrumite , opening the Field up and then after all that is over and done with; Pendulum Summon. 
 Pendulum Magicians " Black Fang ", " Double Iris " and " Purple Poison " all have effects in the Pendulum Zone that blow themselves and self-activate their "When Destroyed" effects. This gives a 2 for 1 bonus and "Double Iris" usually adds " Star Pendulumgraph " first; which is also a Searcher but permanent.
 " Xiangke Magician " has the highest ATK of all "Magician" cards, can negate the effect of a LIGHT monster at Instant Speed and with a few other Level 7 Monsters gives access to " Odd-Eyes Raging Dragon  and  Rebellion Dragon ": both having game ending effects.
 
 With " Supreme King Z-ARC " 
 The " Z-ARC Magicians " can also be used in the Deck as their Scales of 1 and 8 are within the normal range of the Magician archetype while being Level 4 at the same time. However they play rather a bit differently than the rest due to having a bigger focus on self-destruction, as well as the " Pendulumgraph " cards, both " Astrograph Sorcerer " and " Chronograph Sorcerer " and finally " Supreme King Z-ARC ". Their monster effect upon destruction also force your opponent to think twice before negating their Summon and destroy them, and thus, protect other Pendulum Summoned monsters. Also, any of your opponent's attempt of negating their effect and destroying the "Z-ARC Magicians" will only backfire as it can be activated again.
 This archetype has been competitively successful for a long period in Yu-Gi-Oh's history, going back to the now-infamous  Performage / Performapal  decks that ruled the post- Nekroz  era with their mass summoning, often using Magician monsters help support their plays, which lead to them taking repeated hits on the banlist. While they faded from the competitive scene in late 2016 with the banning of that Deck, they recovered enough of their cards to come out from  Zoodiac  format as a powerful force, but they initially struggled with the new Link Format. With the release of more generic Link monsters, they emerged as the dominant deck in early 2018. They used Astrograph and Chronograph to repeatedly Summon monsters and search out cards, Double Iris to search Pendulumgraphs, and  Performapal Skullcrobat Joker  to utilise their otherwise near-redundant Normal Summon.
 The Deck was first hit by banning Double Iris and Joker, effectively also banning the Pendulumgraphs as they were now unsearchable, but with  Heavymetalfoes Electrumite  to control the Extra Deck and trigger Astrograph over and over, the deck remained at the top. It even become more dominant as an  FTK  was discovered using  Instant Fusion  to Summon  Lyrilusc - Independent Nightingale  and then summoning 2  Supreme King Dragon Starving Venom  to copy its effect and burn your opponent to death. This lead to both Astrograph and Starving Venom being banned, reducing the deck to a less successful, but no less potent, strategy revolving around repeatedly summoning Chronograph into Electrumite and again and again to amass Link/Synchro/Xyz Materials. This led to Electrumite being Limited and eventually banned, effectively ending this deck as a top-tier strategy, although it remains a powerful lower-tier deck due to its synergy with various other Pendulum engines.
