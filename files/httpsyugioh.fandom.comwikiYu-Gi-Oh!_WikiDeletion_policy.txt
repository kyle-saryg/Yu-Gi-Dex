We strive to catalog everything we can on Yu-Gi-Oh!, but there are limits to what is, and is not acceptable.

 Not Acceptable 
 Unofficial Proxy Card Images 
 We are not to use self-made "fan" images for cards. If an Anime/Manga/Video Game card image isn't available, we do not create one, instead we use an image of the card effect, and if that is unavailable, the card's depicted artwork.
 Fan-Made card articles are not allowed on the main namespace, and we strongly encourage you to use the  Yu-Gi-Oh! Card Maker Wikia .
 
 Incorrect Rulings Pages 
 We're just an easy-to-access Repository for Rulings. We're fine with that, but if a ruling doesn't exist on  Upper Deck Forums ,  Konami  or if a link to the  Konami FAQ  is not given, it will be deleted.

 Silly/Stupid/Unworkable OTKs 
 By their very nature, this is a "Common Sense" policy. A Good or Historic OTK is fair enough, but if one does not work based on TCG or OCG Rules, we don't list it. The only exceptions to this, are ones that has been proven to work using a flaw in a specific Video Game. We also delete on sight OTKs that need more than six cards, and those that need more than one turn to set up.
