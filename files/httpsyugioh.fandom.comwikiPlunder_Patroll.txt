 Design 
 " Plunder Patroll " is based around a classic pirate crew with trolls as the members of the crew, based on pirates and vikings.
 
 Etymology 
 The archetype name is based on plunder and patrol + troll. The Main Deck monsters are based on roles taken by crew members of a ship, whilst the Extra Deck ones are based on ship types. The Spells/Traps contain a pun on the popular pirate phrase "Arrr!".

 Playing style 
 The Plunder Patroll theme's playstyle revolves around summoning archetypal Extra Deck monsters for free during the opponent's turn based on the Attribute of the monsters the opponent controls or are in their GY. Currently, there are 4 boss monsters; a LIGHT Fusion Monster, a FIRE Synchro Monster, a DARK Xyz Monster, and a WATER Link Monster. By doing so, they can equip themselves to the cards and make the discard effects of " Plunder Patrollship Lys " , " Plunder Patrollship Brann " and " Plunder Patrollship Moerk " into Quick Effects. In synergy with this, the Field Spell card, " Plunder Patroll Shipyarrrd ", gives all Plunder Patroll monsters you control 500 ATK for each Plunder Patroll card in your S/T Zone and can set itself from the GY to the field by returning a Plunder Patroll card from your S/T zone to the hand. This not only makes the Field Spell live once more, but also provides fodder for both Patrollships. As well, the Continuous Trap, " Plunder Patroll Booty " provides a means of changing attributes on the field and revival/recycling for the deck, which is useful if you need to recycle the non-properly summoned boss monsters of the deck.
