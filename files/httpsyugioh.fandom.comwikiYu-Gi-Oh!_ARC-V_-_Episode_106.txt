 Summary 
       Declan  returns to the   Standard Dimension  from the  Fusion Dimension 's  Duel Academy .     
 As students happily Duel in the  second You Show Duel School ;  Yusho Sakaki  muses that he sees;  Declan Akaba  is personally leading the  Lancers . He explains that he also left the  Standard Dimension  because of Declan, much to  Zuzu 's surprise.  Alexis  watches from the doorway. Yusho explains that Declan crossed dimensions in order to find  his father  three years ago, and Declan furiously yelling that he wasn't done talking to Leo and asking what he meant by advance and destroy is sown. Leo had claimed that it is all for the purpose of uniting the worlds. Declan was forcibly returned to the Standard Dimension by his father; the dimensional travel device that had sent him back breaking just as his father had promised. He appeared in the grounds of the  Leo Corporation  and looked up at the tower.
 
       Yusho  forces his way into the dimensional transporter to head to the  Fusion Dimension 's  Duel Academy .     
 At night, Declan is shown looking at a screen bearing the words "Standard Dimension", " Fusion Dimension ", " Synchro Dimension " and " Xyz Dimension ", all with streams linking at the center of the screen. Yusho explains that Declan reached a conclusion after investigating the scant amount of research that Leo had left behind. Declan had explained to Yusho that Leo was trying to control the world, divided into  four dimensions , through Dueling. He speaks hesitantly and then with more confidence explains that he removed his father from his position and became the President of Leo Corporation in order to stop Leo's ambitions. He told Yusho that he wanted him to lead the Lancers and help him stop Leo. Yusho explains that Declan conveyed his pain and desires to him and agreed. He could talk with Leo on equal ground since they developed the  ARC System  and  Action Dueling  together, and with that in mind he forced his way to the interdimensional transporter that Declan's research team were working on and used it despite their protests in order to get to  Duel Academy . (In the dub, Yusho clarifies that he agreed to lead the Lancers, and kept his true intentions to talk with Leo a secret.)
 In the present, Zuzu realizes when Yusho did that, and Yusho confirms that it was the day of his championship match against  the Sledgehammer . Zuzu gasps as she remembers  Yuya  vowing that his father would show up, and until then he would be the Sledgehammer's opponent before  Yoko  pulled her son away. She covers her mouth and declares that she has to tell Yuya that Yusho was fighting on his own to save everyone. 
 
       Yusho  remembers  Kite ,  Allen  and  Saya  before the invasion of  Duel Academy .     
 Yusho explains that he didn't arrive in Duel Academy, but in another dimension where he met Duelists who all used  Xyz Monsters , and he taught them that Dueling should be used to bring smiles to everyone. He remembers  Kite ,  Allen  and " Saya  and states that before long Duel Academy launched an attack on  that peaceful city . Yusho suddenly spasms and two girls come in and state that it's time for Yusho's treatments. Yusho agrees and he reaches for his cane. Zuzu moves to help him but Yusho wards her off and allows the girls to escort him away. Zuzu sadly muses that Yusho's leg is injured and Alexis explains that it was because of  Aster  (in the dub, she merely states that it was Duel Academy). Zuzu asks Alexis why Duel Academy is waging the dimensional war, and Alexis explains that the students of Duel Academy fight in order to create a utopia where everyone can live peacefully. Zuzu is surprised at the mention of a utopia and Alexis states that the name of that effort is the  Arc Project . Zuzu repeats the name (in the dub, she says she can't believe it) and Alexis explains that it is the Professor's plan to unite all four dimensions. But in reality…
 
         Aster Phoenix  is declared the Commander-in-Chief of the  Arc Project .     
 Alexis remembers being at Duel Academy; seeing Duel Academy students standing in a cross;  blue-jacketed students  making up the front arm;  red-jacketed students  making up the bottom arm, and  yellow-jacketed students  forming the side arms. She explains that Duel Academy is invading other dimensions in order to control them. A year ago the invasion was announced and Aster selected as the Commander-in-Chief. Alexis herself wasn't selected to participate in the first army, but she intended to march the moment she received the order. She lays out Zuzu's hair clips and a change of clothes and admits that she was confident in her polished Dueling skills intended for the invasion as well. Zuzu listens in the shower and Alexis explains that she's left a change of clothes for Zuzu as well. Zuzu thanks Alexis and Alexis tells her to take her time. (The scene in the present is cut from the dub.)
 
         A woman with purple hair begs  Alexis  to flee from  Duel Academy  along with her.     
 As she walks away she remembers being told that the first army, their heroes, had returned home. Four students in red jackets conversed with each other; one asking how many people they  turned into cards . The student replied that they got 25; the first student replied that he got 30 and laughed that he won. A third student comments that it was pretty fun, and felt just like a hunting game, while a fourth claims that he can't wait for the next deployment order. Off to the side, Alexis talked with a purple-haired girl in a red jacket and asked her what was wrong; everyone else was so cheerful and they were laughing. The purple-haired girl claimed that there was no way that she could laugh after they did those things. Two students resembling  Zane Truesdale  and  Bastion Misawa  walked past jovially, and Alexis asked "those things" after they were out of earshot. The girl explained that they turned people into cards. Alexis pointed out that it was a battle so there was no avoiding it. Sometimes doing the right thing involves making sacrifices; she's sure that the enemy Duelists tried their hardest too (Alexis' statement is cut from the dub). But the girl protested that it wasn't just Duelists, to Alexis's surprise. The girl explains that they received order on the battlefield; in order to gain total control over the Xyz Dimension they had to turn everyone, including the civilians, into cards. They turned defenceless people; woman, children, even the elderly, into cards. Was that really the right thing to do? Alexis was floored by the orders and the girl protested that she didn't want to be involved in that again before embracing Alexis and encouraging her to run away with her. She explained that she didn't want Alexis to do those awful things either.
 
         Yusho Sakaki  saves  Alexis  from  Duel Academy 's  Juvenile Officers .     
 Alexis had faith in Duel Academy and the Professor, and thought that uniting the four dimensions as part of the Arc Project was something wonderful. She left Duel Academy with the girl on a speedboat, thinking that she could convince the girl (in the dub, Alexis admits to herself that she knew in her heart that the girl was telling the truth), but they were ambushed by  Juvenile Officers  the moment they stepped onto shore. The Officers shone spotlights on them from " Armor Canine - Bullcopters " and told them that even if they lacked loyalty they could still contribute to the Arc Project. Alexis asked what they meant, and the purple-haired girl rushed forwards, telling Alexis to stand back. But the Officers immediately sealed her into a card, much to Alexis's horror. " Performapal Sky Magician " then appeared and destroyed the "Bull Copters", alerting Alexis. It then blasted the three Juvenile Officers into the sea, before disappearing as Yusho stood there, wearing an Xyz Dimension  Duel Disk .
 
         Zuzu  returns from showering, in a new outift.     
 Zuzu observes that that must have been when Alexis met Yusho. She walks into the room, newly clothed and toweling her hair off. Alexis explains that Yusho collapsed immediately afterwards, and Zuzu asks if Aster injured Yusho (Aster isn't mentioned in the dub) and Alexis replies that he did, and Yusho was sent across dimensions afterwards. Yusho told Alexis a lot of things, like what happened in the Xyz Dimension. She explains that every child at You Show Duel School had been sent to the Xyz Dimension and all bear scars in their hearts. Alexis claims that she wants to teach them all about Yusho's ideals to make people smile through Dueling, so she formed You Show Duel School with Yusho. Her dream is to help as many of her comrades as she can escape from Duel Academy, and eventually even Duel Academy will… Zuzu interrupts, vowing that she'll help Alexis achieve her dream. Two students, a boy and a girl, suddenly run in supporting another girl, declaring that they've got trouble. Alexis asks what's wrong as the students lower the girl to the ground and the male student explains that they were discovered by Duel Academy while trying to protect the girl. The girl gasps that their comrades are in danger.
 
         Yuri  faces of against five  You Show  students.     
 The five endangered You Show students stand in the harbor, facing off against  Yuri . Yuri holds a card containing another student and the five students look at him furiously as Yuri calls their friendship beautiful for staying to avenge their comrade instead of fleeing, but he's sure that they're going to regret this. He comments that it's no matter (in the dub, he says he's ready to "write the final chapter in their story" and asks if they're ready to have fun); he's been ordered to turn everyone who opposes Duel Academy into cards after all. He flicks the card into the ground and suggests that the students give it everything they've got; after all Yuri is just killing time here (in the dub, he actually claims the opposite, taking them on all at once because his time is precious). The students are surprised and Yuri activates his Duel Disk, suggesting that they have some fun. All six Duelists declare, "DUEL!"
 Yuri takes the first turn, Summoning " Predaplant Squid Drosera ". Then he activates a  Continuous Spell Card , " Predator Planter ", which allows him to  Special Summon  a " Predaplant " from his hand with its effect negated, and he Special Summons " Predaplant Moray Nepenthes ". Since everyone is unable to attack on the first turn, Yuri ends his turn (in the dub, Yuri comments that he hopes his opponents Summon some tasty monsters for his "Predaplants" to munch on; they're famished). 
 
         Yuri  laughs hysterically at the idea of a Duel with smiles, mocking the beliefs of  You Show .     
 One of the You Show students, a thin boy with spiky teal hair, steps forwards, declares his turn, and draws. He activates the  Spell Card  " Polymerization " from his hand,  fusing  " Steamroid ", " Drillroid ", and " Submarineroid " from his hand to  Fusion Summon  " Super Vehicroid Jumbo Drill ". Yuri observes that the boy is a traitor that deserted Duel Academy, but he still shamelessly brought out a  Fusion Monster . (In the dub, Yuri actually offers the boy the chance to return to Duel Academy.) The boy tells Yuri to shut up; Duel Academy are the ones who should be ashamed. He doesn't want to use Dueling to make people sad anymore, but has sworn to use Dueling to do the right thing. Yuri is confused by the statement and the teal-haired student states that true Dueling should be used to bring smiles to everyone, and he ends his turn with that. But Yuri's reaction at hearing this is to burst out laughing, protesting that there's no way that would work out since a Duel is a battle and only the winner gets to smile. He continues to laugh until the sole female student declares that their teacher said that true Dueling is supposed to bring smiles to both winners and losers and even the spectators as well. She declares her turn and draws, then activates "Polymerization" to fuse " Big Koala " and " Des Kangaroo " from her hand to Fusion Summon " Master of Oz ". She declares that Dueling has the power to bring smiles to everyone and ends her turn. Yuri casually comments that in that case she'd better smile when he seals her into a card; he isn't planning to lose after all. The third student, a dark blue-haired boy, tells Yuri not to be delusional and he asks how Yuri is supposed to win a five-on-one match.
 
         The effect of " Ojama King " blocks  Yuri 's Monster Zones with  Ojamas .     
 He declares his turn and draws " Foolish Burial ", which he adds to his hand that already contains " Ojama Yellow ", " Ojama Green ", " Ojama Black ", "Polymerization" and " Flash Fusion ". He activates "Polymerization", fusing "Ojama Yellow", "Ojama Green" and "Ojama Black" in his hand to Fusion Summon " Ojama King ", which he Summons in  Defense Position . Yuri's eyes widen and he bursts out laughing, asking what on earth "Ojama King" is (in the dub, he jokes that that monster needs a towel). The student comments that Yuri is laughing, and he explains that the effect of "Ojama King" will prevent Yuri from using three of his  Monster Zones . Three red "X"s appear between Yuri's monsters and the " Ojama Trio " appear in them leering at Yuri, who disgustingly comments that "Ojama King" is unpleasant in terms of both appearance and effect (in the dub, he says his opponent will be crying when this is over). The blue-haired student ends his turn.
 
         One of the students successfully Summons all three  X   Y  and  Z  monsters.     
 The fourth student, a ginger-haired boy, turns to a blonde boy and they encourage one another to go. The ginger student draws and Summons " V-Tiger Jet ". Then he activates the Continuous Spell Card, " Frontline Base " to Special Summon " W-Wing Catapult " from his hand. Yuri asks if the boy isn't going to use a Fusion card and the boy smiles and claims that even if he doesn't use one he can still Fusion Summon. He  banishes  "V-Tiger Jet" and "W-Wing Catapult" from his field to Fusion Summon " VW-Tiger Catapult ". Yuri is impressed that there are people who can use  Contact Fusion  (though he does not name it as such) and comments that the boy is much more interesting than the last guy, much to the Ojama Duelist's chagrin (in the dub, Yuri doesn't take a shot at the Ojama Duelist). The ginger-haired boy tells Yuri to laugh while he can and  Sets  a card to end his turn. The blonde student declares his turn and draws, then he Summons " X-Head Cannon ". He also activates "Frontline Base", using its effect to Special Summon " Y-Dragon Head " from his hand. Then he activates the Spell Card "Foolish Burial", sending " Z-Metal Tank " from his Deck to the  Graveyard . Next he activates " Iron Call ", which lets him Special Summon the "Z-Metal Tank" that he sent to the Graveyard with its effects negated. He explains that now he has all X, Y and Z monsters on his field, and banishes all three of them to Fusion Summon " XYZ-Dragon Cannon ". Electricity sparks between the three monsters, which join together as "Y-Dragon Head" sheds its wings and folds its legs. Yuri admits that the blonde student isn't half bad either; there's a big difference compared to that other guy (in the dub, he simply comments that they saved the best for last). The Ojama Duelist is annoyed, but the blonde Duelist warns Yuri that his banters end here. He activates the effect of "XYZ-Dragon Cannon", discarding another copy of "Y-Dragon Head" to destroy "Moray Nepenthes". Yuri lightly comments that he thought that he'd be safe since no one can attack on the first turn, but his opponent got him with an effect. 
 The ginger-haired student tells Yuri that there's more; he and his brother will show Yuri their true power. The brothers exchange nods and the ginger-haired brother activates the  Trap Card  " Fellow's Gift ", giving control of "VW-Tiger Catapult" to his brother. His younger brother thanks him and then banishes "VW-Tiger Catapult" and "XYZ-Dragon Cannon" to Fusion Summon " VWXYZ-Dragon Catapult Cannon ". "Z-Metal Tank" and "W-Wing Catapult" detach from their other monsters, "Z-Metal Tank" taking the wings of "Y-Dragon Head" with it, and "W-Wing Catapult" splits into legs, while the body of "Z-Metal Tank" attaches to the back of "X-Head Cannon" and "X-Head Cannon" grabs the back cannons of the treads of "Z-Metal Tank". "V-Tiger Jet" then attaches to the head of "X-Head Cannon" to complete the monster. Yuri praises the siblings and comments that they are really in synch with one another (in the dub, he calls the monster a toy robot). The younger brother activates the effect of "VWXYZ-Dragon Catapult Cannon", banishing a card his opponent controls once per turn. He banishes "Squid Drosera" and asks Yuri how that is; he's lost all of his monsters. But Yuri just laughs and he activates the effect of "Squid Drosera" since it left the field, placing a  Predator Counter  on all Special Summoned monsters his opponent controls. Four green mouths appear and sink their teeth into the four monsters, much to the shock of the You Show students. Yuri encourages the blonde student to end his turn; it's Yuri's turn to have some fun. The younger brother warily does so (in the dub, he claims that they aren't scared of Yuri).
 
         The  ATK  of " Starving Venom Fusion Dragon " rises to 13000.     
 Yuri comments that then he'll go. He draws a card and then he pays 800  LP  for the cost of his "Predator Planter" Continuous Spell Card. Then he activates its effect to Special Summon "Moray Nepenthes" from his Graveyard with its effects negated. He adds the card that he drew to his hand and Summons " Predaplant Flytrap ". Yuri comments that it's finally his turn and he licks his lips (the part where he licks his lips is cut from the dub), to the You Show students' fear. Yuri activates his own "Polymerization", fusing "Predaplant Flytrap" and "Predaplant Moray Nepenthes" from his field, and he chants, "Two beautiful flowers with a deadly alluring fragrance! Become one and create a new terror from the hell that lies beneath your petals! Fusion Summon! Appear now! Poisonous dragon with hungering fangs!  Level 8 !  Starving Venom Fusion Dragon ! ((dub) "With the power of  Polymerization , I fuse  Nepenthes  and  Flytrap  in order to bring out the most toxic Monster ever seen! I promise, you'll never look at greenery the same way again! I Fusion Summon! The vicious, voracious, and venomous  Starving Venom Fusion Dragon !")" The students recoil in horror from the monstrous dragon and Yuri explains that the effect of "Starving Venom Fusion Dragon" will increase its  ATK  by the total value of all Special Summoned monsters his opponent controls, much to the horror of the first three students (in the dub, they collectively realize that they'll be unable to stop it). The fanged mouths on "Starving Venom's" back open, dripping saliva as pink energy rushes into them, bringing "Starving Venom" to  13000  ATK. The older brother repeats the value in shock. 
 
         " Starving Venom " prepares to unleash its final attack.     
 Yuri explains that once per turn, "Starving Venom" can gain the effect of an opposing monster, and he chooses "Super Vehicroid Jumbo Drill". The teal-haired You Show student is surprised that Yuri has chosen his monster, and Yuri cheerfully points out that it can deal  piercing damage  when it attacks after all, and the teal and the blue-haired students both gasp as they realize what Yuri is intending to do. Yuri suggests that they get this started, and start with the older of the two brothers, since he has no monsters, and he orders "Starving Venom" to attack directly. "Starving Venom" spears its tail past the boy, drawing blood and reducing his LP to zero. Then Yuri activates the effect of a second "Predaplant Squid Drosera" from his hand, sending it to the Graveyard to force "Starving Venom" to attack all monsters his opponent controls with Predator Counters since "Starving Venom" itself has just battled. "Starving Venom" opens all four of the mouths on its back and prepares to attack. First, Yuri orders "Starving Venom" to attack "Super Vehicroid Jumbo Drill", and "Starving Venom" opens its back mouths again. The lower left mouth extends on a stem and devours "Jumbo Drill", reducing the teal-haired You Show student's LP to zero. Next Yuri has "Starving Venom" attack "Master of Oz (which, in the dub, he calls a "featherweight")", and "Master of Oz" turns away as the upper right mouth devours it, reducing the female You Show Student to 0 LP. Yuri frowns in displeasure and disdainfully orders "Starving Venom" to attack "Ojama King", who turns tail and runs even as it is snapped up. (in the dub Yuri orders "Starving Venom" to dethrone the pale king.) The piercing effect that "Starving Venom" inherited from "Jumbo Drill" reduces the blue-haired You Show student to 0 LP. Finally, Yuri orders "Starving Venom" to attack "VWXYZ Dragon Catapult Cannon". "Starving Venom" spreads out forks of red and purple lightning and green orbs appear in between them, before blasting both the lightning and a stream of green energy at "VWXYZ-Dragon Catapult Cannon"; the lightning binding "VWXYZ-Dragon Catapult Cannon" before the stream hits. "VWXYZ Dragon Catapult Cannon" is destroyed and the younger brother falls to 0 LP. The holograms disappear and Yuri comments that that was quick. He activates the function of his Duel Disk and transforms all five defeated You Show students into cards. Yuri takes out all five cards and muses that he didn't get to kill a lot of time. 
 Zuzu and Alexis arrive, and Yuri is surprised to see that Zuzu is here as well. Alexis asks if Zuzu knows Yuri, and Zuzu explains that Yuri is the one who chased her in the Standard and  Synchro Dimensions . Yuri comments that it's rude to call him "that guy" (creep in the dub) and he introduces himself; stating that he has a name and it's Yuri, so Zuzu can call him that, calling her by name as well. Alexis steps in front of Zuzu as Yuri advances on them, telling Zuzu he's happy that he ran into her, and he's sure that the Professor will be as well. Yuri hunches as he walks towards them and tells Zuzu to come with him. The girls both step back in apprehension. 
 
         Yugo 's arrival causes  Zuzu's bracelet  to teleport  Yuri  away.     
 Yugo  yells that he won't let Yuri get away this time. Zuzu and Alexis separate as Yugo attempts to ram Yuri with his  Duel Runner , but  Zuzu's bracelet  activates and Yuri is teleported away, Yugo barely managing to skid to a stop at the edge of the harbor. Alexis is shocked that Yuri disappeared. Yugo removes his helmet and he angrily asks where Yuri went. Zuzu gasps Yugo's name and asks why he's here. Yugo repeats the question, as he didn't realize that Zuzu was still alive. He cries Zuzu's name and tearfully runs to embrace her, much to Zuzu and Alexis's surprise, earning Yugo a swat from Zuzu's fan. Alexis is shocked at first, but is soon trying not to laugh. Yugo rubs his head and he admits that he thought for sure that Zuzu had died after  Sergey  sent her flying (in the dub, he apologizes for getting over-excited, but he hadn't seen her for the longest time). Zuzu tells him not to say such ominous stuff and poor Alexis can only wonder what is going on (in the dub, Zuzu snaps that it wasn't long enough, and Alexis comments that Zuzu has some interesting friends). Yugo gets to his feet and he asks if Zuzu has heard; it seems like Duel Academy are here, so  Rin  is here as well. Zuzu replies that it isn't just Rin, but  Lulu  and  Celina  as well. Yugo is surprised to learn that Celina was captured, and Zuzu confirms that she was taken right in front of her and Yuya.
 
         The Professor  sends two new soldiers to  Heartland  to defeat the  Lancers .     
 At Duel Academy, the Professor slouches on his throne as he explains to two subordinates that they received a report from  Mamoru Noro  that Duelists who use  Pendulum Summoning ; the Lancers, have appeared in Heartland. In order for the Arc Project to progress smoothly, they have to be eliminated. He suggests to his audience that they go and take care of it. A  silver-haired woman  comments that the "little blockhead" (in Japanese; "Noroma" translates to blockhead) is obviously too incompetent (they don't mention Mamoru in the dub) while Aster is too lacking in experience. Her  blonde haired companion  agrees and she observes that it looks like their strength is needed after all. The silver haired woman smiles and she comments that this will be fun.

Since "Starving Venom" was Fusion Summoned by only using monsters on the field as Fusion Materials, Yuri activates its effect, increasing the  ATK  of "Starving Venom" by the ATK of all Special Summoned monsters his opponents control (2800 → 13000). Yuri activates the other effect of "Starving Venom", which lets him negate the effects of an opponent's monster and have "Starving Venom" gain the same effects. He negates the effects "Jumbo Drill" and grants its effects to "Starving Venom". "Starving Venom"  attacks  #4  directly  (#4: 4000 → 0).
 Yuri activates the effect of another copy of "Squid Drosera" in his hand, sending it to his Graveyard to force "Starving Venom" to attack all monsters with Predator Counters once each. "Starving Venom" attacks and destroys "Jumbo Drill", "Master of Oz", "Ojama King", and "VWXYZ", with the acquired effect of "Jumbo Drill" inflicting  piercing   battle damage  to You Show student #3 (#1, #2, #3, #5: 4000 → 0).

 Mistakes 
 During  Yuri  and the five  You Show Duel School  students' Duel, all  Duelists  have the old  card backing . 
 In the flashback when  Leo Akaba  places a miniature  teleportation device  on  Declan 's wrist, the device is in his right wrist, but when he arrives in  Standard , the device is on his left wrist. 
 Trivia 
 Declan's position when he return to the Standard is a reference to the scenes in the  Terminator  films where the Terminator antagonist first appears in the current time period in which the films are set, kneeling in a blue energy sphere that dissolves any foreign objects within its radius. 
 In the Japanese version, there are a few changes in Declan's speech pattern that occur during the flashbacks that indicate his character change; he no longer respectfully refers to his father as "otou-san"; instead by the term "chichi-ue", and he switches from using the "boku" personal pronoun to "watashi".
