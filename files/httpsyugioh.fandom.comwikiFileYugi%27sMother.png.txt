 Biography 
 She appeared as cameos when  her father-in-law  was in the hospital due to losing his very spirit to Pegasus' Millennium Eye's ancient mystical abilities. [1] 
 She confronts Yugi with her fears at one point. Not knowing that Yugi was talking to Yami, she assumed that Yugi was talking to himself. As Yugi and Tea left for school, she asked Solomon about it. Solomon assured her Yugi had a lot on his mind, saying that he was the same at his grandson's age. Yugi's mother remarked that was what worried her, angering her father-in-law. (This scene was removed from the English dub.) [2]
