      Titan holding the Pendant     
 The  Millennium Pendant , as  Titan  called it, was a fake version of the  Millennium Puzzle  used by Titan as he pretended to steal people's souls.
 
 Events 
 Using the pendant and other trickery, Titan simulated  Shadow Duels , causing his opponents to legitimately believe that what they experienced was real (in the dub, they were said to be sent to the  Shadow Realm ). He used it against Duelists in the streets and after winning a Duel he would punish them with a fake  Mind Crush . He was later hired by  Dr. Crowler  to scare  Jaden Yuki  away from  Duel Academy . Titan took  Alexis Rhodes  hostage to lure Jaden to the  Abandoned Dorm  to Duel him. [1]  Near the end of the Duel, Jaden, with the aide of  Winged Kuriboh , realized that the pendant was a fake after Titan claimed there were seven  Millennium Puzzles , as opposed to seven  Millennium Items  (in the dub, it was because he called it the Millennium Pendant, instead of the Millennium Puzzle). Jaden threw his " Elemental Hero Avian " card at the pendant, causing it to break. [2]
