      The Four Dimensions. (Click on one of the dimensions to go to its page.)     
 The  Standard Dimension  (スタンダード 次 元   Sutandādo Jigen ) is one of the  Four Dimensions , as well as the primary setting of  Yu-Gi-Oh! ARC-V . It is the home dimension of  Yuya Sakaki  and his friends. According to  Yuto , the other three dimensions revolve around the Standard Dimension. In contrast to the  Fusion ,  Synchro , and  Xyz Dimensions , this dimension did not have its own type of  Extra Deck  Summon originally. [1]  Such Summons were initially not present in the dimension, and eventually taught only at the  Leo Institute of Dueling  in  Paradise City . [2] [3]  Recently, however, an  anomaly  gave Standard its own summoning method, the  Pendulum Summon . Hence, unlike other dimensions, this dimension is not named by its summoning method, nor has its summoning method available to most of its Duelists. This is the only one of the Four Dimensions that does not feature an alternate universe version of any past character of the  Yu-Gi-Oh!  franchise. 
 The people of Standard are unaware of the upgraded versions of the Extra Deck methods used in the other dimensions such as  Rank-Up Xyz Evolution [4] ,  Double Tuning [5]  and  Contact Fusion [6] , as well as some types of monsters such as  Tuner Synchro Monsters [7] , and other Duel variations such as  Turbo Duels [8]  (including the  Duel Runner [9] ).
 After  Z-ARC 's defeat, the Standard Dimension was reborn as the  Pendulum Dimension  (ペンデュラム 次 元   Pendyuramu Jigen ), with all of its residents capable of Pendulum Summoning normally as well as most of its residents left with no memories of both  Zuzu Boyle 's existence and everything that happened since the  Arc League Championship . [10]  It also doesn't seem to behave like the other dimensions where other summoning methods are foreign to them, as  Gong  was still able to Synchro Summon. [11] 
 The "everyman" of the Pendulum Dimension seems to be fairly more attuned to the supernatural than those of the Standard Dimension, as everyone in the audience instantly remembered the events of the ARC League Championship after little more than a few words from  Moon Shadow . [12]  Also, when Yuya remembered that he is Z-ARC and laments over it, they instantly knew what he was talking about despite having no involvement in the final battle. [11]
