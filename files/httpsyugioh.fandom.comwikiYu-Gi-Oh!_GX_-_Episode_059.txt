 Summary 
 Aster Phoenix  unveils his  Destiny Heroes  and  Jaden Yuki 's  Elemental Heroes  can't seem to compete. Despite the "Destiny Heroes" relatively low attack points, their  effects  push Jaden into a corner, as Aster uses " Misfortune " to deal damage while continuing to place  Clock Counters  on " Clock Tower Prison ". On the turn that the fourth Clock Counter is placed, Jaden would be able to deal enough damage to win. However, "Clock Tower Prison" renders Aster immune to Battle damage when it has enough Counters. Jaden plays " Fusion Gate " and because "Clock Tower Prison" was  destroyed , Aster can Summon his ultimate  monster  - " Destiny Hero - Dreadmaster ", whose attack points are equal to the sum of the attack points of the other "Destiny Heroes" on the  Field .
 
       Jaden  passes out after being defeated by  Aster .     
 Aster explains his past:  His father  was a card designer for  Industrial Illusions , who designed the "Destiny Heroes" himself. One day, Aster came home to find his father dead (kidnapped in the English version). The person who did it also took one of the "Destiny Hero" cards, which was known to be the  most powerful  among them. Aster's vigilante activity is centered around stopping crime to find the person who took his father from him, as he would be able to identify them by their possession of the stolen card. Jaden protests, saying that his father created the Destiny Heroes for fun, not for revenge. His "Dreadmaster" blocks the effect of Jaden's " Elemental Hero Thunder Giant " and wins Aster the Duel with its attack. Jaden falls to the ground, his cards flying about, and they turn blank as he falls.
 
 
 Featured Duel: Aster Phoenix vs. Jaden Yuki 
 Duel continues from  the previous episode .
 Aster has 1800 LP remaining and controls " Destiny Hero - Doom Lord " (600/800) in Attack Position and " Clock Tower Prison ".
 Jaden has 2800 LP remaining and controls no cards.
 Turn 7: Aster 
Aster then Sets a card.
 Turn 8: Jaden 
Jaden draws "Wroughtweiler". During the  Standby Phase , "Clock Tower Prison" gains a  Clock Counter . Jaden then Normal Summons " Wroughtweiler " (800/1200) in  Attack Position . "Wroughtweiler" attacks and destroys "Doom Lord" (Aster 1800 → 1600). Aster then activates his face-down " Destiny Signal " to Special Summon " Captain Tenacious " (800/800) from his Deck in Attack Position.
 Turn 9: Aster 
Aster draws. During Aster's  Standby Phase , he activates the effect of "Captain Tenacious" to revive " Doom Lord " (600/800) in Attack Position since it was destroyed in battle last turn. Aster  Normal Summons  " Destiny Hero - Diamond Dude " (1400/1600) in Attack Position. Aster then activates the effect of "Diamond Dude" to reveal the top card of his  Deck . If that card is a  Normal Spell Card , it will be sent to the Graveyard, and Aster can  activate  its effect on his next turn's Main Phase. He reveals " Misfortune ", so the latter is sent to the Graveyard. "Diamond Dude"  attacks  and  destroys  "Wroughtweiler" (Jaden 2800 → 2200). Since "Wroughtweiler" was destroyed, its effect activates, allowing Jaden to add " Polymerization " and " Bubbleman " from his Graveyard to his hand. "Captain Tenacious" attacks  directly  (Jaden 2200 → 1400). Aster  Sets  a card.
 Turn 10: Jaden 
Jaden draws. During the Standby Phase, "Clock Tower Prison" gains a Clock Counter. It now has a total of two. Jaden then Normal Summons "Elemental Hero Bubbleman" (800/1200) in Attack Position. Since Jaden summoned "Bubbleman" while he had no other cards on his side of the field, its second effect activates, allowing Jaden to  draw  two cards. [Notes 1]  Jaden then activates " Bubble Blaster ", equipping it to "Bubbleman" and increasing its ATK by 800 ("Bubbleman": 800 → 1600/1200). "Bubbleman" attacks "Captain Tenacious", but Aster activates his face-down " D - Shield ", equipping it to "Captain Tenacious" and switching it to  Defense Position . Due to the last effect of "D - Shield", "Captain Tenacious" can't be  destroyed in battle .
 Turn 11: Aster 
Aster draws. During the  Standby Phase , the final effect of "Destiny Hero - Doom Lord" activates, returning " Elemental Hero Shining Flare Wingman " (2500 → 3400/2100) from the  Removed from Play Zone  in Attack Position. Through the effect of "Destiny Hero - Diamond Dude", Aster activates the effect of "Misfortune", targeting "Elemental Hero Shining Flare Wingman" and inflicting damage to Jaden equal to half the  Original ATK  of "Shining Flare Wingman" (Jaden 1400 → 150), but none of Aster's monsters will be allowed to attack this turn. Aster then activates the effect of "Destiny Hero - Doom Lord" to remove "Shining Flare Wingman" from play for two turns.
 Turn 12: Jaden 
Jaden draws. During the  Standby Phase , "Clock Tower Prison" gains a Clock Counter. It now has a total of three. "Bubbleman" attacks and destroys "Doom Lord" (Aster 1600 → 600). Jaden then Normal Summons " Elemental Hero Clayman " (800/2000) in Defense Position.
 Turn 13: Aster 
Aster draws. On Aster's Standby Phase, he activates the effect of "Captain Tenacious" to Special Summon "Doom Lord" (600/800) from the Graveyard in Attack Position. Aster then activates the effect of "Diamond Dude" and he reveals his top card to be " Magical Stone Excavation ", so it is sent to the  Graveyard . Aster then activates the effect of "Destiny Hero - Doom Lord" to remove "Bubbleman" from play for two turns. On Aster's second Standby Phase after the activation of this effect, he can return the removed monster back to the field in the same battle position it was in when removed. Aster then activates " Ring of Magnetism ", equipping it to "Captain Tenacious" and decreasing its ATK and DEF by 500 ("Captain Tenacious": 800 → 300/800 → 300). Now all of Jaden's attacks will be redirected to "Captain Tenacious".
 Turn 14: Jaden 
Jaden draws "Elemental Hero Wildheart". During the Standby Phase, "Clock Tower Prison" gains a Clock Counter. It now has a total of four. Jaden's hand contains "Burial from a Different Dimension", "De-Fusion", "Elemental Hero Necroshade", and "Polymerization". Jaden activates "Polymerization" to fuse " Elemental Hero Wildheart " and " Elemental Hero Necroshade " together and  Fusion Summon  " Elemental Hero Necroid Shaman " (1900/1800) in Attack Position. Since "Necroid Shaman" was  Special Summoned , its effect activates, allowing Jaden to send "Captain Tenacious" to the Graveyard and Special Summon " Elemental Hero Avian " (1000/1000)  from Aster's Graveyard  to his side of the field in Attack Position. "Necroid Shaman" attacks and destroys "Doom Lord", but Aster takes no  Battle Damage  due to "Clock Tower Prison" having at least four Clock Counters. Jaden  Sets  two cards.
 Turn 15: Aster 
Aster draws. During the  Standby Phase , the final effect of "Destiny Hero - Doom Lord" activates, returning "Shining Flare Wingman" (2500 → 4000/2100) from the Removed from Play Zone in Attack Position. Through the effect of "Diamond Dude", Aster activates the effect of "Magical Stone Excavation",  discarding  " Fusion Sage " and " Terraforming " to add "Misfortune" from his Graveyard to his hand. [Notes 2] 
 Aster then activates "Misfortune" and targets "Shining Flare Wingman" for its effect, but Jaden  activates  his face-down " De-Fusion " and  chains  his face-down " Burial from a Different Dimension ". "Burial from a Different Dimension" allows Jaden to return " Elemental Hero Flame Wingman " and " Elemental Hero Sparkman " from the Removed from Play Zone to the Graveyard. "De-Fusion" resolves next, returning "Shining Flare Wingman" to the Fusion Deck and reviving "Flame Wingman" (2100/1200) and "Sparkman" (1600/1400) in Attack Position. Since "Shining Flare Wingman" was removed from the field, "Misfortune" resolves with no effect.
 Turn 16: Jaden 
Jaden draws " Fusion Gate " and subsequently activates it, destroying "Clock Tower Prison". Now both players can  Fusion Summon  without using "Polymerization", but the  Fusion Material Monsters  will be removed from play instead of being sent to the Graveyard. Since "Clock Tower Prison" was destroyed while it had four Clock Counters, its final effect activates, allowing Aster to Special Summon " Destiny Hero - Dreadmaster " (?/?) from his Deck in Attack Position. Since "Dreadmaster" was summoned, its first effect activates, destroying all of Aster's non-" Destiny Hero " monsters and  Special Summoning  Destiny Heroes "Doom Lord" (600/800) and "Captain Tenacious" (800/800) from the Graveyard in Attack Position. Due to the final effect of "Destiny Hero - Dreadmaster", its  original ATK and DEF  are both equal to the sum of the ATK of all other  face-up  " Destiny Hero " monsters Aster controls ("Dreadmaster": ? → 2800/? → 2800).
 
       Aster prepares to end the Duel and summons  Destiny HERO - Dreadmaster     Jaden then uses the effect of "Fusion Gate" to fuse "Clayman" and "Sparkman" together and Fusion Summon " Elemental Hero Thunder Giant " (2400/1500) in Attack Position. Since "Thunder Giant" was Fusion Summoned, its effect activates, allowing Jaden to destroy "Diamond Dude" [Notes 3] , but since "Destiny Hero - Dreadmaster" was Special Summoned via "Clock Tower Prison", none of Aster's face-up "Destiny Hero" monsters can be destroyed this turn and Aster takes no  Battle Damage  when they battle.
 Turn 17: Aster 
 
       Aster defeats Jaden.     
 Aster draws. "Dreadmaster" attacks and destroys "Thunder Giant" (Jaden 150 → 0).
 
 Differences in adaptations 
 In the Japanese version,  Aster 's  father  is killed by the man who steals the card he made. Aster is actually shown to find his body on the floor, with the remaining " Destiny Heroes " scattered around him. In the English version, the body is not there, and Aster states his father was kidnapped.
 
 Errors 
 In the dub, when Aster uses " Magical Excavation " to get " Misfortune " back in his  hand , the shot of "Misfortune" leaving the  Graveyard  shows the artwork for " Polymerization " instead. 
 Just before  Jaden  Summons " Elemental Hero Necroid Shaman ", a shot of his hand is shown. The " Elemental Hero Necroshade " and " Burial from a Different Dimension " that were originally present are changed to " Terrorking Archfiend " and " Diffusion Wave-Motion " in the English version. Despite this, Jaden immediately activates the effect of the "Necroshade" that should have been in the Graveyard. Later, when "Burial from a Different Dimension" is activated, the English version mistakenly shows the artwork for " The Second Sarcophagus " instead. 
 In the dub near the end of the  Duel  when Aster decries about Dueling to punish wrongdoers, we see a cross-section view of the Dueling arena.  Aster at that time has  Destiny Heroes  " Diamond Dude ," " Captain Tenacious ," " Doom Lord " and " Dreadmaster " on the  field .  From this angle all of these monsters  except  "Captain Tenacious" are visible; "Captain Tenacious" cannot be seen at all. 
 During the  Standby Phase  of Aster's last turn, the final effect of "Doom Lord" should have activated, returning " Bubbleman " to Jaden's side of the field. But due to unexplained reasons, it didn't. 
 As Jaden's Deck falls to the ground and close-up shots of some of the cards are shown, the " Dark Catapulter " present in the Japanese version is changed to " Yellow Gadget " in the dub. 
 " Hero Kid " is shown as a Normal Monster and " Mispolymerization " is the wrong card as it goes against the design of Jaden's Deck.

 Notes 
 
 ↑   In the TCG/OCG, the  effect  of " Elemental Hero Bubbleman " only  activates  when he is the only card in your  hand  and on your side of the  Field  when he is Summoned. 
 
 ↑   In the TCG/OCG, cards activated through " Destiny Hero - Diamond Dude 's" effect ignore any  costs  associated with them, so Aster would not have had to discard 2 cards for the effect of " Magical Stone Excavation ". 
 
 ↑   In the TCG/OCG, one must discard a card to activate " Elemental Hero Thunder Giant 's" effect. 
 
 ↑  4.00   4.01   4.02   4.03   4.04   4.05   4.06   4.07   4.08   4.09   4.10   This card can be seen in the air at the end of the episode. 
 
 ↑   This card can be seen on the bottom of  Aster 's  Deck . In the dub, it shown to be " D - Shield ".
