 Gender? 
 What gender is III? In some places, III is a female, whilst in others, he/she is a male...  TheScarecrow14  ( talk  •  contribs ) 13:39, November 27, 2011 (UTC)
 
 Third sibling: III (Three) -- 15 years old. He has a gentle personality and loves his family. While also swearing revenge, he is more worried about the family's fate. VA: 池田恭祐 ikeda kyousuke
 
 This forum segment from  NeoArkCradle  is a translation of a text published in V-Jump magazine, and its regards III as a male. In addition, his VA  Kyōsuke Ikeda  is male too. Therefore, I'd say he's male. -- 109.92.120.126  ( talk ) 13:55, November 27, 2011 (UTC)
 
 Although I'm guessing III's male too, I should point out that Japanese uses pronouns less frequently than English. Sometimes when translating Japanese to English, it's necessary to add pronouns for the sentence to be grammatically correct. So "he" and "his" might have only been added by the translator on that forum, while the original text referenced no gender. You'd need to look at the Japanese text rather than the translation to see if there's any indication of a gender. --  Deltaneos  ( talk ) 17:00, November 27, 2011 (UTC) 
 I am quiet sure he is male since he uses the pronoun Boku when talking about himself. Also Yuma said in the preview for Ep 33 that III is IV ototou which is the japanese word for younger brother. If III would be a girl he would have said imotou meaning younger sister  —This unsigned comment was made by  79.229.33.62  ( talk  •  contribs ) 19:08, March 7, 2012 
 III is a male, because he is seen Naked in episode 49, and he has a flat chest. he is also seen naked in episode 50. so it is pretty clear that he is a male.
 
 Killed Astral? 
 How do we know he really killed Astral? All we know is that he just disappeared, right? Correct me if I'm wrong. -- Novafan365, master of scrap  ( talk  •  contribs ) 17:52, March 4, 2012 (UTC)
 
 Normally Astral when loses against a user with numbers he tends to disappear but killed i think its just for the tittle.-- Nexus   Shiker ( Talk ) 17:55, March 4, 2012 (UTC) 
 III goes to school? 
 in episode 60, in the ending "wild child". the scene where they are in school, at about 0:53. III can be seen in the background, behind Kotori. wearing Yuma's school uniform. does that mean III will be going to school?
 
 Dub Name? 
 Has it been stated somewhere that his dub name is Tres, or is everyone just going off of IV's name being Quatro? Because if its the latter, it is definitely wrong, because Quatro isn't spanish but Italian and is being mistaken for their word for four, cuatro. If all three of the Arclight brothers will have similar dub names, that III's should instaed be Tre, the itallian word for three.
 Ideed they have similar dub names, but not in italian: Tres, quatro and cinco are portuguese numerals. —This unsigned comment was made by  187.123.81.34   ( talk  •  contribs ) 14:38, 28 August 2012 
 
 Not every numeral. Tres is Spanish, because if it would be Portuguese it would be: "Três". -- E. G.G.  ( My Contributions ) 13:45, August 28, 2012 (UTC) 
 Fine. But still, have these names actually be confirmed anywhere? Becuase it seems like everyone is just jumping the gun. For all we know, they could go with number names from multiple different languages.
 Maybe not: They may have been using the same language all along because of the way they pronounce
 Does anybody know what "trey" means in another language? It says on the page it means '3' in Spanish but I know that isn't true, as 3 is 'tres' in Spanish.  Neos01  ( talk  •  contribs ) 20:05, October 14, 2012 (UTC)
 
 It used to say  Tres means "three" , but after the page got renamed someone  replaced all instances  of "Tres" with "Trey", possibly with an autoreplace. I probably would have made the same mistake myself. In English, trey is used to mean 3 in playing cards or a score of three in dice, card or domino games. It's not the word for three in any other languages as far as I can tell, but if you are convinced it is coming from another language, I would say they are basing it on the word "tres". --  Deltaneos  ( talk ) 20:38, October 14, 2012 (UTC) 
 Ah I see. That makes more sense. I didn't know that 'trey' was an english word. I just thought it might have been from another language because the Tron family dub names (save for vetrix) seem to derive from numbers in different languages other than english.  Neos01  ( talk  •  contribs ) 20:57, October 14, 2012 (UTC) 
 Real Name 
 I know that you're probably going off of pronunciation, but do you think maybe the name is suppose to be Micheal and that is just how it is pronounce in Japanese? -- 74.5.132.140  ( talk ) 23:35, September 17, 2012 (UTC)
 
 I wonder the same thing. -- Golden Key  ( talk  •  contribs ) 23:51, September 17, 2012 (UTC) 
 Seems very likely, considering his brothers are Christopher and Thomas. Michael fits in with that much better.  Cheesedude  ( talk  •  contribs ) 00:51, September 18, 2012 (UTC) 
 According to NeoArkadia, both "Michael" and "Mikhail" are accurate. Michael fits more with the rest, so I think that's the better option.  Cheesedude  ( talk  •  contribs ) 00:59, September 18, 2012 (UTC) 
 How do we know it's not Mihael, considering there's no instance of K in the kana at all?  Adreus  ( talk  •  contribs ) 14:54, October 27, 2013 (UTC) 
 We don't. It could also be that. Cheesedude  ( talk  •  contribs ) 18:58, October 27, 2013 (UTC) 
 Wouldn't you think it more likely than the other two?  Adreus  ( talk  •  contribs ) 19:03, October 27, 2013 (UTC) 
 Not really. Michael seems most likely to me. "Michael", "Thomas" and "Christopher" are about the most generic Western names for males there are besides "John". I believe that was the entire point of giving them those names. To a Japanese viewer, it would clearly mark them as characters who are not from Japan. "Mihael" and "Mikhail" wouldn't really hold the same connotation.  Cheesedude  ( talk  •  contribs ) 19:08, October 27, 2013 (UTC) 
 ...That's a little... Sorry, but just because "Mihael" sounds more pleasing to your ear together with "Thomas" and "Christopher" doesn't make it any less likely. Perhaps it's more likely in your location to encounter "Michael" with the other two, but "Mihael" is a European name, too. It isn't Japanese. The fact is that it's just as foreign as "Mikhail" and "Michael"--both of which would be written with different kana  and  pronounced very differently--making the connotation exactly the same.  Adreus  ( talk  •  contribs ) 19:26, October 27, 2013 (UTC) 
 Part of the argument is that all three names are valid and we don't know which was intended, yes? In a case like that, we use context to pick one, or we just list all three. Context points to "Michael" from what I can see. I never said "Mihael" was Japanese, I just said "Michael" was more obviously Western.  Cheesedude  ( talk  •  contribs ) 19:44, October 27, 2013 (UTC) 
 You didn't, that's true. Although I have a problem with "Michael" being 'more obviously Western.' That aside, I still argue that "Mihael" is most likely out of the three because of the spelling and pronunciation in-show (the reason I bring this up today is because of last night's broadcast).  Adreus  ( talk  •  contribs ) 19:47, October 27, 2013 (UTC) 
 "Michael" is more commonly used overall, I think (I could be wrong). "Christian" is equally Western, but I don't think it would have had quite the same effect as "Christopher" (though again, that's just me, ethnocentrism and all). I'm going to watch the episode in few minutes, I'll pay closer attention and see what you mean.  Cheesedude  ( talk  •  contribs ) 19:52, October 27, 2013 (UTC) 
 Mihael is probably just the Japanese pronounciation of Michael. I don't understand why this debate is still going on. -- Rocket.knight.777  ( talk  •  contribs ) 20:11, October 27, 2013 (UTC) 
 The Japanese pronunciation of "Michael" is more-or-less "Michael." It's written "Maikeru" (マイケル). Don't assume things about language that can be checked in a five second Google search.  Adreus  ( talk  •  contribs ) 20:39, October 27, 2013 (UTC) 
 http://tangorin.com/general/mihaeru  Michael is also a valid choice. That's because the "ch" makes the "h" sound in Germanic languages.  Simple Guillotine  ( talk  •  contribs ) 20:43, October 27, 2013 (UTC) 
 The proof that III's real name is Michael is right here at the 21:14 mark. [1]  -- Rocket.knight.777  ( talk  •  contribs ) 02:49, November 4, 2013 (UTC) 
 God Reference? 
 Because of his red clothes and the fact that he's the youngest, could one say that there is a reference to  Slifer the Sky Dragon  and by extension the  Slifer Red  dorm? -- Rocket.knight.777  ( talk  •  contribs ) 01:18, December 16, 2012 (UTC)
