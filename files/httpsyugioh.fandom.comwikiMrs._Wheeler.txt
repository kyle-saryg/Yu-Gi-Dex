 Mrs. Wheeler  is  Joey  and  Serenity Wheeler 's mother.
 
 History 
 Joey's mother left him when she split up with his father and the two didn't see each other for years until Serenity's operation took place on the morning of the launch of Battle City. Although she has not seen her son for years, there seems to be surprisingly little tension between the two as they are more concerned with making sure that Serenity recovers from the operation. However, she did not appear to stick around for the operation itself, nor was she present when Serenity removed her bandages. In the end of the dub,  Duke Devlin  hints that she and Serenity live together with Joey, or that the siblings live together by themselves.
