 Major Events 
 Arkana  and  Yami Yugi 's " Dark Magician " go against each other. 
 Arkana tells Yugi about how he used to be world-famous stage magician with his fiancée,  Catherine . His face was scarred in a botched trick and in his despair, he made Catherine leave him.
 Later on,  Marik  offered to return Catherine to him if he became a  Rare Hunter . 
 Kaiba  eventually tracks Yugi on his computer.  Téa ,  Solomon Muto , and  Mokuba  attempt to find him. 
 Featured Duel: Yami Yugi vs. Arkana, Part 2 
 Duel continued from previous episode. 
 Yami Yugi  has 4000  LP  remaining and  controls  " Dark Magician " (2500/2100) in Attack Position.
 Arkana  has 1500 LP remaining and controls no cards.
 Turn 4: Arkana 
 Arkana  draws. He then  Normal Summons  " Mystic Tomato " (1400/1100) in  Defense Position  and Sets a card.
 Turn 5: Yami Yugi 
 Yami Yugi  draws. He then  Normal Summons  " Beta The Magnet Warrior " (1700/1600) in  Attack Position . Since Yami Yugi summoned a monster,  Arkana   activates  his face-down " Dark Renewal " to Tribute both "Beta The Magnet Warrior" and "Mystic Tomato" and revive " Dark Magician " (2500/2100) in  Attack Position .  Yami Yugi   Sets  two cards.
 Turn 6: Arkana 
 Arkana  draws. He then  Sets  two cards.
 Turn 7: Yami Yugi 
 Yami Yugi  draws. He then  Sets  one card.
 Turn 8: Arkana 
 Arkana  draws. He then  Sets  one card.
 Turn 9: Yami Yugi 
 Yami Yugi  draws. He then  Sets  one card.
 Turn 10: Arkana 
 Arkana  draws. He then  Sets  one card. Arkana then  activates  his face-down " The Mystical Guillotine " to  destroy   Yami Yugi 's "Dark Magician", but  Yami Yugi   activates  his face-down " Magical Hats " to create four Hats, hide his "Dark Magician in one of them and shuffle the hats up. "The Mystical Guillotine"  destroys  a "Hat", but it turns out to be empty. 
 Arkana   activates  his face-down " Thousand Knives " to automatically  destroy  the hat that contains  Yami Yugi 's "Dark Magician", but  Yami Yugi   activates  his face-down " Cursebreaker " to negate and  destroy  both "Thousand Knives" and "Magical Hats". 
 Arkana 's "Dark Magician"  attacks   Yami Yugi 's "Dark Magician". Both monsters are then destroyed in a  Double KO . Both  Arkana  and Yami Yugi then  activate  their face-down " Monster Reborn " to revive their "Dark Magicians" (2500/2100 for both) in  Attack Position .
 Turn 11: Yami Yugi 
Yami Yugi draws. He then passes his turn.
 Turn 12: Arkana 
 Arkana  draws. He then  Sets  one card.
 Turn 13: Yami Yugi 
 Yami Yugi  draws. He then  Sets  two cards.
 Turn 14: Arkana 
 Arkana   activates  his face-down " Beckon to the Dark " to  send   Yami Yugi 's "Dark Magician" to the Graveyard, but  Yami Yugi   activates  his face-down " Mystical Refpanel " to negate the effect of "Beckon to the Dark" and use the effect of "Beckon to the Dark" on  Arkana 's "Dark Magician" instead. 
 Arkana  then activates his face-down " Nightmare's Chains " to  negate  the effect of "Mystical Refpanel" and  destroy  it. The secondary effect of "Nightmare's Chains" also forbids  Yami Yugi  "Dark Magician" from attacking or changing its battle position. Since Yami Yugi's "Dark Magician" is the only monster he controls, the third effect of "Nightmare's Chains" allows Arkana's monsters to attack directly.  Arkana 's "Dark Magician"  attacks  directly ( Yami Yugi  4000 → 1500).
 Turn 15: Yami Yugi 
 Yami Yugi  draws. He then  Normal Summons  " Big Shield Gardna " (100/2600) in  Defense Position .
 Turn 16: Arkana 
 Arkana  draws. He then  Normal Summons  " Doll of Demise " (1600/1700) in  Attack Position . He then  activates  " Ectoplasmer ", which will let the turn player choose two types of monsters to be converted into ectoplasm, with half of the turn player's Tributed monsters' ATK being inflicted as damage to their opponents during each of their turns. Arkana activates the effect of "Ectoplasmer" and selects "Fiend" for its effect, which causes "Doll of Demise" to be Tributed (Yami Yugi 1500 → 700). 
 Arkana activates the effect of "Ectoplasmer" and selects "Spellcaster" for its effect, which causes his "Dark Magician" to be Tributed, however Yami Yugi's "Dark Magician" is Tributed too and the damage that Yami Yugi would take is nullified.
 Duel concludes next episode. 
 
 Changes to the dub 
 The star of " Dark Renewal " is given five more points in the dub. 
 The blade of " The Mystical Guillotine " has a glow added to it in the dub; ironically, the card's artwork is untouched. 
 When Arkana's Dark Magician is wielding Thousand Knives, the knives are made to glow. 
 A bit showing Pandora/Arkana running from the flames was cut from the dub. 
 In the original, " Nightmare's Chains " chained " Dark Magician " to a cross. In the dub, this cross was changed to a slab. 
 The axe and knives of " Doll of Demise " are obscured in the dub to make it look like its weapons are part of its arms; ironically the card's artwork is also untouched. 
 Although both versions eventually state that both of the Dark Magicians were affected by " Ectoplasmer " because each player controlled one when the magic card was activated, the Japanese version also makes Yami Yugi's card choose to sacrifice itself for him instead of just the Magic Card affecting both.
