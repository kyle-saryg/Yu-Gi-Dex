 This card does not  target . [1] 
 Adding a card from the Deck to your hand and Fusion Summoning 1 monster from your Extra Deck are not considered to happen simultaneously. [1] 
 Adding a card from the Deck to your hand is mandatory, but Fusion Summoning 1 monster from your Extra Deck is optional. [1] 
 When this card resolves, if you cannot add 1 " Gem-Knight " card from the Deck to your hand, then you cannot Fusion Summon 1 " Gem-Knight " monster from your Extra Deck. [1] 
 This card cannot be activated during a turn in which you have already Special Summoned a monster other than a " Gem-Knight " monster. [1] 
 This card can be activated even if the effect of " Vanity's Emptiness " is being applied. In this case, only the " Add  1 " Gem-Knight " card from your  Deck  to your  hand " effect is applied. Also, if " Mystical Space Typhoon " is Chained to " Absorb Fusion ", destroying " Vanity's Emptiness ", then when " Absorb Fusion " resolves, you can Fusion Summon 1 " Gem-Knight " monster from your Extra Deck. [2] 
 " Solemn Warning " can be Chained to " Absorb Fusion ". [3]
