 When  Yuya  arrives in the  Xyz Dimension , he does not find  Shay , but rather  Dennis . In order to ease the sorrow the  Fusion Dimension  has inflicted upon the Xyz Dimension's people, Dennis and Yuya start an  Entertainment   Duel  to bring back their smiles, but...
 
 Featured Duel: Yuya Sakaki vs. Dennis McField 
       Dennis  vs  Yuya .     
 At the start of the  Duel , the  Field Spell Card  " Crossover " is  activated , as per the rules of an  Action Duel . It will allow the players to use  Action Cards , but they may only have one in their  hand  at a time.
 Turn 1: Yuya 
 Yuya  activates " Performapal Gongato " (   2) and " Xiangsheng Magician " (   8) in his  Pendulum Zones . He then  Pendulum Summons  " Odd-Eyes Pendulum Dragon " (2500/2000) in  Attack Position .
 Turn 2: Dennis 
 Dennis   Normal Summons  " Performage Bubble Gardna " (800/2000). Since a " Performage " monster was Normal or  Special Summoned , Dennis Special Summons " Performage Filmsy Slimmer " (100/1200) in Attack Position via its own effect. Dennis activates " Polymerization ",  fusing  "Bubble Gardna" and "Filmsy Slimmer" to  Fusion Summon  " Performage Trapeze Witch " (2400/1800) in Attack position. Dennis  equips  " Ancient Gear Mask " to "Trapeze Witch". "Ancient Gear Mask" prevents the  equipped  monster from being  destroyed by battle  or card effects  once per turn , prevents the opponent from activating  Spell / Trap Cards  if it attacks, allows the equipped monster to inflict  piercing  damage, and allows Dennis to double the  battle damage  if the equipped monster  destroys  a monster by  battle . "Trapeze Witch" attacks "Odd-Eyes". As a "Performage" monster is battling an opponent's monster, Dennis activates its effect, which decreases the ATK of that monster by 600 ("Odd-Eyes": 2500 → 1900 ATK). Yuya finds an Action Card, but the effect of "Ancient Gear Mask" prevents Yuya from activating it until the end of the  Damage Step . The attack continues and "Odd-Eyes" is destroyed. The effect of "Ancient Gear Mask" doubles the battle damage to Yuya (Yuya: 4000 → 3000 LP).
 Turn 3: Yuya 
Yuya Pendulum Summons "Odd-Eyes" (2500/2000) from his  Extra Deck  and " Performapal Miracle Mirrorabbit " (1200/1200) from his hand, both in Attack Position. "Odd-Eyes" attacks "Trapeze Witch", but Dennis activates the effect of "Trapeze Witch" to decrease the ATK of "Odd-Eyes". As a  targeting  effect that would change the ATK of only one monster was activated, Yuya activates the effect of "Mirrorabbit", allowing him to redirect that effect to itself ("Mirrorabbit": 1200 → 600 ATK). The attack continues, but the first effect of "Ancient Gear Mask" prevents the destruction of "FoTrapezerce Witch", once per turn. However, the effect of "Odd-Eyes" doubles the battle damage since "Trapeze Witch" is Level 5 or higher (Dennis: 4000 → 3800 LP). Yuya activates the second effect of "Mirrorabbit", allowing a monster he controls to attack again, at the expense of not attacking itself. He targets "Odd-Eyes". "Odd-Eyes" attacks "Trapeze Witch", but the effect of "Trapeze Witch" acitvates, reducing the ATK of "Odd-Eyes" by 600. Yuya activates the first effect of "Mirrorabbit" to redirect that effect to itself ("Mirrorabbit": 600 → 0 ATK). The attack continues and "Trapeze Witch" is destroyed, doubling the battle damage to Dennis (Dennis: 3800 → 3600 LP).
 Turn 4: Dennis 
Dennis activates " Performage Reversal Dancer " (   2) and " Performage Fire Dancer " (   6) in his Pendulum Zones. He then Pendulum Summons "Bubble Gardna" (800/2000) and "Filmsy Slimmer" (100/1200), both in Attack Position. Dennis  overlays  his two  Level  4  Spellcaster - Type  monsters to Xyz Summon " Performage Trapeze Magician " (2500/2000, ORU: 2) in Attack Position. Dennis activates the effect of "Trapeze Magician", detaching an  Overlay Unit  ("Trapeze Magician": 2 → 1 ORU) to let a monster he controls attack twice per Battle Phase this turn, but if it does not, that monster is destroyed at the end of the Battle Phase. He targets "Trapeze Magician" itself" "Trapeze Magician" attacks "Mirrorabbit", but Yuya activates the Action Card " Evasion ", negating the attack. "Trapeze Magician" attacks "Odd-Eyes", but Yuya finds and activates the Action Card " Miracle ", preventing the destruction of "Odd-Eyes" by battle and halving the battle damage. The attack continues and "Trapeze Magician" is destroyed.
 Dennis activates the  Quick-Play Spell Card  " Rank-Up-Magic Magical Force ", allowing him to Special Summon an  Xyz Monster  that was destroyed by battle this turn from the Graveyard, then Special Summon a Spellcaster-Type monster that is 1  Rank  higher than that monster by using it as the Overlay Unit, then attach itself to the monster Summoned by its effect. Dennis Special Summons "Trapeze Magician" (2500/2000), then performs a  Rank-Up Xyz Evolution  to Xyz Summon " Performage Trapeze High Magician " (2700/2200, ORU: 2) in Attack Position. Dennis activates the effect of "Trapeze High Magician", detaching an Overlay Unit ("Trapeze High Magician": 2 → 1 ORU) to let it attack three times this turn, though only one of these attacks may be a  direct attack . Yuya attempts to grab an Action Card, but he fails to reach it. "Trapeze High Magician" attacks and destroys "Odd-Eyes" (Yuya: 3000 → 2800 LP). Yuya again attempts to grab an Action Card, but he fails to reach it. "Trapeze High Magician" attacks and destroys "Mirrorabbit" (Yuya: 2800 → 100 LP). "Trapeze High Magician" attacks directly, but Yuya activates the Pendulum Effect of "Gongato" as he controls no monsters, reducing the battle damage to 0.
 Turn 5: Yuya 
Yuya Pendulum Summons "Odd-Eyes" (2500/2000) and "Mirrorabbit" (1200/12000) from his Extra Deck, both in Attack Position. Yuya then Normal Summons " Performapal Sword Fish " (600/600). Yuya activates the effect of "Sword Fish", allowing him to reduce the ATK of a monster on the field by 600 until the  End Phase . He targets "Trapeze High Magician" ("Trapeze High Magician": 2700 → 2100 ATK). Dennis activates the effect of "Trapeze High Magician", detaching an Overlay Unit ("Trapeze High Magician": 1 → 0 ORU) to prevent its destruction by battle or card effect up to thrice per turn.
 Yuya activates the  Continuous Spell Card  " Challenge Stairs ". While active, if a monster Yuya controls fails to destroy an opponent's monster by battle, Yuya can  send  a card he controls to the Graveyard to let that monster attack again. Yuya then activates the Continuous Spell " Hope Stairs ", which increases the ATK of a monster he controls that attacked by 400 until the next  Standby Phase . "Odd-Eyes" attacks "Trapeze High Magician", but the effect "Trapeze High Magician" prevents it from being destroyed (Dennis: 3600 → 3200 LP). The effect of "Hope Stairs" activates, increasing th ATK of "Odd-Eyes" by 400 until the next Standby Phase ("Odd-Eyes": 2500 → 2900 ATK). As a monster on the field gained ATK, Dennis activates the  Pendulum Effect  of "Reversal Dancer", allowing him to increase the ATK of a "Performage" monster by the same amount. He targets "Trapeze High Magician" ("Trapeze High Magician": 2100 → 2500 ATK).
 Yuya activates the effect of "Mirrorabbit", allowing "Odd-Eyes" to attack once again, at the expense of not attacking itself. "Odd-Eyes" attacks "Trapeze High Magician", but it is not destroyed (Dennis: 3200 → 2800 LP). Yuya activates the effect of "Hope Stairs", increasing the ATK of "Odd-Eyes" by 400 ("Odd-Eyes": 2900 → 3300 ATK). Yuya activate the effect of "Challenge Stairs", sending "Xiangsheng Magician" to the Graveyard to let "Odd-Eyes" attack again. "Trapeze High Magician" is not destroyed (Dennis: 2800 → 2000 LP). Yuya activates the effect of "Hope Stairs" to increase the ATK of "Odd-Eyes" by 400 ("Odd-Eyes": 3300 → 3700 ATK).
 Yuya activates the effect of "Challenge Stairs", sending " Performapal Gongato " to let "Odd-Eyes" attack again. "Odd-Eyes" attacks "Trapeze High Magician", and Yuya activates the Action Card " Miracle ", preventing the destruction of "Trapeze High Magician" and halving the battle damage (Dennis: 2000 → 1400 LP). Yuya activates the effect of "Hope Stairs", increasing the ATK of "Odd-Eyes" by 400 ("Odd-Eyes": 3700 → 4100 ATK). Yuya activates the effect of "Challenge Stairs", sending "Sword Fish" to the Graveyard to allow "Odd-Eyes" to attack once again.
