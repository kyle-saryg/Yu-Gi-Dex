 "Let the Tournament Begin!!" , known as  "Start of the Tournament Finals"  in the Japanese version, is the twentieth chapter of the  Yu-Gi-Oh! GX  manga . It was first printed in Japanese in  V Jump  magazine and in English in  Shonen Jump  magazine. Both of which were printed in  volume 2  of the  Yu-Gi-Oh! GX  graphic novels afterwards.
 
 Summary 
 Chancellor Sheppard  meets with  Dr. Crowler  and  Professor Hibiki  in his office. The two hand him the results of the preliminaries. Five of the eight finalists are first-year students, and two of them are from  Slifer Red . Both American students also made the final eight, as well as a single third-year student. The match-ups have been randomly selected, and they will be  Jaden Yuki  vs.  Seika Kohinata ,  Alexis Rhodes  vs.  David Rabb ,  Chazz Princeton  vs.  Syrus Truesdale  and  Bastion Misawa  vs.  Reggie MacKenzie . Jaden approaches David, telling him he made it the finals just as David told him after he declined Jaden's duel invitation earlier. David expects to duel Reggie in the finals, as they are in separate blocks. Alexis warns David not to underestimate her, while David is shocked that Syrus also made it to the finals.
 Zane Truesdale  meets with Seika, and is surprised to see her taking dueling seriously. She states she had a change of heart, and wishes to earn title of Miss Duel Academy back through dueling. A short time later, the first duel begins, with Jaden facing Seika. She thinks it's convenient for her to face Jaden in the first round, as it was his duel with Alexis that caused her enter this tournament in the first place to assuage her pride. Jaden goes first, and  Summons  " Elemental Hero Stratos " in  Attack Position  and  Sets  a card. Seika Summons " Black Mamba ", whose  effect   activates , shifting "Stratos" to  Defense Position . This allows "Black Mamba" to attack and  destroy  it. Seika Sets a card, and Jaden begins his turn. He Summons " Elemental Hero Voltic " and  equips  him with " Voltic Spear ", increasing his attack by 1000 points. Jaden attacks, but Seika activates her  face-down  " Viper's Grudge ", letting her  Special Summon  a  Level  4 or lower  Reptile - type  monster from her  Deck  each time one of her Reptile-types is sent to the  Graveyard . "Black Mamba" is destroyed, so she Summons a second copy from her Deck, whose effect switches "Voltic" to Defense Position.
 Seika  Tributes  "Black Mamba" to Summon " Urubonus, the Avatar of Malice " in Attack Position. "Viper's Grudge" activates, letting her Special Summon another "Black Mamba" from her Deck, whose effect switches "Voltic" to Attack Position. Seika attacks, with "Urubonus'" effect decreasing "Voltic's" attack points by 300, which lets her destroy it. She attacks  directly  with "Black Mamba" before activating " Swamp of the Dragon Snake ", which will Special Summon a Reptile-type monster from her Deck to Jaden's side of the  field  during each of her  End Phases . She Summons " Poisonous Viper " to Jaden's field. Jaden  draws , and "Poisonous Viper's" effect activates, dealing 500 damage to its controller during the  Standby Phase . Jaden Summons " Rai-Oh " in Attack Position and attacks "Black Mamba". "Rai-Oh's" effect prevents both players from taking cards from their Decks in any way besides drawing. Thus, "Viper's Grudge" cannot activate. Seika comments that it's a troublesome card, but it won't matter, as she has enough in her hand to defeat Jaden.

He then activates " Voltic Spear " and  Equips  it to Voltic", increasing its  ATK  by 1000 ("Elemental Hero Voltic": 1000 → 2000/1600). "Voltic" attacks and destroys "Black Mamba" (Seika: 4000 → 3300). Seika  activates  her  face-down  " Viper's Grudge ", which lets her  Special Summon  a  Level  4 or lower  Snake  monster from her  Deck  each time one of her  Reptile - Type  monsters is sent from the  field  to the  Graveyard . Thus, she Special Summons another "Black Mamba" (1300/1000) in Attack Position, and then activates it effect to switch "Voltic" to Defense Position.
 Turn 4: Seika 
Seika draws " Urubonus, the Avatar of Malice ". Seika  Tributes  "Black Mamba" to  Tribute Summon  "Urubonus" (2000/800) in Attack Position. Since a  Reptile - Type  monster was sent to the  Graveyard , "Viper's Grudge" activates, letting Seika Special Summon another "Black Mamba" (1300/1000) in Attack Position. The effect of "Black Mamba" switches "Voltic" to Attack Position. Seika attacks "Voltic" with "Urubonus", whose effect activates, decreasing the ATK of "Voltic" by 300, ("Elemental Hero Voltic": 2000 → 1700/1600). "Urubonus destroys "Voltic" (Jaden: 4000 → 3700). "Black Mamba" attacks Jaden  directly  (Jaden: 3700 → 2400). Seika then activates " Swamp of the Dragon Snake " from her hand, allowing her to Special Summon a Level 4 or lower Reptile-Type monster to Jaden's side of the field during each of her  End Phases . She Special Summons " Poisonous Viper " (100/200) to Jaden's side of the field in Attack Position.
 Turn 5: Jaden 
Jaden draws " Rai-Oh ". During Jaden's  Standby Phase , the effect of "Poisonous Viper" activates, decreasing Jaden's Life Points by 500 (Jaden: 2400 → 1900). Jaden then Normal Summons "Thunder King Rai-Oh" (1900/800) in Attack Position. "Thunder King Rai-Oh" attacks and destroys "Black Mamba" (Seika: 3300 → 2700). Jaden then activates the special effect of "Rai-Oh", which prevents either player from drawing a card from their  deck  other than in a  Normal Draw . This effect negates the activation of "Viper's Grudge", preventing Seika from summoning a new Reptile monster from her deck. Jaden Sets a card.
 Duel continues in  the next chapter .
