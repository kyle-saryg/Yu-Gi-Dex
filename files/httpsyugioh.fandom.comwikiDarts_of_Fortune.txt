      Jonouchi  playing Darts of Fortune.     
 Darts of Fortune  is the first stage in  The Get the Million Game . It has a prize of ¥100,000. [1] 
 The two bunnies on the show spin a wheel, which is divided into two sections. The larger section is labeled "¥100,000". The smaller section is labelled "lose". The player is to throw a dart at the wheel while it spins. If the dart lands on the larger section, the player wins ¥100,000 and advances to the next stage. [1] 
 When  Jonouchi  was on The Get the Million Game, his dart landed just outside the "lose" section. [1]
