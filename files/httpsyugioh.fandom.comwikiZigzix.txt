 Appearance 
 Zigzix has a large shock of brown hair that he wears in a style resembling the blade of an axe. He has long bangs and wears amber-tinted glasses.
 
 Personality 
 Zigzix gets overenthusiastic when describing things as he tends to do wild gesticulations while doing so (in the Japanese version Rex tolerates his antics, whereas in the dub, Rex is less patient with him). [1]  However, he can briefly act serious, such as when the power went out [2]  or when he warned the gang that the  Divine Temple  was going to fall on  New Domino City . [3] 
 
 Biography 
 Zigzix is an underling of  Rex Goodwin 's who heads up  R.R.D. , the Reactor Research Division for  KaibaCorp . He is responsible for ensuring that all of  Domino City  gets the energy it needs to function. Zigzix was in the process of proposing a new " Ener-D  machine" to Goodwin when his demonstration was interrupted by Goodwin's secretary,  Mina Simington . [1] 
 During the Duel between  Yusei  and  Jack , Zigzix called Goodwin to inform him that the Ener-D Machine was malfunctioning. This appeared to be because of the appearance of the  mysterious Red Dragon  at the stadium. The Red Dragon's power causes the Ener-D machine to shut down, shutting down all the power within two blocks of the city. Zigzix manages to restore power within seconds. [2] 
 Zigzix, Lazar and Rex Goodwin later talk about the footage involving the Crimson Dragon in Yusei and Jack's previous Duel. Zigzix was eventually ordered to enlarge a card image by Jack. [4] 
 During the  Fortune Cup , Zigzix and Rex conspire to root out  Signers  in the tournament. Zigzix bugs the stadium with a  D-Sensor  that, when Duel energy is released, causes extreme pain to Signers. He is initially dissatisfied with the results, as what he takes to be  Luna  is not producing any reaction. However, her non-Signer brother,  Leo , is Dueling in her place. Later, Zigzix spots the actual Luna in the audience, and reports his findings back to Goodwin. [5] 
 Zigzix meets with more success later on in the tournament. When Luna and  Akiza 's birthmarks glow, Zigzix gets the reading on his D-Sensor. Each time he gets a reading, he informs Goodwin. [6] [7] 
 When the  Crimson Dragon  finally appears during Yusei's Duel with Jack at the finale of the  Fortune Cup , Goodwin orders Zigzix to turn his machine off, with the risk of a similar incident to the one that occurred at  Greiger 's hometown occurring again. [8] 
 He later explains to  Team 5D's  and  Lazar  why the Ener-D in New Domino City has stopped working, and that the  Ark Cradle  is about to crash onto it in twelve hours. [3]
