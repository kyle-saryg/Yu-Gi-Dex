 " Noble Knight ", referred to as " Sacred Knight " in the anime and some video games, and known as " Holy Knight " ( 聖 騎 士   Seikishi ) in the  OCG , is an  archetype  of  LIGHT ,  DARK , and  FIRE   Warrior   monsters . It was introduced in the  Yu-Gi-Oh! 5D's Tag Force 5 Strategy Guide  and received its first support in  Return of the Duelist  with " Noble Arms - Gallatin ". This archetype is also used by Sherry Leblanc in " Yu-Gi-Oh! 5Ds ", by  Kento Naito  in the spin-off manga series  Yu-Gi-Oh! D Team ZEXAL  and by  Lightning  in  Yu-Gi-Oh! Legacy of the Duelist: Link Evolution .
 All printed "Noble Knights" (except those used by Sherry) are based on either the  Knights of the Round Table  of Arthurian legend, the  Twelve Peers of Charlemagne  from Carolingian legend, or on related concepts from either. The " Noble Arms " archetype supports this archetype, and encompasses weapons used by those knights.

 Naming in the  TCG 
 In Italian, Portuguese and Spanish, the archetype names are respectively "Nobile Cavaliere", "Nobre Cavaleiro" and "Noble Caballero", with the adjective meaning "Noble" coming before the noun meaning "Knight". This is to make sure that the  support cards  work well with "Ignoble Knight" cards which are called "Ignobile Cavaliere", "Inobre Cavaleiro" and "Innoble Caballero"; however, in these languages the " Noble Arms " archetype has the adjective after the noun meaning "Arms". In French, the adjective is placed after the noun in both cases of "Noble Knight" ("Chevalier Noble") and "Noble Arms" ("Armes Nobles"), as "Ignoble Knight" cards are simply named "Chevalier Noble Infâme" (literally "Infamous Noble Knight"). 
 There is no  agreement  on the noun phrase "Noble Knight" in English (the plural form is simply "Noble Knights", with no change reflected on the adjective "Noble"). However, in other languages there is, which makes the naming of the archetype potentially complicated.
 Plural forms are never used in French, German and Spanish card names, as shown on " Artorigus, King of the Noble Knights ", " Noble Knight Brothers ", " Last Chapter of the Noble Knights " and " Noble Knights of the Round Table ". 
 An ungrammatical plural form is used in Portuguese ("Nobre Cavaleiros"), without making the adjective "Nobre" agree, as shown on "Last Chapter of the Noble Knights" and "Noble Knights of the Round Table". 
 In Italian, agreement is still applied on "Noble Knight Brothers", "Last Chapter of the Noble Knights" and "Noble Knights of the Round Table", with the plural form being "Nobili Cavalieri". This makes support confusing for a few "Noble Knight" support cards, such as "Noble Knight Brothers", " Ignoble Knight of High Laundsallyn " and "Artorigus, King of the Noble Knights". However, cards whose names contain feminine and plural variants of archetype names seem to be implicitly considered for membership as with other archetypes. 
 " Noble Knight Joan ", despite being female, is referred to as a male in all non-English  TCG . Feminine equivalents (e.g. French  chevaleresse , Spanish  caballera , German  Ritterin ) of the words for "knight" do occur to some degree, however in this case, they aren't used, to reduce ambiguity and prevent grammatical gender from interfering with the game play.

 Playing style 
 The archetype relies on equipping the "Noble Knights" with the "Noble Arms" Spell Cards and take advantage of this, either by  searching  for more support or simply  destroying  cards. There are also some "Noble Knights" that behave like  Gemini monsters , being treated as Normal monsters while they are not equipped with a "Noble Arms" card. Once equipped, they gain an effect, and with the exception of "Gwalchavad", all of them become DARK and increase their Level by 1, in order to assist the Xyz Summon of " Sacred Noble Knight of King Artorigus " or the effect of " Lady of the Lake " to Synchro Summon " Ignoble Knight of High Laundsallyn ". The "pure" Level 5 "Noble Knights" can be Special Summoned from the hand and/or Graveyard and also serve to speed up the aforementioned Xyz/Synchro Summons.
 The aforementioned "Noble Arms" are Equip Spell Cards in the shape of swords with a broad variety of effects, that range from offensive effects like  destroying  cards or giving  ATK boost  to support/defensive effects like  protecting  against destruction and  targeting  effects. With the exception of "Excaliburn", all of them can re-equip to a "Noble Knight" you control when they are destroyed and sent to the Graveyard, so that even if you Special Summon a Extra Deck "Noble Knight", by using materials that were equipped with "Noble Arms", those Spell Cards will re-equip themselves to that new monster.

 Weaknesses 
 Efficient cogency of this archetype is the aforementioned almost complete-dependence of both "Noble Knights" being equipped with "Noble Arms" (plus the effect of "Gwenhwyfar") combined with GY presence (e.g. for the effects of  Noble Knights of the Round Table  and "Avalon").  Therefore, beating "Noble Knight" Decks are threefold: denying the "Noble Arms"' field presence, occluding the sending of "Noble" cards to the GY and "Noble Knight" monster removal:
 
 For "Noble Arms" field presence control and GY-blockading, Spell/Trap removal  combined  with  banishing  is a way to go.  Banish-enablers like " Masked HERO Dark Law  and " Macro Cosmos " combined with cards like " Linkslayer ", " Cyber Prima ", " Chiron the Mage ", " De-Spell " " Twin Twisters " and " Sky Striker Maneuver - Afterburners! " or even cards like " Disarmament ", " Eternal Rest " and " Really Eternal Rest " (as "Noble Arms" Spells are Equip Spells) will do the trick.  " Cosmic Cyclone " despite costing  1 / 8 th  of one's starting  LPs , is a one-card army that can do the job more directly.  " Evenly Matched " arguably does this job best however, banishing not only "Noble Arms Spells and the monsters equipped to them but also making it harder to return their banished  and   Face-down  state back to the GY or  Deck .  If banishing can't be accomplished yet, an interesting counter would be to flip a "Noble Knight" face-down during an attempted equipping.  As long as there isn't another "Noble Knight" on the field, cards like " Prediction Princess Tarotrei ", " Invoked Raidjin ", " Castel, the Skyblaster Musketeer " and " Book of Moon " can leave an activated "Noble Arms" without a target and ensure its effects isn't immediately transferred to another "Noble Knight".
 The "Noble Arms" can also be stopped from being used in the first place.  Cards like " Ash Blossom & Joyous Spring ", " Thunder Dragon Colossus ", and " Mistaken Arrest " can prevent "Noble" cards from being added to the hand.  " Ghost Belle & Haunted Mansion " and " Big Burn " can stop "Avalon", "Gwalchavad" from recovering "Noble Knights" from the GY or "Lady of the Lake"'s Special Summoning effect.  If they  do  in fact get tutored however, the knowledge of added "Noble Knight"s or "Noble Arms" to the hand can be used to an advantage through " Mind Crush " or " D.D. Designator "; you can even establish a gung-ho approach to this method by forcing a search through " Dark Designator ". 
 Finally, without "Noble Arms", "Noble Knights" are almost without teeth and thus, can be easily dealt with.  On the field, in addition to beatdown strategies and oppressive boss monsters (like " Ultimate Conductor Tyranno "), "Noble Knights" can be easily Tributed (" The Winged Dragon of Ra - Sphere Mode " and " Lava Golem " may both be the best at doing this because multiple Tributings can lessen the chances of "Noble Arms" (if any on the field) being equipped to other monsters if banishing isn't an option yet.), be shuffled into the Deck, be sent to the GY non-destructively, be banished taken control of for a myriad of uses and used as material for Summons by your opponent.  " Ghost Reaper & Winter Cherries " can also hit Extra Deck "Noble Knight"s, guaranteering they never make the field.
