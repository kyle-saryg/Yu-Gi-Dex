 Biography 
 During the commercial break, when  Katsuya Jonouchi  took part in The Get the Million Game, the producer met up with the technician to check that  The Wheel of Fate  game had been rigged to lose. The two laughed at how Jonouchi's failure would boost their ratings. However  Yugi Mutou  overheard their conversation. Enraged over how they were taking advantage of Jonouchi's desperate hopes, he transformed into  Dark Yugi . [1] 
 The technician had a switchboard containing a button, which would prevent the wheel in The Wheel of Fate game from stopping on the winning section. He had it painted red, so he wouldn't get confused with the other buttons. [1] 
 Dark Yugi met the technician and the producer just before they pushed the button. He forced them into playing a game, threatening to tell people how the game was rigged if they didn't take part. The producer ordered the technician to tie his arm to a rope which had a 50-50 chance of being tied to a paint can, as Yugi had demanded. Yugi tied his hand to another rope. On Yugi's signal, both of them tugged at their ropes. The technician got the one tied to the paint can and pulled it on top of his head. With him out of action, the producer tried to push the button instead, but since the can of paint had spilled on the switchboard, painting all the buttons red, the producer was unable to push the right button in the tech's stead. [1]
