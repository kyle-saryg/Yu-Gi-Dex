 This pulse of yours beats so violently as the engine goes full throttle<br\>You head on forward aiming for your goal, just as you believe in your friends<br\>You've fallen down once too many times, but you’ll try again<br\>The time has now come to pull yourself together

 Be one with the wind, raise up a storm<br\>and bring it alongside you<br\>So now head on without even turning your back<br\>Cause now is the time<br\>to go and save them, all of those innocent lives<br\>Raise your resolves and tear right through your enemies<br\>Going my way!! Head to the vortex of struggle! 
 
 
 Kaze ni nori maiagare<br\>Yūki torimodose<br\>Ano hi mita yume kasaneawa se yukou<br\>Ubaitore sono ude de<br\>Nani mo osorezu ni<br\>Mirai e tsuzuku kono michi o<br\>Going my way!! Kirihiraite yuke! 
 
 Be one with the wind, soar off right now<br\>and go regain your courage<br\>Let us overlay our dreams from that day long gone<br\>Now take what you have, place them in your arms<br\>There's nothing to be afraid of<br\>On this path towards the future<br\>Going My Way!! Cut open a path and go!
