 Biography 
 Shadi went to  Domino Museum  to pass judgment on the organizers of an archaeological dig on an Egyptian tomb, which he regarded as defilement on the territory of the gods. He first played a  Shadow Game  with  Curator Kanekura , in which he performed the  Weighing of the Heart , using the  Millennium Scales . He placed the  Feather of Ma'at  in one side of the scales and as he asked Kanekura a series of questions, his sins would add weight to the other side. He asked a series of questions to test Kanekura's morality. As he lied the sins side of the scales gained weight. Before the last question, Shadi used an illusion to transform Kanekura's chair into  Ammit . The final question was if Kanekura had defiled the territory of the Gods for money. He begged Shadi to stop, offering to pay any amount of money. However this caused the sins side of the scales to hit the table. Shadi then inflicted a  Penalty Game , where Kanekura was rendered unconscious by the illusion of Ammit. [1]
