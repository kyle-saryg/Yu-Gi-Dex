 Yu-Gi-Oh! Duel Monsters  features 365 cards, with the last 15 cards being secret. Most of the cards present were invented for the game; cards featured from the manga are from  Yu-Gi-Oh! Duelist - Duel 032  and prior. The basic rules are based on the mechanics of the manga, not to be confused with the more complex  OCG  format invented later.
 
 There are 315  Normal Monsters  (from number 001 to 300, and from 351 to 365) and 50  Spell Cards  (from number 301 to 350) in the game; these are the only types of cards featured. 
 While there are no  Fusion Monsters  (and thus no  Fusion Deck ), fusions can be performed by trying to  summon  a monster from the  hand  on top of a monster on the  field  (e.g. " Ansatsu " + " Darkfire Dragon " = " Flame Swordsman "). 
         " B.eye White Dragon "      Monsters only have an  ATK ,  DEF ,  Type , and description.  Levels ,  Attributes , and  Alignments  are not featured in  Yu-Gi-Oh! Duel Monsters , and monsters can be summoned without  tributing . 
 There is no  Deck Cost  and no limit to the  number of copies of one card  which can be in a  Deck , but the Deck must contain exactly 40 cards and the player can only have one Deck at a time. There is no  Side Deck . 
 Each Duelist's  hand  consists of five cards. 
 Each  turn  has the same layout:
 The  turn player   draws a card . 
 The turn player must  play one card from their hand . If their hand is empty, the Duel ends and the Duelist with higher  Life Points  wins. Only one card can be played from the hand each turn. 
 The turn player must  attack with or switch to   Defense Position  each monster on their side of the field. 
 The turn  ends . 
 The player always goes first in a Duel, but does not  draw a card  and cannot  attack  on the first turn. 
         Battle screen showing " Sangan " attacking " Ancient Jar ".      Attacking  works the same  as it does in the  OCG  and  TCG .
 If the  attack target  is in  Attack Position :
 If the monsters have different ATK, the monster with the lowest ATK is destroyed and its controller takes battle damage equal to the difference. 
 If the monsters have equal ATK, both monsters are destroyed and neither Duelist takes battle damage. 
 If the attack target is in Defense Position:
 If the attack target's DEF is greater than the attacker's ATK, neither monster is destroyed and the attacking monster's controller takes battle damage equal to the difference. 
 If the attack target's DEF is lower than the attacker's ATK, the attack target is destroyed and its controller does not take battle damage. 
 If the attack target's DEF equals the attacker's ATK, neither monster is destroyed and neither Duelist takes battle damage. 
 If the opponent has no monsters, the turn player can  attack the opponent directly . In this case, the opponent takes battle damage equal to the attacking monster's ATK. 
 The player receives a card after every win or draw. Milestone drops are also awarded after every 10 wins against each opponent, up to 100 wins per opponent. 
 Promotional cards 
 Main article:  Yu-Gi-Oh! Duel Monsters  promotional cards 
 Each copy of  Yu-Gi-Oh! Duel Monsters  came with three cards randomly selected from the following set of ten cards: [1]

 " Castle of Dark Illusions " 
 " Dark Magician " 
 " Hitotsu-Me Giant " 
 " Mirror Force " 
 " Monster Reborn " 
 " Red-Eyes B. Dragon " 
 " Ryu-Kishin " 
 " Summoned Skull " 
 " Swords of Revealing Light " 
 The cards in this promotional set were from  Konami's  Yu-Gi-Oh! Duel Monsters , a set of 21 cards that also included the  Yu-Gi-Oh! Monster Capsule: Breed and Battle  promotional cards  and the  Yu-Gi-Oh! Duel Monsters  meeting experience card . All of these cards were printed as  Holofoil Rares  and are  Illegal  because they predate the  OCG  and use a completely different  card design .
