 Summary 
 Yusei  and  Jack  have just  Synchro Summoned  " Stardust Dragon " and " Red Dragon Archfiend " and had them removed from play for three turns by Yusei's " Star Excursion ". Yusei explains that they have gone to their futures and he expects to find his own future in this Duel. Jack  Sets  a card in his  Spell & Trap Card Zone  and ends his turn.
 
       Yusei 's plan.     
 Yusei begins his turn. He draws " Quickdraw Synchron " and both players'  SPC  goes up to 2. He looks at other cards in his  hand ; " Triangle Warrior ", " Speed Spell - Defense Buster " and " Turbo Synchron " and comes up with a plan. He sends "Turbo Synchron" to the  Graveyard  to Special Summon "Quickdraw Synchron". By Special Summoning two " Triangle Tokens " to Jack's side of the  field , Yusei Special Summons "Triangle Warrior" from his hand. He then tunes the  Level  2 "Triangle Warrior" to the Level 5 "Quickdraw Synchron" and  chants   "Clustering minds will now become a new force. Become the path its light shines upon. Synchro Summon! Blaze on, Nitro Warrior!"  as he Synchro Summons the  Level  7 " Nitro Warrior ". He then activates "Speed Spell - Defense Buster" to switch one of the "Triangle Tokens" to  Attack Mode .
 Jack now sees why Yusei Summoned the  Tokens  to his side of the field. Since he used a  Spell Card , Yusei explains that "Nitro Warrior" gains 1000  ATK  during  damage calculation  for one  attack . The rest of  team 5D's  are watching the Duel and  Leo  is surprised to see the ATK of "Nitro Warrior" go up to 3800.  Akiza  explains that that's not all; when "Nitro Warrior" destroys a  monster  by battle, it can switch another opponent's monster to Attack Mode and attack it too and if that works he'll perform a  One Turn Kill  by inflicting 4200  damage .  Luna  guesses Yusei is trying to beat Jack down with all his strength.  Crow  recalls Yusei saying that he was using this Duel to determine his future and assumes that Yusei wasn't just talking about himself and thinks Yusei is trying to send a message out to all of them. Each of them is to find their future, Akiza wonders and its starts to rain.
 
       " Influence Dragon " intercepts.     
 At the Duel, Yusei gets "Nitro Warrior" to attack one of the "Triangle Tokens" with " Dynamite Knuckle ". However Jack activates his  Trap Card , " Break Tune ". When his opponent declares an attack, he can Special Summon a  Tuner monster  from his hand and  negate  the attack, so he Summons " Influence Dragon ". "Nitro Warrior" stops its attack and its ATK returns to 2800.
 Jack rides up next to Yusei and tells him not to lose his head; The clash between them is meant to completely eliminate one of them and the last light goes to the one who the light shines upon as the curtain falls. Only one of them shall shine in this Duel, Jack says and that will be himself. Yusei ends his turn.
 Akiza thinks its amazing that Jack's not budging an inch. Crow says that Jack has already found his future, he has no hesitation and is full of nothing but strength. He admits to feeling envious of Jack right now, as does Akiza.
 
       " Power Supplier " increases the  ATK  of " Exploder Dragonwing ".     
 Jack begins his turn and both players SPC goes up to 3. When "Influence Dragon" is being used as  Synchro Material , it can turn the remaining Synchro Material into  Dragon - Type  monsters. He says that the annoying Tokens Yusei gave him shall be the course riding him to victory. He tunes the two Level 2 "Triangle Tokens" to his Level 3 "Influence Dragon" and chants  "The ruler's shouts echo throughout. Hammer of victory shatter the very Earth. Synchro Summon! Flap your wings, Explode Wing Dragon!" , as he Synchro Summons the Level 7 " Exploder Dragonwing ". Yusei points out that "Nitro Warrior" has more ATK, but Jack proceeds to Summon " Power Supplier " in  Defense Mode . Its effect increases the ATK of "Exploder Dragonwing" by 400, making it 2800, which is equal to that of "Nitro Warrior".
 "Exploder Dragonwing" attacks "Nitro Warrior" with its "King Storm" attack. Despite having the same ATK, "Nitro Warrior" is destroyed and Yusei's  Life Points  drop to 1200 and Jack overtakes Yusei. Jack explains that the effect of "Exploder Dragonwing" automatically destroys a monster with equal ATK that its battles and inflicts damage to his opponent equal to the destroyed monster's ATK.
 Jack asks if Yusei has come to understand that with his absolute unmatchable power and Yusei having no cards in his hand, there is nothing Yusei can do against him.  Crow is amazed by Jack's move and Akiza starts to worry for Yusei. Jack  Sets  a card in his Spell & Trap Card Zone and ends his turn.
 As they ride on, Jack says that this is the roar of his thunderous lance. If Yusei is a sword, Jack is an axe, Jack explains because he will wildly slash at anything before him until nothing remains and all souls foolish to rebel against a giant will be stomped flat.
 
         Yusei takes a different path to  Jack .     
 To Jack's surprise, Yusei moves into a different road along the highway. He apologizes and says that he has taken a different path than Jack and his path ties along with the wind and he won't be caught by a brutish simpleton. Jack smirks and comments that Yusei is rather boastful today. Yusei replies that he is just keeping up with Jack and won't let him win this Duel easily. Jack says that that is very well and he shall just rip victory from Yusei's hands.
 Akiza says that Yusei is enjoying this Duel and having fun from the bottom of his heart. Crow agrees and adds that Yusei is overjoyed that Jack is giving his all in this Duel.
 Yusei begins his turn and the two players' SPC goes up to 4. He draws " Sneak Giant ". Since Jack  controls  monsters while he controls none, Yusei is able to use the effect of "Sneak Giant". It Special Summons a Level 1 monster from his Graveyard and can then be  Normal Summoned  itself without  Release . Yusei revives "Turbo Synchron" and Normal Summons "Sneak Giant". He then tunes the Level 5 "Sneak Giant" to the Level 1 "Turbo Synchron" and chants  "Clustering bonds weave a greater force. Become the path its light shines upon. Synchro Summon! Show yourself, Turbo Warrior!" , a he Synchro Summons the Level 6 " Turbo Warrior ".
 
         " Turbo Warrior " halves the ATK of "Exploder Dragonwing".     
 Yusei attacks "Exploder Dragonwing" with "Turbo Warrior". Since "Exploder Dragonwing" is a Level 6 or higher Synchro Monster, the effect of "Turbo Warrior" halves its ATK, reducing it to 1400. "Turbo Warrior" uses its "Accel Slash" attack and destroys "Exploder Dragonwing", dropping Jack's Life Points to 2900. Jack tells Yusei that that move wasn't bad. Yusei replies that its like he said, he's just keeping up with him.
 
         Akiza  thinks about Yusei and what she should do.     
 Crow is excited to see Yusei make a counter and the twins start cheering for both Yusei and Jack. Akiza thinks that Yusei has always fought for another's sake, like  when he fought for her  back at the  hospital . He protected her and through dueling, opened her eyes, she thinks and now the same Yusei who has always fought for someone else is now fighting for himself, so he can find his future. This makes her happy and she has an epiphany to find her own future, which she will protect by herself without help from anyone.
 Yusei ends his turn and Jack begins his. Their SPC goes up to 5 and Jack draws " Vice Dragon ". Since Yusei controls a Synchro Monster, while he controls none, Jack is able to Special Summon the Tuner monster, " Mirror Resonator " through its effect. Its effect makes its Level equal to a Synchro Monster his opponent controls, making it 6. He tunes the Level 2 "Power Supplier" to the Level 6 "Mirror Resonator" and chants  "The kings determination is conceived with a crimson blade ablaze fires of red. Appear from beyond the burning hot waves. Synchro Summon! The burning kishin, Crimson Blader!" , as he Synchro Summons the Level 8 " Crimson Blader ".
 
         " Crimson Blader " is Summoned.     
 "Crimson Blader" attacks and destroys "Turbo Warrior" with its "Red Burner" attack. Since "Crimson Blader" destroyed a monster by battle, Yusei cannot Summon during his next turn. Yusei asks if this is the result of Jack's special training. A power Duel requires one to get a bit rough, Jack remarks and his dueling gives birth to new power and he's now closer than he's ever been to its completion.
 As Leo watches the Duel, he thinks that Jack and Yusei have always been there for him. He reflects on his Duel against Yusei and his Duel against  Aporia  where he fought alongside Jack. They both taught him how to never give up until the end and gave him the power to protect Luna, as her brother.
 Similarly, Luna thinks about how Yusei and everyone else was there for her. She reflects on Yusei supporting her during her Duel against  Devack . It was thanks to her friends that she got the courage and strength to not run away from her duties.
 Yusei begins his turn and the two players' SPC goes up to 6. He draws and activates " Speed Spell - Angel Baton ". It causes him to draw two cards and discard one. Jack comments that for someone with no cards in their hand, that's quite a nice card to have drawn, but the next draw determines his fate. Yusei draws " Scramble Egg " and " Fake Gardna ". Since he can't Summon a monster due to the effect of "Crimson Blader", he considers discarding "Fake Gardna". As he thinks about what to do, he and Jack enter  Central Domino Tunnel . Yusei discards "Fake Gardna" and  Sets  "Scramble Egg" before ending his turn.
 
         Jack predicts Yusei's move.     
 Yusei finally drew a monster, but had no choice to send it to the Graveyard being unable to Summon it, Jack asks. Yusei replies "I guess" and asks if Jack is trying to think what he's thinking. Jack claims to have already seen through Yusei's trick; If he attacks  directly , Yusei can Special Summon the "Fake Gardna" from his Graveyard and use it as a shield to block the attack from "Crimson Blader". It's a plan Yusei would come up with, Jack says and Yusei asks if they ever change. Yusei says that he and Jack live on forever dueling this way, clashing their cards and pride against one another and relaying their feelings in the process. Jack agrees that that will never change; not now, in the past or in the future.
 
         Crow , Yusei and Jack dueling as children.     
 Crow thinks that that is true and reflects on growing up, including when he dueled with Yusei and Jack at  Martha's house , when he gave cards to the children,  Daichi ,  Taiga ,  Ginga ,  Hikari  and  Kokoro  and when the children them made a poster of him for the  World Racing Grand Prix . Neither he, nor his dueling will change, Crow thinks and that he has always done everything up until now to see the look of joy on the children's faces and that is his dueling. With that, he decides something. 
 Jack begins his turn and he and Yusei's SPC raises to 7. Jack reminds Yusei that "Stardust Dragon" and "Red Dragon Archfiend" should return at the end of his  Battle Phase  this turn, but he plans to settle this during this same turn where the future Yusei's waiting for lies. Jack attacks Yusei directly with "Crimson Blader". Akiza is surprised to see Jack attacking, when he knows it will let Yusei Summon "Fake Gardna". Yusei proceeds to Summon "Fake Gardna" in Defense Mode, but Jack claims such a trick won't work against him. Jack activates " Breakthrough ", which destroys a monster Summoned during the Battle Phase. "Fake Gardna" is destroyed and its effect removes it from play, so Yusei won't be able to revive it again.
 
         The fan.     
 Jack continues to attack Yusei with "Crimson Blader". However Yusei activates "Scramble Egg". Since a monster he controls was destroyed, he gets to Special Summon " Sonic Chick " from his Deck. He gets it in Defense Mode. "Crimson Blader" attacks "Sonic Chick" instead, but the effect of "Sonic Chick" prevents it from being destroyed by battle by monsters with 1900 ATK or more.
 
         " Stardust Dragon " and " Red Dragon Archfiend " return.     
 Yusei and Jack both pass through a large fan, without getting hit by its blades. The Battle Phase ends and "Stardust Dragon" and "Red Dragon Archfiend" return to the field. Yusei and Jack then exit the tunnel. With the two dragons brought back, Akiza says that this is the future that Yusei spoke of and she wonders just what he is looking for.
 
         Yusei explains how their hearts are connected.     
 Yusei and Jack enter a bridge and Yusei tells Jack how  his father  spoke to him through his heart during his Duel with  Z-one . Everyone is slightly surprised to hear this. Yusei explains that he was told that he still has something to do; Just like the  Ener-D  is held together by the  Planetary Particles , he guides the hearts of others and binds them together. His presence unites people and that's what a "bond" is. Even if all of them part ways, just like the Planetary Particle, he shall be the bond that connects their hearts together, so there is no reason for them to hesitate. They must all stand by themselves and do what they need to do alone. Crow, Akiza, Luna and Leo all weep and say Yusei's name. With Yusei's speech in mind, Jack tells everyone to stand still as he shall rule the world as king. He speeds up and tells Yusei to watch until the very end. Yusei invites him to bring it on and speeds up too.
 Using the effect of " Speed World 2 ", Jack removes his seven  Speed Counters  to draw a card. He gets " Chain Resonator ", which he Summons. Since Yusei controls a Synchro Monster, the effect of "Chain Resonator" lets him Special Summon a " Resonator " Tuner monster from his Deck, so he Summons " Dark Resonator ". Jack performs " Burning Soul " and  double tunes  the Level 8 "Red Dragon Archfiend" to the Level 3 "Dark Resonator" and the Level 1 "Chain Resonator". He chants  "The king and the Devil here and now shall become one. A raging soul. Lift up the very cries of creation itself. Synchro Summon! Come forth, Scar-Red Nova Dragon!" , as he Synchro Summons the Level 12 " Red Nova Dragon ".
 "Red Nova Dragon" gains 500 ATK for every Tuner monster in his Graveyard. He currently has five: "Chain Resonator", "Dark Resonator", "Influence Dragon", " Synchron Resonator " and "Mirror Resonator", so the ATK of "Red Nova Dragon" becomes 6000. Akiza comments that Jack is throwing his entire soul at Yusei and Crow wonders how Yusei will respond.
 
 
 Featured Duel: Yusei Fudo vs. Jack Atlas 
 ...continued from the previous episode 
 Turn 2: Jack 
 Jack  Sets  a card.
 
 Turn 3: Yusei 
 Yusei's hand contains " Triangle Warrior ", " Speed Spell - Defense Buster ", and " Turbo Synchron ". Yusei draws " Quickdraw Synchron ". During the Standby Phase, the effect of " Speed World 2 " activates (Yusei's SPC: 1 → 2, Jack's SPC: 1 → 2). Yusei then  sends  "Turbo Synchron" from his  hand  to the  Graveyard  in order to  Special Summon  "Quickdraw Synchron" ( 5/700/1400) in Attack Position. Yusei then Special Summons two " Triangle Tokens " ( 2/1200/1200 for both) to Jack's side of the field in  Defense Position  in order to Special Summon "Triangle Warrior" ( 2/600/1200) in Attack Position. Yusei then tunes "Triangle Warrior" with "Quickdraw Synchron" in order to  Synchro Summon  " Nitro Warrior " ( 7/2800/1800) in Attack Position while treating "Quickdraw Synchron" as " Nitro Synchron " for the Synchro Summon. Yusei then activates "Speed Spell - Defense Buster" to switch a "Triangle Token" to Attack Position. 
 Yusei plans to use "Nitro Warrior" to attack the Attack Position Triangle Token, which would activate the first effect of "Nitro Warrior" and increase the ATK of "Nitro Warrior" by 1000 during damage calculation only before the token was destroyed. Yusei would then activate the second effect of "Nitro Warrior" to switch the other Triangle Token to Attack Position and use "Nitro Warrior" to attack it, which would end the Duel in an  OTK . "Nitro Warrior" then attacks the  Attack Position  "Triangle Token", but Jack activates his face-down " Break Tune " to Special Summon " Influence Dragon " ( 3/300/900) from his hand in Attack Position and negate the attack.
 
 Turn 4: Jack 
 Jack's hand contains " Mirror Resonator " and " Power Supplier ". Jack draws. During the Standby Phase, the effect of "Speed World 2" activates (Yusei's SPC: 2 → 3, Jack's SPC: 2 → 3). He then tunes his two Triangle Tokens with "Influence Dragon" in order to Synchro Summon " Exploder Dragonwing " ( 7/2400/1600) in Attack Position (Due to the effect of "Influence Dragon", the Triangle Tokens were treated as Dragon-type monsters during the Synchro Summon). Jack then Normal Summons "Power Supplier" ( 2/400/400) in Defense Position. 
 Jack then activates the effect of "Power Supplier" to increase the ATK of "Exploder Dragonwing" by 400 ("Exploder Dragonwing": 2400 → 2800/1600). "Exploder Dragonwing" then attacks "Nitro Warrior". Jack then activates the effect of "Exploder Dragonwing" to destroy "Nitro Warrior" immediately without applying damage calculation and inflicting damage to Yusei equal to the ATK of "Nitro Warrior" (Yusei 4000 → 1200). Jack then Sets a card.
 
 Turn 5: Yusei 
 Yusei draws "Sneak Giant". During the Standby Phase, the effect of "Speed World 2" activates (Yusei's SPC: 3 → 4, Jack's SPC: 3 → 4). Since Jack controls monsters and Yusei doesn't, Yusei Special Summons "Turbo Synchron" ( 1/100/500) from his Graveyard in Attack Position in order to Normal Summon " Sneak Giant " ( 5/0/1900) in Attack Position without Tribute. Yusei then tunes "Sneak Giant" with "Turbo Synchron" in order to Synchro Summon " Turbo Warrior " ( 6/2500/1500) in Attack Position. "Turbo Warrior" then attacks "Exploder Dragonwing". Due to the first effect of "Turbo Warrior", the ATK of "Exploder Dragonwing" is halved until the end of the Damage Step ("Exploder Dragonwing: 2800 → 1400/1600). "Turbo Warrior" then destroys "Exploder Dragonwing" (Jack 4000 → 2900).
 
 Turn 6: Jack 
 Jack draws " Vice Dragon ". During the Standby Phase, the effect of "Speed World 2" activates (Yusei's SPC: 4 → 5, Jack's SPC: 4 → 5). Since Yusei controls a Synchro Monster and Jack doesn't, Jack Special Summons "Mirror Resonator" ( 1/0/0) in Attack Position. Due to the second effect of "Mirror Resonator", its Level becomes equal to the Level of "Turbo Warrior" ("Mirror Resonator":   1 → 6). Jack then tunes "Power Supplier" with "Mirror Resonator" in order to Synchro Summon " Crimson Blader " ( 8/2800/2600) in Attack Position. "Crimson Blader" then attacks and destroys "Turbo Warrior" (Yusei 1200 → 900). Since "Crimson Blader" destroyed a Synchro Monster Yusei controlled in battle, its effect activates, preventing Yusei from summoning any monsters during his next turn.
 
 Turn 7: Yusei 
 Yusei draws " Speed Spell - Angel Baton ". During the Standby Phase, the effect of "Speed World 2" activates (Yusei's SPC: 5 → 6, Jack's SPC: 5 → 6). Yusei then activates "Speed Spell - Angel Baton" to draw two cards ("Fake Gardna" and "Scramble Egg") and send "Fake Gardna" from his hand to the Graveyard. Yusei then Sets a card.
 
 Turn 8: Jack 
 Jack draws " Red Cocoon ". During the Standby Phase, the effect of "Speed World 2" activates (Yusei's SPC: 6 → 7, Jack's SPC: 6 → 7) "Crimson Blader" then attacks directly, but Yusei activates the effect of " Fake Gardna " to Special Summon the latter from his Graveyard ( 4/0/2000) in Defense Position. Jack then activates his face-down " Breakthrough " to destroy Yusei's "Fake Gardna". A  replay  occurs and Jack uses "Crimson Blader" to attack directly, but Yusei activates his face-down " Scramble Egg " to Special Summon " Sonic Chick " ( 1/300/300) from his Deck in Defense Position. A replay occurs and Jack uses "Crimson Blader" to attack "Sonic Chick", but due to the latter's effect, it is not destroyed.
 At the end of the Battle Phase, the effect of Yusei's " Star Excursion " expires and Special Summons " Red Dragon Archfiend " ( 8/3000/2000) and " Stardust Dragon " ( 8/2500/2000) from the  Removed from Play Zone  to their respective owners' side of the field in Attack Position. Jack's hand contains "Vice Dragon" and "Red Cocoon". 
 Jack then activates the effect of "Speed World 2" to remove seven Speed Counters (Jack's SPC: 7 → 0) and draw one card ("Chain Resonator"). Jack then Normal Summons " Chain Resonator " ( 1/100/100) in Attack Position. Jack then activates the effect of "Chain Resonator" to Special Summon " Dark Resonator " ( 3/1300/300) from his Deck in Attack Position. Jack then  double tunes  "Red Dragon Archfiend" with "Chain Resonator" & "Dark Resonator" in order to Synchro Summon " Red Nova Dragon " ( 12/3500/3000) in Attack Position. Due to the first effect of "Red Nova Dragon", it gains 500 ATK for each Tuner Monster in Jack's Graveyard and Jack currently has five ("Red Nova Dragon": 3500 → 6000/3000).
