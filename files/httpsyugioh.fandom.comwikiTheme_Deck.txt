A  Theme Deck  is any Deck whose cards follow a specific pattern or theme, be it one that has mostly monsters from a single  Type , or  Attribute , to those whose cards are part of a greater whole, like a Deck based around " Gate Guardian " or any specific  Archetype . Decks that do not follow a theme are called  Cookie Cutter  decks.
