 Domino University  is a university in  Domino City  in the  Yu-Gi-Oh!  manga .
 
 Events 
 Professor Yoshimori  worked at the university in the archaeology department. In 1996, they were part of a team that discovered a Pharaoh's tomb in the  Valley of the Kings  from the New Kingom Era, around 1580-1314 B.C. [1] 
 After the death of  Curator Kanekura , who sponsored the exhibition,  Yugi Mutou  and his friends went to the archaeology department to cheer up Yoshimori.  Shadi , who had killed Kanekura for defiling the tomb was planning on judging whether or not Yoshimori should be similarly punished. However when he saw that Yugi was coming to see Yoshimori, he instead decided to use Yoshimori as a puppet in a  Shadow Game  to test if Yugi was worthy of the  Millennium Puzzle . [2]  Shadi set up the  Trial of the Mind  Shadow Game on the roof of the university and played a number of games with  Dark Yugi , while putting his friends in danger around the University. [3]
