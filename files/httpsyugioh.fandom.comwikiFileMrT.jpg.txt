 Biography 
       Linework     
 Trueman initially appears to dispose of  Honest , a Duel Spirit who disguised himself as a long-missing  Obelisk Blue  student,  Yusuke Fujiwara , only to be stopped by  Jaden Yuki . Recognizing Jaden as a threat, Trueman attempts to destroy Jaden, only to be thwarted every time and retreats, promising to return. Trueman proves a difficult opponent for Jaden each time they Duel. In the first Duel Jaden won fairly easily but came very close to losing the second. Before their third rematch multiple Trueman(s) appear and they assimilate together to dispatch Jaden, considering him as a threat to their agenda. Jaden nearly loses this one, but manages to win using the card " Honest ". 
 
       Trueman pulls  Tsutomu  into the  World of Darkness .     
 He later revives his machination and initiates a vicious assault on  Duel Academy  and  Domino City , absorbing people into the  World of Darkness  by materializing through the cards of Duelists who have felt negative emotions and assuming their form, but not before eliminating the original. Additionally, when he does this, everyone who knew the person forgets they ever existed. Among the victims were  Daigo Sorano ,  Axel Brodie ,  Sartorius ,  Sarina ,  Tyranno Hassleberry , and almost the entire population of  Domino City  and the students of Duel Academy. Names from a list of  his victims , including many characters from the  first series anime  and  manga , all disappear from the list leaving only  Seto Kaiba 's name behind. 
 To defeat Axel Brodie, Trueman copied the Deck and appearance of Brodie's  father  and exploits Brodie's negative emotions relating to an incident that nearly killed both of his parents. Many copies of Brodie later attempt to stop Jaden Yuki's escape from Domino City, but Jaden escapes them. However, many copies of Jaden then try to stop Jaden, but he is rescued by Sartorius.
 After defeating  Daigo Sorano , Trueman begins to imitate both Sorano's Deck and appearance, enabling him to blend in with the other students of Duel Academy before finding his next victim, growing stronger with every Duel. Each individual Trueman clone was capable of doing this, and so each of them would seek out students to defeat, among them being  Tyranno Hassleberry  and  Syrus Truesdale . He later assumes his true form once more and defeats  Chazz Princeton ,  Mindy ,  Jasmine , and  Alexis Rhodes  as well as a majority of the students.
 The Trueman clones observed the Duel between  Yusuke Fujiwara  and  Atticus Rhodes  as well as the Duel between Yusuke, Jaden, and  Jesse Anderson . During Jaden's Duel with  Yusuke Fujiwara , all the Trueman clones are destroyed by " Rainbow Neos " when it attacks and destroys " Clear Vicious Knight " and the portion of  Nightshroud  that was possessing Yusuke.
 
 Abilities 
 Trueman demonstrates numerous abilities during the season, the most notable being able to manifest from cards tainted with darkness, as he mentions he's a being of pure emotion. He can transform into different people and replicate their Decks. When he Duels against a particular person, he can manipulate the memories of his opponents in an attempt to psychologically weaken them.
 He has also shown the ability to teleport, create duplicates of himself, manipulate objects, and hypnotize people.
 
 Personality 
 Trueman takes great pleasure in making his opponents believe that they have darkness in their hearts. He duels with the purpose of using other's insecurities against them while taking sadistic pleasure in doing so. His methods have been effective against all of Duel Academy with the exception of Jaden. He does not care about the fate of the world, only dueling just to break others spirts.
 
 Deck 
 Main article:  Trueman's Decks 
 Trueman  plays a variety of Decks as he has the ability to manifest himself out of piles of random cards. To maintain consistency, he frequently runs " Dark Archetype " as a front-runner – this can be considered his one consistently used card. In addition, he can copy the Decks of Duelists he defeats, and as such also uses a broad spectrum of constructed Decks.
 In his duels against Jaden, he plays in a similar manner to  Yami Bakura : Summoning weaker monsters at the beginning in order to bait the opponent and then surprise him.
