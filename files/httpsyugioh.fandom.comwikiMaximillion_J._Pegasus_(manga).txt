 Maximillion J. Pegasus , known as  Pegasus J. Crawford  in the Japanese version is a character in the  Yu-Gi-Oh!  manga . This is the original depiction of  Pegasus , created by  Kazuki Takahashi . With the exception of two occasions where he is called Pegasus J. Crawford, [2] [3]  he is one of the few human characters to not use his original Japanese name in the English manga.
 Pegasus is depicted as a well-mannered, yet overly dramatic man obsessed with cartoons, concealing the appearance of a ruthless businessman and gamer, yet man of his word. His motives stem from the death of his lover,  Cyndia . His fascination with Egyptian beliefs in life after death led to him obtaining the  Millennium Eye  and creating the  Duel Monsters  card game. He attempted to  take control  of  KaibaCorp  to use their  Solid Vision  technology to create a lifelike version of Cyndia. The takeover plan involved him hosting the  Duelist Kingdom  tournament to defeat  Yugi Mutou . However his defeat against Yugi led to the failure of his plan and his murder at the hands of  Dark Bakura .
 Yu-Gi-Oh! R  explores more of Pegasus' life; particularly how he had taken care of a number of orphans. One of them,  Yako Tenma , blamed Yugi for Pegasus' death and arranged  Project R.A.  in an attempt to resurrect him.

 Biography 
   Some of the following events are from  Yu-Gi-Oh! R , which is of disputed canon. 
 Childhood and Cyndia 
 Pegasus' father was a wealthy man, who managed casinos in Las Vegas. [4]  While Pegasus was growing up, he watched  Funny Rabbit  every Saturday morning and considered its characters to be his best friends at the time. [5] 
 
       Pegasus meets  Cyndia .     
 Around the age of 10, while attending a social function, he met  Cyndia , the daughter of one of his father's friends. The two fell in love and spent a lot of time together. They would often talk about their dreams, with Pegasus aspiring to be an artist who would travel around the world. They swore to spend their lives together. Shortly after Pegasus turned 17, Cyndia got sick and died also at the age of 17, causing Pegasus to fall into a state of depression. [4] 
 
 
 Acquiring the Millennium Eye 
       Pegasus spies on  Shadi  testing  the thief .     
 Shortly after Cyndia's death, Pegasus became interested in the ancient Egyptian beliefs in life after death and traveled to Egypt to learn more. He visited the  Valley of the Kings . Inside the village,  Kul Elna , he saw  a thief  about to be prosecuted for stealing the  Millennium Ring . Fearing for the thief's safety, Pegasus offered to buy the Ring with all the money he had in exchange for the man being let go. However  Shadi  appeared and advised him not to flaunt his wealth in that area. He explained that the man was to be punished for the theft and the value of the Ring was irrelevant, but priceless. Shadi warned Pegasus that thieves were a common sight in the village, suggested that he leave and added that it was not a place where the sadness of losing a lost one is healed. [4] 
 
         Pegasus, briefly reunited with Cyndia.     
 Pegasus was surprised that Shadi seemed to have read his mind, so he secretly followed him and the other prosecutors. They went to an underground temple where they put the thief on trial to see if he was chosen by the Ring. The ring was put on him, which resulted in his body burning up, killing him. Pegasus was caught spying on the ritual and taken down to Shadi. He begged to be let go and promised not to tell anyone what he had seen. However he was only permitted to leave if he became bearer of a Millennium Item, so he was to be tested by the  Millennium Eye . If he were deemed worthy, Shadi said he would be granted his dearest wish. The other men cut out Pegasus left eye and inserted the Millennium Eye in its socket. Pegasus passed the test and for a moment was embraced by an apparition of Cyndia. [4] 
 At some point, Pegasus painted portraits of Shadi and Cyndia, which he hung up in  his castle , but did not like to talk about them. [6] 
 
 Duel Monsters  work 
 While in the  Valley of the Kings , Pegasus also heard legends of Egyptian magicians, who had power to seal monsters in stone tablets and summon them to fight battles. He created the card game  Duel Monsters  as a means of bringing these ancient games to the modern world. [7]  Pegasus founded the company  Industrial Illusions  and established himself as a young genius game designer on creating  Duel Monsters , [8]  Among the cards he created were the three  Egyptian Gods , though he was unable to translate the Hieratic Text that referred to " The Sun Dragon Ra " specifically, and he was forced to print it on the card in an ink only visible under the light emitted from "Ra" when Summoned (possibly inferring that he created them after the development of the Solid Vision technology). He regarded their creation as his greatest mistake as three cards gained power as if the gods dwelled within them, making them powerful weapons. He tried to destroy the God Cards, but could not bring himself to do it, so he had the Egyptian supreme council of antiquities bury the cards in different locations in the Valley of the Kings. [9]  Pegasus also designed the  Wicked Gods , but refrained from creating them for the same reason he regretted creating the Egyptian Gods. [10] 
 Duel Monsters  became a huge success in the United States, with players said to be in excess of twenty million and many tournaments hosted with large prizes. [11]  He received an offer from  KaibaCorp  to develop  Virtual Simulation Battle Boxes  together, to enhance the experience of playing  Duel Monsters . [8] 
 
         Pegasus calls for  Tom  to take over in his Duel against  Keith Howard .     
 The United States top  Card Professor ,  Keith Howard  challenged Pegasus to  a Duel . Pegasus was not interested at first, but accepted under the conditions that the prize was to be one million dollars, the Duel was to take place in a stadium capable of holding fifty thousand people and broadcast nationwide with earnings split between sponsors and TV stations. The Duel was to take place in the  New York Duel Stadium . Before it began, Pegasus took the time to teach some children present how to play  Duel Monsters . He gave one of the children,  Tom , a Deck of cards as he could not afford to build a good one of his own. When the Duel began, Pegasus performed a  Mind Scan  on Keith and wrote instructions on a piece of paper. He then called Tom to the Duel and gave him the paper, telling him to follow the instructions and he would win. In the meantime, Pegasus sat with his guest,  Seto Kaiba  from KaibaCorp and accepted his offer to develop the Battle Boxes. When Tom defeated Keith, Pegasus took him to the camera and advertised  Duel Monsters  as a game where even a beginner can beat a strong champion, effectively turning the Duel into a commercial. [11] 
 Pegasus grew fond of the  Solid Vision  technology KaibaCorp was developing. It was capable of creating projections that were more lifelike than simple holograms. He hoped to takeover KaibaCorp, so he could have the technology and use it to create a lifelike projection of Cyndia. [12]  He got a number of his employees work at KaibaCorp as spies, [13]  including  Saruwatari . [8] 
 Pegasus took in a number of orphans, including  Yako Tenma ,  Gekko Tenma ,  Depre Scott  and  Richie Merced , as protégés to be potential heirs to Industrial Illusions, while raising the others to be professional gamers and designers.
 
 
 Duelist Kingdom 
         Pegasus meeting the  Big Five .     
 When  Seto Kaiba  was left in a coma after losing to  Yugi Mutou  in  Death-T ,  KaibaCorp  shares began to plummet. With the company in a bad state and Kaiba out of action, Pegasus seized the chance try and  take over it . He made a deal with the company's leading stock holders, the  Big Five , in which he could buy the position of chief executive if he defeated Yugi Mutou in an official game of  Duel Monsters  in order to rebuild the company's reputation. [8] 
 To defeat Yugi Mutou, Pegasus organized the  Duelist Kingdom   Duel Monsters  tournament. [8]  It was to place on his island, which shared its name,  Duelist Kingdom . Participants were given 2  Star Chips  to wager in Duels in the  battle royal  format preliminary stages. [14]  The Duels were to take place in  Battle Boxes  scattered across the island, granting different  Field Power Sources  based on their location. [15]  Duelists who acquire 10 Star Chips would earn the right to enter  his castle . [14]  Pegasus also hired  Player Killers  to try and defeat Yugi in the preliminary stage [16]  and win Star Chips from the regular participants, so that no more than four finalists could enter the castle. [17]  The finalists would participate in a  knockout stage  with the winner facing Pegasus. [18]  If they could defeat him, they would win $200,000 US. [19] 
 Invitations were sent to Duelists  Industrial Illusions  deemed to be the best in Japan., [20]  including one to Yugi, along with  an 8 mm videotape . Pegasus also appeared at the finals of the  Japanese National  Duel Monsters  Championship , where he congratulated the winner  Insector Haga , and personally invited him to the tournament. [21]  Pegasus arranged  the boat ride  to the island. [20] 
 
         Pegasus  Duels   Dark Yugi  through the TV.     
 When Yugi played the videotape Pegasus sent him, Pegasus appeared on screen and, despite claiming to be a prerecording, challenged him to  a Duel  to test his skill. Using his  mind reading skills , Pegasus predicted and countered Yugi's moves. Upon realizing the Duel was a  Shadow Game ,  Dark Yugi  took over from Yugi. [21]  Dark Yugi suspected the video contained subliminal messages telling him what cards to play, allowing Pegasus to prerecord moves to respond perfectly. Dark Yugi ignored his subconscious decision for one move, which resulted in Pegasus counteracting with a weaker monster. [22]  However the video footage showed Pegasus' monster being destroyed and Pegasus claimed to have known that would happen and took the hit on purpose. With limited footage left on the tape, Pegasus imposed a 15 minute time limit. In the last few seconds, Dark Yugi's victory was apparent, but the time ran out, making Pegasus win due to having higher  Life Points . As Dark Yugi's  Penalty Game  and a means of ensuring he would take part in Duelist Kingdom, Pegasus sealed the soul of  Sugoroku Mutou  in the videotape. He then showed Dark Yugi the  Millennium Eye , explaining he had used it to read his mind. [23] 
 Two nights before the tournament, the Big Five kidnapped  Mokuba Kaiba  and brought him to Pegasus' island as he had swallowed the key to a safe with documents they needed to complete their deal with Pegasus. [8] 
 
         Pegasus discusses his plans with  Yako Tenma .     
 The day before the tournament, Pegasus discussed his plans with  Yako Tenma . [10] 
 When the tournament began, Pegasus appeared before the participants and explained some of the tournament rules. [14]  Some time after Mokuba had been recaptured after an escape, Pegasus stripped Mokuba's soul from his body and sealed it in a " Soul Prison " card. [24]  During the night of the first day, Pegasus heard word that Kaiba had woken from his coma and was coming towards the island. He was confident Kaiba would not make it to the island, as he had two spies on the same helicopter. However Kaiba managed to overpower them. [13]  When Kaiba arrived on the island, he was refused permission to speak to Pegasus, so he took his adviser,  Croquet , hostage. After receiving word that Yugi had collected ten Star Chips, Pegasus made contact with Kaiba. He agreed to return Mokuba to Kaiba under the condition that Yugi first defeat Yugi in a Duel. He got Saruwatari to give Kaiba five Star Chips Mokuba had stolen and instructed Kaiba to wager them in his Duel against Yugi. [25]  Kaiba won  the Duel  and was able to use his ten Star Chips to enter the castle to face Pegasus. [26] 
 
         Pegasus nominates  Mokuba 's "shell" to hold his  Duel Disk .     
 The four finalists,  Keith Howard ,  Mai Kujaku , Yugi and  Katsuya Jonouchi  qualified in time to watch the Duel between Kaiba and Pegasus. [27]  Kaiba insisted that they Duel using his  Duel Disks , [24]  something he had designed as a means of combating Pegasus' mind reading. [28]  However Pegasus thought it would be unwise to fight on his opponent's terms, so he complained about the degree of fitness needed to operate one and agreed to use the Duel Disks only if Mokuba's soulless body would act as a proxy and throw his Duel Disk. Kaiba refused to fight his brother, so he agreed to Duel Pegasus without the use of Duel Disks. [24] 
 
         Pegasus traps  Kaiba 's soul in a " Soul Prison ".     
 By reading Kaiba's mind, Pegasus knew when he was about to Summon " Blue-Eyes White Dragon " and used the card " Prophecy " to easily take the card from him. [24]  Pegasus also foresaw Kaiba's " Saggi the Dark Clown " and " Crush Card " combo and used " Negative Energy " to make "Saggi" too strong to hold the virus, killing the virus. Pegasus then used " Toon World " to turn his monsters, including the "Blue-Eyes White Dragon" he took, into cartoon versions of themselves, capable of dodging attacks. To avoid having his mind read, Kaiba discarded his  hand  and played cards straight from the top of his Deck, which did not make any major difference, as Pegasus had read Kaiba's subconscious memorization of his own Deck to produce counter-strategies for any possible incoming threats. [5]  Kaiba managed to defeat the cartoon version of "Blue-Eyes White Dragon" with a combination of " Shadow Spell " and another "Blue-Eyes White Dragon". However, Pegasus captured the new "Blue-Eyes White Dragon" in " Dragon Capture Jar ". Kaiba tried to attack " Dragon Piper " to stop it Summoning "Blue-Eyes White Dragon" from the jar, but Pegasus used " Doppelganger " to copy Kaiba's "Crush Card", infecting "Dragon Piper". Once the piper was destroyed, Kaiba's Deck was infected, killing everything with more than 1500  ATK . Now only able to revive "Saggi the Dark Clown", Kaiba was easily finished off. [29]  Pegasus then inflicted the "Mind Card" Penalty Game on Kaiba, trapping his soul in another "Soul Prison" card. [18] 
 Pegasus arranged a  dinner party  for the tournament finalists [18]  and placed  Millennium Eye replicas  in their soup. Each eye had a slip of paper with a letter on it to determine the match up for the finals. When the finalists discovered the eyes in their soup, Pegasus appeared on a screen and explained the rules of the bingo game, which resulted in Yugi and Mai being paired up for the first semi final and Keith and Jonouchi being paired up for the second. [6] 
 On the day of the finals, Pegasus showed the finalists the prize money and had it explained that they would need to defeat him to get it. He watched  the Duel  between Dark Yugi and Mai [19]  and was impressed by the flawlessness of Mai's " Harpy " Deck. [30]  By reading their thoughts, he confirmed Mai's accusation that Dark Yugi was distracted by the thought of Dueling him, [31]  was able to detect Dark Yugi's change in spirit [32]  and predict Mai's surrender. [33] 
 As Pegasus watched  Keith and Jonouchi's Duel , he noted how Jonouchi was not even close to Keith in terms of experience, strategy or Deck strength and wondered how Jonouchi had turned the tables in his favor. He read their minds, finding despair and revenge in Keith's and hope and trust in Jonouchi's. He described the Duel as a fight between light and darkness. [34]  He also spotted Keith cheating during the Duel. [35] 
 
         Pegasus inflicts a  Penalty Game  on Keith.     
 Aware of how Yugi and Jonouchi planned on having Dark Yugi face Pegasus and give the prize money to Jonouchi, Pegasus deemed a final Duel between Yugi and Jonouchi pointless and had the Duel stage prepared for  his Duel  with Yugi. Before entering the Duel stage, he was confronted by Keith, who held out a knife and demanded that he be given the prize money. Pegasus called Keith out on cheating in his last Duel and inflicted the "Hand Gun" Penalty Game on him, causing his hand to turn into a gun and shot himself in the head. [35] 
 Before they Dueled, Dark Yugi said that if he won he wanted Pegasus to release the souls of Sugoroku, Mokuba and Kaiba. Pegasus thought it was odd that Yugi wanted to save Kaiba, but accepted the condition. He was impressed that Dark Yugi accepted the Duel, knowing his soul would be trapped in a card if he lost. Croquet then informed Pegasus that having scanned Mokuba they would be able to make a duplicate of the key he swallowed shortly, meaning defeating the Yugis was the last thing Pegasus needed to do to take control of KaibaCorp. [36] 
 
         Pegasus performing a  Mind Scan .     
 Like in their last Duel, Pegasus was able to predict and appropriately prepare for Dark Yugi's moves. He also used " Toon World " to convert his monsters into cartoon versions. [37]  However Yugi established a  Mind Shuffle  strategy, wherein he and Dark Yugi would switch control between moves without telling each other what they were planning or what cards they played  face-down . This way, Pegasus could not read the mind of whichever Yugi made the last move. This made him unable to find which of the " Magical Hats " " Dark Magician " was under. Instead he used " Magic Neutralizing Force " to remove the hats and attacked "Dark Magician". However Yugi used " Living Arrow " to transfer the effect of "Magic Neutralizing Force" to Pegasus, removing the effect of "Toon World" and then used "Mirror Force" to reflect the attack back at Pegasus' monsters. Without the effect of "Toon World", the monsters could not dodge the attack and were destroyed. [38] 
 
         Pegasus turns the Duel into a  Shadow Game .     
 Pegasus switched the nature of the Duel to a  Shadow Game , making it difficult for normal mortals to physically endure. He used his eye-themed cards from that point and got " Relinquished " to absorb the Yugis' "Dark Magician" and " Winged Dragon, Guardian of the Fortress ". The pressure of the Shadow Game proved too much for Yugi, who collapsed on playing his final card face-down. [7]  Pegasus Summoned " Jigen Bakudan ", which would self-destruct and destroy his monsters, including those absorbed by "Relinquished", depleting Dark Yugi's remaining Life Points. He tried to use his Mind Scan when Dark Yugi drew his next card. However he was blocked by an apparition of Yugi's friends. Dark Yugi used " Mystic Box " to swap the positions of his absorbed "Dark Magician" and Pegasus unabsorbed "Jigen Bakudan". He used " Brain Control " to take control of "Relinquished" with its absorbed monsters and then used Yugi's last card " Dark Magic Ritual " to sacrifice "Jigen Bakudan" and "Winged Dragon, Guardian of the Fortress" to Summon " Magician of Black Chaos ". [39] 
 Pegasus was surprised to see that someone actually uses " Kuriboh " when Dark Yugi Summoned it. When "Relinquished" returned to his control, he fused it with " Thousand-Eyes Idol " to create " Thousand-Eyes Restrict ". "Thousand-Eyes Restrict" paralyzed Dark Yugi's monsters and attempted to absorb "Magician of Black Chaos". However Dark Yugi used " Multiply " to create a swarm of "Kuribohs", which instead got absorbed. The effect of "Kuriboh" caused it to explode on impart, blinding each of the eyes. This freed "Magician of Black Chaos" from its paralysis, allowing it to attack and destroy "Thousand-Eyes Restrict", defeating Pegasus. [40] 
 With his defeat, Pegasus is unable to take control of KaibaCorp. In keeping his promise, he freed the souls of Sugoroku and the two Kaiba brothers and assured Dark Yugi he would get his prize money. He was impressed by the power of the Millennium Puzzle and asked if Dark Yugi was not aware of the evil intelligence possessed by the  Millennium Items . He then told Dark Yugi the story of how he lost Cyndia and acquired the Millennium Eye. He learned Shadi's name from Yugi as he told the story. [4]  Having come from a Millennium Item and not wanting to be regarded as an evil intelligence, Dark Yugi refrained from inflicting a Penalty Game on Pegasus. [12] 
 
         Pegasus' death.     
 Before Yugi, his friends and the Kaiba brothers left the island, Pegasus was confronted by  Dark Bakura , who pulled the Millennium Eye out of his socket, killing him. He left Pegasus with one of the replica Millennium Eyes from the soup, telling him to take it with him to Hell. [12] 
 
 
 Post death 
         Pegasus' brief appearance in R.     
 Pegasus' heir,  Yako Tenma , found Pegasus' blood splattered over the table where he had been killed. He wept his death and was told by  Croquet  that  Yugi Mutou  was responsible. [10]  Yako took over as president of Industrial Illusions sometime afterwards and began developing  Project R.A.  in an attempt to revive Pegasus.
 A few months after Pegasus' death,  Esper Roba  who pretended to have  ESP , claimed that he was using his powers to communicate with the spirit of Pegasus. [3] 
 Some time after the  Battle City  tournament, Yako forced Yugi to partake in Project R.A. by kidnapping  Anzu Mazaki . His primary goal was to sacrifice Anzu's body to house Pegasus' soul. Pegasus' spirit was temporarily revived, but  Seto Kaiba  was able to stop the Duel Ring server, and Pegasus' spirit vanished, saving Anzu's life and infuriating Yako. During the final stages of the Duel between Dark Yugi and Yako, when " The God of the Obelisk " clashed with " The Wicked Avatar ", Yako caught a glimpse of Pegasus' spirit once more, but Pegasus' did not so much as turn around to face Yako before vanishing a final time.

 When  Trageodia  accessed the memories of " Winged Kuriboh ", he saw Pegasus, as he was the one who made Winged Kuriboh into  a card . [41] 
 
 Deck 
 Main article:  Maximillion Pegasus' Decks 
 Pegasus uses a Deck containing cards he created exclusively for himself. These include " Toon World ", which turns all his monsters into near invulnerable cartoon versions of themselves and a number of eye-themed cards, which paralyze and absorb opposing monsters. He utilizes " Dragon Capture Jar " and " Dragon Piper " in combination to overcome  Seto Kaiba 's " Blue-Eyes White Dragon " cards.
 He makes use of his  Millennium Eye 's mind reading powers to predict and counter opponents' strategies and exploit cards like " Prophecy ", which usually require guess work.
