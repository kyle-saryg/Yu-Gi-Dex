      Mokuka  faces  Yugi  in the hideout.     
 Mokuba's gang's hideout  was an abandoned warehouse, in the  Yu-Gi-Oh!  manga , in which  Mokuba Kaiba  and  his gang  would hang out in.
 
 Events 
 Mokuba's gang met  Yugi Mutou  outside  Old Man Dentures' candy store . By threatening him with weapons, they forced Yugi to come to their hideout. They brought the  Capsule Monster Chess   dispenser  from outside the store with them, with Mokuba paying off  Old Man Dentures  as they did so.
 At the hideout, Mokuba's followers provoked Yugi, causing him to change to  Dark Yugi . Mokuba had hoped for this as he wanted to face Dark Yugi to get revenge for him inflicting a  Penalty Game  on  Seto Kaiba . He challenged Dark Yugi to a game of  Capsule Monster Chess  with the condition that if Mokuba won, he could cut off one of Yugi's fingers. Dark Yugi accepted under the condition that Mokuba would receive a  Penalty Game  if Dark Yugi won. Using the dispenser, which had previously been tampered with, Mokuba and Dark Yugi took turns getting monsters to use from it. The rigged dispenser gave Mokuba high Level monsters and Dark Yugi low Level ones. However Dark Yugi was still able to win  the game  and leave the hideout safely.
