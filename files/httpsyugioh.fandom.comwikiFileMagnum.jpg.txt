 Biography 
 Sometime in the past, Mai defeated him in a Duel. Impressed, he proposed to her, but she walked away in disgust, telling him to ask her again when he could beat her in Duel Monsters.
 Magnum entered  Battle City  and won five  Locator Cards . Needing six to qualify for the finals, he challenged Mai to a Duel for a final Locator Card and the right to marry her. When he lost, he used Hollywood stunts and special effects in an attempt to kidnap her. He was stopped by  Joey Wheeler . This confrontation revealed he was a coward at heart. When Mai was in danger, he panicked and asked for his stunt double to help him. After Joey rescued her, Mai berated Magnum and ordered him to leave, and he reluctantly did.
 
 Voice and Mannierisms 
 He speaks very calm. In the japanese version he uses the personal pronoun "watashi", also, he uses the american expression "D'Oh" (from "The Simpsons") when frustrated. Which may be a representation of his american origin or just a coincidence.
 
 Deck
