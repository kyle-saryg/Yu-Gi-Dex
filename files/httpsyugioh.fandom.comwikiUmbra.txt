 Biography 
 He, along with  Lumis , was ordered by  Marik Ishtar  to Duel  Seto Kaiba  and  Yami Yugi  in a Tag-Team Duel. They were Dueling atop a skyscraper and each player is standing on glass. The loser's glass will shatter and will fall to the bottom of the skyscraper, murdering the loser (in the dub, a "vortex" will open and the loser's mind will be sent to the  Shadow Realm ). During the Duel, Lumis and Umbra heavily relied on teamwork, unlike Kaiba and Yugi, and were using a " Mask " Deck, preventing them from Tributing monsters to Summon Kaiba's " Obelisk ", or Yugi's " Slifer ". However, Kaiba used " Soul Exchange " to Tribute Umbra's monsters, who were originally Yugi's monsters, to Summon "Obelisk". He then defeated Umbra with "Obelisk". The glass shattered, due to him losing. However, he survived when he opened up a parachute to land on a pole.

 Deck 
 Main article:  Lumis and Umbra's Decks 
 Umbra and Lumis play Mask-themed God Seal Decks, that weaken and manipulate the opponent's cards while lowering their opponent's  Life Points . Umbra plays a Deck with more  Monster Cards  while Lumis plays a Deck with more  Spell  and  Trap Cards . They also rely on teamwork to support each other, while taking down the opponents. When provoked by Kaiba, coupled with several slip-ups, their teamwork faltered, leading them to defeat.
 
 Trivia 
 His name is Latin for " shadow ". 
 Unlike his counterpart Lumis, Umbra has never had a design that stuck. His appearance differs from the games and anime. Notable differences include darker skin tone in, and has a more rectangular head when compared to his anime incarnation.
