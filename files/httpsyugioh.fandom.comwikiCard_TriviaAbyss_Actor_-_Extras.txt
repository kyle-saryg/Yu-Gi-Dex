 This monster appears in the card artwork of " Abyss Playhouse - Fantastic Theater " and " Abyss Actors' Curtain Call ". 
 This monster's name is derived from the  acting  term, an " extra " being a background actor who appears in a nonspeaking capacity.
 This role is reflected in its  effect ; moving from the  Pendulum Zone  to the  Monster Zone  when needed with no other effects (in the anime) and  Tributing  itself to recruit a another " Abyss Actor " into the Pendulum Zone, essentially leaving the stage to give a main character the limelight (in the  TCG / OCG ).
