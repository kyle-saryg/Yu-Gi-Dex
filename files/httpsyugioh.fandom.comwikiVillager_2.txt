 Villager 2  is one of the villagers who goes to the Dueling Grounds in  Yu-Gi-Oh! Forbidden Memories .
 He meets the  prince  at the Dueling Grounds, although he is unaware of his royal status.
 He also appears in The Falsebound Kingdom as a Marshal named Malairuka. He is the first boss of Kaiba's campaign.
 
 Deck 
 One of Villager 2's best combos is to fuse his " Pumpking the King of Ghosts " with a Dragon to Summon " Curse of Dragon ".
But, apparently, he doesn't have a normal deck, but a random one, which forms new before every duel. This way his best/strongest combo is to fuse the " Double-Headed Thunder Dragon ".
