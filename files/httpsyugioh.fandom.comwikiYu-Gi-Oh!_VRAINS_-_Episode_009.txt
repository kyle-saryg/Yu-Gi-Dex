It first aired in Japan on July 12, 2017, and will air on Teletoon on September 29, 2018. It became available with official subtitles via Crunchyroll on the same day. Pluto TV premiered the English dub on December 18, 2020 in the US.
 In order to obtain the program that removes the virus that infected  Skye ,  Yusaku  commences a Duel against  Varis , with the AI, who is also known as  Ai , as a wager. Using the  Link Monsters  he obtained in his previous  Duels , Playmaker was able to destroy Varis' " Cracking Dragon ". However, the back-and-forth Duel between them takes a new turn as Varis activates a shocking  Skill !
 
 Featured Duel: Playmaker vs. Varis 
         
 The Duel is conducted as a  Speed Duel .
 Turn 1: Varis 
 Varis  pays 1000  LP  to activate the  Continuous Spell  " Dragonoid Generator " (Varis: 4000 → 3000 LP). Now, up to twice per turn, Varis can  Special Summon  a " Dragonoid Token " during his  Main Phase  though he cannot Special Summon from his Extra Deck for the rest of the turn. Varis  Special Summons  2 "Dragonoid Tokens" (300/300 each). Varis Tributes both "Dragonoid Tokens" to  Tribute Summon  " Cracking Dragon " (3000/0).
 During the  End Phase , the effect of "Dragonoid Generator" Special Summons "Dragonoid Tokens" to  Playmaker 's field equal to the number of "Dragonoid Tokens" Summoned by Varis this turn. Two "Dragonoid Tokens" (300/300 each) are Special Summoned to Playmaker's field. The effect of "Cracking Dragon" activates as a monster was Normal or Special Summoned, decreasing the ATK of the monster by 200 x its Level until the  End Phase  and inflicting the same amount of  damage  to Playmaker ("Dragonoid Tokens": 300 → 100/300; Playmaker: 4000 → 3600 LP).
 Turn 2: Playmaker 
Playmaker uses a "Dragonoid Token" to  Link Summon  " Link Spider " (1000/LINK-1/↓) to the  Extra Monster Zone . Playmaker activates the effect of "Link Spider", Special Summoning a Level 4 or lower Normal Monster from his hand. He Special Summons " Bitron " (200/2000) in  Attack Position . The effect of "Cracking Dragon" activates ("Bitron": 200 → 0; Playmaker: 3600 → 3400 LP). As Playmaker controls a  Cyberse  monster, he Special Summons " Backup Secretary " by its own effect (1200/800). The effect of "Cracking Dragon" activates ("Backup Secretary": 1200 → 600; Playmaker: 3400 → 2800 LP).
 Playmaker uses "Bitron" and "Backup Secretary" to Link Summon " Honeybot " (1900/LINK-2/←→) to the zone "Link Spider"  points to . Playmaker then uses the Link-1 "Link Spider" and the Link-2 "Honeybot" to Link Summon " Decode Talker " (2300/LINK-3/↙↑↘) to the Extra Monster Zone. "Decode Talker" gains 500 ATK for each monster linked to it ("Decode Talker": 2300 → 2800). Playmaker Tributes the other "Dragonoid Token" to Tribute Summon " Capacitor Stalker " (2000/1000) to the zone bottom-left of "Decode Talker". As "Capacitor Stalker" was  Normal  or Special Summoned, Playmaker activates its effect, allowing him to increase the ATK of a Cyberse monster he controls by 800 while "Capacitor Stalker" remains  face-up  on the  field . He targets "Decode Talker" ("Decode Talker": 2800 → 3600). The effect of "Cracking Dragon" activates ("Capacitor Stalker": 2000 → 1000; Playmaker: 2800 → 1800 LP). Playmaker  Sets  a card.
 "Decode Talker" attacks "Cracking Dragon". As Link Monsters do not have Levels, the effect of "Cracking Dragon" that pervents it from being destroyed by monsters with a Level less than or equal to it does not apply. Hence, "Cracking Dragon" is destroyed (Varis: 3000 → 2400 LP). "Capacitor Stalker" attacks directly (Varis: 2400 → 1400).
 Turn 3: Varis 
Varis draws a card and subsequently Sets it. As Playmaker controls a Link Monster, Varis Special Summons " Gateway Dragon " (1600/1400) by its effect. Varis activates the effect of "Gateway Dragon", allowing him to Special Summon a Level 4 or lower  DARK  monster from his hand. He Special Summons " Sniffer Dragon " (800/400). As "Sniffer Dragon" was Special Summoned, Varis can add another copy of "Sniffer Dragon" from his  Deck  to his hand. He adds and subsequently Normal Summons another copy of "Sniffer Dragon" (1600/1400).
 Varis uses a "Sniffer Dragon" and "Gateway Dragon" to Link Summon " Twin Triangle Dragon " (1200/LINK-2/↓→) to the Extra Monster Zone. Varis activates the effect of "Twin Triangle Dragon", allowing him to pay 500 LP to Special Summon a Level 5 or higher monster from his  GY  with its effects negated. Varis Special Summons "Cracking Dragon" to the zone below "Twin Triangle Dragon" (Varis: 1400 → 900 LP).
 Varis activates his Skill "Storm Access", which allows him to randomly access a card from a Data Storm when his LP is 1000 or less. Varis obtains " Topologic Bomber Dragon " and adds it to his  Extra Deck .
 Varis uses the Link-2 "Twin Triangle Dragon", "Cracking Dragon" and "Sniffer Dragon" to Link Summon "Topologic Bomber Dragon" (3000/LINK-4/↑↙↓↘) to the Extra Monster Zone. Varis activates the effect of "Dragonoid Generator" to Special Summon a "Dragonoid Token" to a zone "Bomber Dragon" points. As a monster was Special Summoned to a zone a Link Monster points to, the effect of "Bomber Dragon" activates, destroying all monsters in the Main Monster Zones. The "Dragnoid Token" and "Capacitor Stalker" are destroyed ("Decode Talker": 3600 → 2300). As "Capacitor Stalker" was destroyed by a card effect, its effect activates, inflicting 800 damage to both players (Playmaker: 1800 → 1000 LP; Varis: 900 → 100 LP). 
 "Bomber Dragon" attacks and destroys "Decode Talker" (Playmaker: 1000 → 300 LP). As "Bomber Dragon" attacked Playmaker's monster, its effect activates, inflicting damage equal to the attacked monster's  original ATK .
 Duel continues in the next episode .
