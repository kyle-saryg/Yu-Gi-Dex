 Yu-Gi-Oh! SEVENS  is the seventh  Yu-Gi-Oh!  anime series succeeding  Yu-Gi-Oh! VRAINS , and the sixth main spin-off series which began airing in Japan on April 4, 2020. A trademark for the English adaptation was filed on June 1st, 2020. It was succeeded by  Yu-Gi-Oh! GO RUSH!! .
 As with all  Yu-Gi-Oh!  spin-offs,  Yu-Gi-Oh! SEVENS  introduces a new protagonist,  Yuga Ohdo  and a new mechanic called  Rush Duel , which uses a simpler version of a traditional Yu-Gi-Oh! card as its counterpart. Like the previous 4 spin-offs ( 5Ds ,  ZEXAL ,  ARC-V   and  VRAINS ), the series introduces a new type of summoning called  Maximum Summon  later on in the first season.
 By the second season,  SEVENS  introduces the gameplay of the  Extra Deck  starting with a new version of the  Fusion Summoning  from the traditional rules while introducing new  types  such as  Cyborg  and  Magical Knight .

 Plot 
 In the not-so-distant future, Goha City is governed by its largest corporation, "Goha Corp", everything from schooling, to Dueling rules, to much of daily life. The Megacorp, Goha Corp, runs the metropolis called "Goha City". Goha Corp doesn't just control Dueling, they also have a major say in the daily necessities of its city’s citizens, such as food, clothing and even shelter.
 Yu-Gi-Oh! SEVENS follows Yuga Ohdo, who attends Goha Seventh Elementary, decides to change this world which is too cramped for kids, and battles with his road "Rush Duel" while believing in his creations. 
 
 Story

 Yuga Ohdo , a 5th grader at  Goha 7th Elementary , spends his time inventing inventions he calls "Roads". Having fed up with the stifling dueling rules by the adults, Yuga decided to create new rules on his own that let duelists go all-out in a Duel from the very start. This proves to be difficult for Yuga to install the new data into the rule servers from his  Duel Disk , because the maker,  Goha Corporation  regulates a penalty mark every time a disk dictates unauthorized access with a time limit to cease action. Getting 6 penalties means a permanent block to the duelist account, and Yuga has already accumulated five.
 But then one day,  Luke , the self proclaimed "#1 Duelist of Goha 7th Elementary", stops Yuga on the way to  his lab , and tells him about the urban rumor of the " King of Duels ". What awaited the curious boys when they arrived at a major monument was  a mysterious person !
 "Try, if you dare... And see if you are worthy of being a King of Duels..." 
 If those new rules can be installed, Yuga could be recognized as a King... ...but only if he defeats his opponent within the time-limit!
 "In that case, I'll Rush Duel, the Road I invented!"  
 Betting on this one last chance, the two young boys, Yuga and Luke, are about to begin their story as they try to change a stuffy, suffocating world with a brand new way of Dueling!!

 Trivia 
 This is the first series to air in the 2020s, the first since the  Toei anime  to be animated by a company other than  Studio Gallop  (in this case, Bridge).
 It is also the first spin-off series since  GX  not to introduce a new Extra Deck Summon method ( Maximum Summoning , which is performed from the hand, was introduced in  episode 23 ). 
 This series is far more comedic and lighthearted than the previous series,  VRAINS . 
 The series' name is a literal word referencing to number 7, making the 7th Yu-Gi-Oh! series in the franchise (with the Toei's Yu-Gi-Oh! anime will be counted, the series will be 8th in the franchise). 
 With 92 episodes for two years, this makes it the shortest Yu-Gi-Oh! spin-off series to date.
