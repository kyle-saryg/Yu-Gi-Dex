 Codename instead of unnamed 
 The currently-unnamed sixth Yu-Gi-Oh! anime series would it be better if you called Yu-Gi-Oh! 6 is the current codename for The upcoming Yu-Gi-Oh! 6th anime. ( Lionel Head  ( talk  •  contribs ) 06:48, December 18, 2016 (UTC))
 
 Theory of the name VRAINS 
 I think VR is short for Virtual Reality . Maybe other letters A , I , N , S are acronyms for something too .
 And from some mangas , I learned that originally , the Japanese Alphabet doesnt have the letter "V" . So to pronounce english words that have "V" , sometimes , Japanese use "B" instead .
 en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%E3%83%B4 : This is a relatively recent addition to kana usage to represent the non-native sound "Vu" . As such, this is only found in borrowed words. Many speakers, especially older people, may pronounce this more as "Bu" .
 In short : VRAINS = BRAINS .

 I'm baffled by why people have a hard time figuring this out.  Sanokal K-T  ( talk  •  contribs ) 20:23, February 17, 2017 (UTC) 
 Official English dub poster?

 When will the English Dub premiere in the US? When it premiere, which network will the English Dub premiere on?  Wikimaster Y  ( talk  •  contribs ) 07:27, November 8, 2020 (UTC)
 
 Still none. Dub is only in Canada and Australia right now.  Pitifulheartles  ( talk  •  contribs ) 07:35, November 8, 2020 (UTC) 
 Adult Swim? 
 Do we have a source on this?

 Cliché 
 I think that we should add on the Trivia section that VRAINS is the first series since GX to not feature the cliché where the main protagonist enters a Duel tournament which has a secret porpuse behind in any way (As Yugi and Yusei were blackmailed to enter on their first on-screen tournaments while Yuma and Yuya worked hard to enter to their's) at some point of the first season. As well as (for now) it is the first one to not involve Duel Tournaments. -- Mantor98741  ( talk  •  contribs ) 04:37, August 4, 2018 (UTC)
 
 Pluto TV 
 That spot is for what network it is on. Yu-Gi-Oh! VRAINS exclusively airs on Pluto TV in the USA.  https://www.yugioh.com/news/vrains-pluto   Matty  ( talk  •  contribs ) 03:23, 6 December 2020 (UTC)
 
 Episode list 
 So according to the infobox, only 8 episodes exist, with 7 dubbed. the episode pages themselves are also only showing a few episodes on each list?  Yu-Gi-Oh! VRAINS episode listing (season 1) ,  Yu-Gi-Oh! VRAINS episode listing (season 2) ,  Yu-Gi-Oh! VRAINS episode listing (season 3) . not the only thing effected either -  Yu-Gi-Oh! episode listing (season 1)  this only has a few episodes listed too. this seems to be a wiki wide problem?
