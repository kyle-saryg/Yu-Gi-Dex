 Biography 
 Yu-Gi-Oh! 
 Ushio overheard  Jonouchi  and  Honda  talking about bullying and asked what they were saying. Jonouchi told Ushio to keep out of it, but Honda quickly restrained him and forced a smile saying that it was nothing. Ushio said that picking on people is bad and Honda quickly agreed. After Ushio left, Honda warned Jonouchi how dangerous it was to pick a fight with Ushio. [2] 
 Ushio met Yugi and asked him if Honda and Jonouchi were bullying him. Yugi replied that nothing was happening to him. Ushio explains that victims often defend their attackers. He then assigns himself the position of Yugi's bodyguard and thought to himself that he had found himself a good dupe. [2] 
 
       Ushio shows  Yugi  that he has beaten-up  Jonouchi  and  Honda .     
 The next day at school, Ushio beat-up Jonouchi and Honda and brought Yugi to see them beat-up. Yugi tried to explain that he didn't want this to happen. Ushio continued to attack Jonouchi, but Yugi protested, refusing to let Ushio do this to his friends. Ushio joked about Yugi calling them his friends and imposed a bodyguard fee of ¥200,000. For that price, he also allowed Yugi to hit the two of them all he wants. Yugi looked at him in shock, which Ushio interpreted as Yugi not being satisfied until Jonouchi and Honda were beaten up some more and proceeds to attack them again. Yugi stood in his way refusing to let him hurt the two and asked Ushio to hurt him instead. Ushio insisted that he hates picking on people, but proclaimed that his bullying was a warning, showing him what will happen if he doesn't pay up. Jonouchi was shocked by Yugi standing up for them as Ushio beat Yugi. Ushio then left the three of them, warning Yugi if he doesn't pay, he'll hurt him with a knife. [2] 
 
       Ushio vs  Dark Yugi .     
 That night, Yugi solved the  Millennium Puzzle  and became possessed by  Dark Yugi  for the first time. Dark Yugi called out Ushio to meet him at the school during the night. Dark Yugi brought twice the amount of money Ushio had demanded, but insisted that they play a game,  Money and Knife , to see who got how much. The game involved using Ushio's knife to jab the banknotes while they are on the player's hand. Ushio played and after a few turns got greedy and rather than risk not winning all the money in the game, he tried to attack Dark Yugi with the knife. However Dark Yugi evaded the attack and inflicted the "Greed, Illusion of Avarice"  Penalty Game  on Ushio, making him believe he is being showered in money. [2] 
 The next day at school, people saw Ushio playing in leaves and litter, which he believed to be money. [2]
