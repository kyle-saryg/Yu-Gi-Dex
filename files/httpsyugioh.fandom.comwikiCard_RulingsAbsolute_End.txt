 OCG Rulings 
 Even if you have  activated  " Absolute End " this turn, during the opponent's  Battle Phase , if you activate " Call of the Haunted " and  Special Summon  a new  monster  after the opponent declares a  direct attack , a  replay  occurs. In that case, due to the effect of "Absolute End", the attacking player must either attack directly or cancel the attack. [1] 
 Previously Official Rulings 
   These TCG rulings were issued by  Upper Deck Entertainment  and have since been deemed unofficial by Konami. [2]  They were previously considered official and can still be correct, as long as they follow the official gameplay rules, or unless Konami has issued a ruling that says otherwise. References:  [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] 
 
 When " Absolute End " is  activated  during an  attack , that  attack  becomes a  direct attack . 
 If " Taunt " and " Absolute End " are both  active , the  attack  becomes a  direct attack  to your  Life Points . This is because the  attack   target  is the  monster  selected by " Taunt ", but then " Absolute End " turns it into a  direct attack . 
 Mentions in Other Rulings 
 Feather Shot : You cannot  activate  " Feather Shot " during a turn where " Absolute End " has been  activated . If " Feather Shot " has already  resolved , " Absolute End " cannot be  activated . If " Absolute End " is  chained  to " Feather Shot ", then the selected " Elemental Hero Avian " cannot  attack . 
 Staunch Defender : If " Absolute End " and " Staunch Defender " are both  activated  during the same turn, the last one to  resolve  will be the one that applies.
