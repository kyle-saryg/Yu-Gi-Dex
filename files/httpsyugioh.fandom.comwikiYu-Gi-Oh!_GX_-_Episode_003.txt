 Summary 
   This summary is currently incomplete. 
 In  Dr. Crowler 's class, he quizzed the first year students on game mechanics.  Alexis Rhodes  successfully named all of the  card types  in  Duel Monsters , while  Syrus Truesdale  failed to explain how  Field Spell Cards  work.
 Crowler commented that he wasn't expecting any more from a "drop-out boy". ("Slifer slacker" in the dub.) Syrus felt embarrassed about what he did, but  Jaden Yuki  defended Syrus by reminding Crowler that Jaden defeated him. Crowler was infuriated about what Jaden did. Later during  Lyman Banner 's class, Syrus thanked Jaden for giving him that support.
 Later, Crowler wrote a fake love letter and placed it in what he believed was Jaden's locker, but turned out to be Syrus'. Syrus read the note and believed that Alexis was in love with him. The letter said to meet her behind the girl’s dormitory at midnight.
 Meanwhile, Crowler hid in the bushes behind the dormitory. He planned to take a picture of Jaden trespassing and breaking school rules, so that he would be expelled. (This is because the girls were bathing.)
 Alexis and her roommates  Mindy  and  Jasmine  were in an outdoor bath, discussing male students, though Alexis did not seem interested in the conversation. (In the dub she showed interest in Jaden and swimsuits are added.)
 While outside, Syrus showed up and Crowler was disappointed to find out that his plan backfired. The girls caught Syrus and he explained to Alexis about the letter. It was obvious to her that someone set Syrus up, but she decided to use the situation to her advantage.
 Meanwhile, Jaden received an anonymous e-mail saying to come to the girl’s dorm if he wants to see Syrus again. Jaden came and Alexis challenged him to a Duel. If he lost, Alexis bluffed she'd report them to the chancellor. Jaden agreed and was ready to duel.
 Afterward, Alexis kept up her end of the deal and let the two friends go. Jaden hoped to duel Alexis again sometime, especially since it was such a close duel. It is revealed in Alexis' thoughts that that she would not have reported Jaden to the chancellor even if she did win.
 In the English version, Mindy and Jasmine begin to suspect that Alexis might have a crush on Jaden. This is not present in the Japanese version, where Alexis simply described Jaden by the ambiguous term "interesting".
 
 Featured Duel: Jaden Yuki vs. Alexis Rhodes 
 
 This Duel uses  Yu-Gi-Oh! GX  anime gameplay . Rules and  card effects  may differ from that of the  TCG / OCG . See the individual card articles for more information.     
 Turn 1: Alexis 
 Alexis   draws  " Doble Passe ". Alexis'  hand  contains " Raregold Armor ", " Polymerization ", " Fusion Gate ", " Mind on Air " and " Etoile Cyber ". She  Normal Summons  " Etoile Cyber " (1200/1600) in  Attack Position  and  Sets  a card.
 Turn 2: Jaden 
 Jaden  draws " Elemental HERO Sparkman " and subsequently Normal Summons it (1600/1400) in Attack Position. "Sparkman"  attacks  "Etoile Cyber", but Alexis  activates  her  face-down  "Doble Passe" to make the attack a  direct attack  (Alexis: 4000 → 2400 LP) and allow "Etoile Cyber" to attack directly afterwards. "Etoile Cyber" then attacks directly. Due to the  effect  of "Etoile Cyber", it gains 600  ATK  ("Etoile Cyber": 1200 → 1800 ATK) before the attack hits (Jaden: 4000 → 2200 LP). Jaden's hand is shown to contain "Polymerization".
 Turn 3: Alexis 
Alexis draws " Blade Skater " and subsequently Normal Summons it (1400/1500) in Attack Position. She then activates "Polymerization" to  fuse  "Etoile Cyber" and "Blade Skater" to  Fusion Summon  " Cyber Blader " (2100/800) in Attack Position. "Cyber Blader" attacks and  destroys  "Sparkman" (Jaden: 2200 → 1700 LP).
 Turn 4: Jaden 
Jaden draws " Fusion Gate " and subsequently activates it. Now both players can perform Fusion Summons without "Polymerization" by  removing  the Fusion Material  monsters  from play instead of  sending  them to the  Graveyard . Jaden uses the effect of "Fusion Gate" to fuse " Elemental HERO Avian " and " Elemental HERO Burstinatrix " to Fusion Summon " Elemental HERO Flame Wingman " (2100/1200) in Attack Position. 
 Jaden then activates " Kishido Spirit ", which will prevent his monsters from being  destroyed by battle  when they  battle  a monster with equal ATK. "Flame Wingman" attacks "Cyber Blader", but the attack ends in a stalemate as "Cyber Blader" can't be destroyed by battle while Jaden controls one monster.
 Turn 5: Alexis 
Alexis draws " Fusion Weapon " and subsequently activates it,  equipping  it to "Cyber Blader" and increasing its ATK and  DEF  by 1500 ("Cyber Blader": 2100 → 3600/800 → 2300). "Cyber Blader" attacks and destroys "Flame Wingman" (Jaden: 1700 → 200 LP).
 Turn 6: Jaden 
Jaden draws " Monster Reborn ". He Normal Summons " Elemental HERO Clayman " (800/2000) in Attack Position. Jaden then activates "Monster Reborn" to revive "Sparkman" (1600/1400) in Attack Position. Jaden uses the effect of "Fusion Gate" to fuse "Sparkman" and "Clayman" to Fusion Summon " Elemental HERO Thunder Giant " (2400/1500) in Attack Position. Since "Thunder Giant" was Fusion Summoned, its effect activates, allowing Jaden to destroy "Cyber Blader" (as its original ATK was less than the ATK of "Thunder Giant"). "Thunder Giant" attacks  directly  (Alexis: 2400 → 0 LP).
 
 Differences in adaptations 
 When Jaden got up after receiving the direct attack made by " Etoile Cyber ", "Polymerization" can be seen in his hand. In the dub, that was replaced with "Elemental HERO Clayman". 
 The scene where Syrus made note of what Field Spells do after Jaden summoned "Thunder Giant" is removed from the dub. 
 In the original, the shockwave made due to the summoning of "Thunder Giant" created waves that splashed against Jaden and Syrus. This scene was removed from the dub. 
 Alexis, Jasmine and Mindy were talking about chest sizes in the original, while in the dub Alexis mentioned something about 'Tackle Marco-Polo'. 
 There are edited on swimsuits in the Dub during the scene where Alexis, Jasmine and Mindy are in the bath. It is noticeably missing when the two went to get Syrus. 
 Mistakes 
       The card color mistake.     
 In the dub, " Elemental HERO Sparkman " is shown as an  Effect Monster  instead of a  Normal Monster .
