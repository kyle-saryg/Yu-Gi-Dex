 Appearance 
       Shadow's full appearance.     
 Little can be ascertained of Shadow's true appearance, though he appears to be a particularly tall man. His outfit consists of a long black coat with metal studs and other ornamentation and metal greaves, as well as gloves, which together cover almost his entire body. Like Yagumo's other henchmen  Hishakaku  and  Eviluder , his face cannot be completely seen, but while the latter two wore masks only covering their mouths, Shadow swaddles his entire face in a large headdress, leaving only his eyes visible.
 
 Abilities 
       Shadow approaches  Kotori  in the form of a shadow.     
 Shadow is able to take the form of a shadow, which he used to spy on and capture  Kotori . He also can make moving shadow items, such as a bird, which he used to send  Kaito  an invitation. Finally, he has shown the ability of disappearing instantly, which he did right after losing to Kaito and  Shark , only leaving  two   cards  behind for them.
 
 Biography 
 After  Hishakaku 's defeat, Shadow was dispatched by  Kyoji Yagumo  to deal with both  Kaito Tenjo  and  Ryoga Kamishiro  by allowing both Numbers Hunters to defeat him, allow each of them to take a Number from him, and then pit the two against one another. [1] 
 
 Number Hunting 
 Shadow had collected at least two " Numbers " besides his " No. 48: Shadow Lich ", which he purposely lost to other Duelists in order to trap them -  " No. 13: Cain's Doom " and " No. 31: Abel's Doom ". His cards were eventually absorbed by  Astral  upon his loss to  Yuma Tsukumo .
 
 Deck 
 Shadow calls his Deck a  Shadow Deck , which uses defensive strategies while  burning  the opponent.
