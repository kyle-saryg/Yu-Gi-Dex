 Belowski , known in Japan as  Mokeo Motegi  (茂木もけ夫,  Motegi Mokeo ) is an  Obelisk Blue  student and the former top student of  Duel Academy  who has the power to communicate with  Duel Monsters . Belowski is a laid-back, carefree, peace-loving boy who isn't afraid to take a nap at the most precarious of times.
 Those in his presence gradually fall asleep without proper precautions and therefore he is confined to his own personal dorm, "a secluded paradise within the depths of the school" as  Dr. Crowler  calls it. [1] 
 Because of his unusual talent in making those around him woozy, Crowler sets up a  Duel  between Belowski and  Jaden Yuki  in the hope that Belowski's power might affect Jaden long enough for him to lose the Duel, thus expelling him from the academy. However, Jaden's excitement and passion for Dueling overwhelms Belowski's power and he ends up winning anyway, after which Belowski dozes off.
 Belowski returns during the second year as one of the few Obelisk Blue students left untouched by the  Society of Light  and participates in a Duel of the  Genex Tournament  against  professional  duelist  Elroy Prescot , who becomes so tired from the boy's special ability that he forfeits the match. He is last seen rejecting Crowler and  Vice-Chancellor Bonaparte 's offer to become a representative of the school and choosing to take a nap under the shady trees instead. [2] 
 Belowski, along with  Chumley , is shown during  Honest 's flashback of  Professor Banner 's class in  episode 176 . [3] 
 He made a cameo in  episode 179 , watching  Jaden 's Graduation Ceremony. [4]

 Voices/Mannerisms 
 His character in the dub, as well as the title of his debut episode, are based on the film,  The Big Lebowski . He speaks like a 1970's rebelling hippy, using terms such as "The Man" and "The Establishment". His Japanese given name is a pun off the name of his key card, " Mokey Mokey ". In the japanese version he ends the majority of his sentences with "ok?".
 
 Decks 
 Past 
 Belowski originally played a  Dragon  Deck , before strange things began to occur to his opponents.
 
 
 Deck Monsters   
 Effect Monsters 
 Diamond Head Dragon Extra Deck   
 Fusion Monsters 
 Kaiser Dragon 
 Mokey Mokey 
 In the present, Belowski plays a  Mokey Mokey  Deck , filled with low- Level   monsters . His main strategy is to  destroy  his own  Fairy - Type  monsters, thus  activating  the  effect  of " Mokey Mokey Smackdown " and increasing the  ATK  of " Mokey Mokey " to 3000.
 By combining this with " Human-Wave Tactics ", Belowski is able to keep up a supply of  monsters  as fodder to trigger the effect of "Smackdown" at the  cost  of his own  Life Points , but he can easily bypass this disadvantage with Life Point-increasing cards such as " Gift of the Mystical Elf " and " Mystic Wok ".
