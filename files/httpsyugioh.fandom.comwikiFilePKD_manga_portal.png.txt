 Biography 
 Duelist Kingdom 
       PaniK suffering a Mind Crush.     
 Because of his brutality, and the apparent frequency with which he knocks Duelists out of the tournament, he wears 2 double-sized  Dueling Gauntlets . 
 PaniK forced  Mai Valentine  to wager all eight of her  Star Chips  in their Duel despite the fact that she only needed to wager two to achieve the ten required.  Yugi Muto  and his friends arrived just after PaniK defeated Mai.
 In order to salvage the situation and return Mai's Star Chips,  Yami Yugi  challenged PaniK to a  Duel . Although PaniK's use of " Castle of Dark Illusions " and the night field both gave his monsters a powerful advantage, Yugi managed to flush out his monsters with " Swords of Revealing Light ", forcing PaniK to use " Chaos Shield " for further defense. As a result, Yugi took advantage of this by destroying the Castle's floatation ring with the effect of " Catapult Turtle ". When the effect of " Swords of Revealing Light " expired, the castle fell on top of PaniK's monsters that were unable to escape the confines of "Chaos Shield", destroying them. 
 With this costing him the Duel, PaniK activated the arena's flame ejectors in an attempt to incinerate Yami Yugi. However, Yami Yugi was protected by the power of the  Millennium Puzzle  and inflicted a  Mind Crush  on PaniK, presumably exorcising the evil within him. (In the English anime, it is implied that either PaniK's soul or the evil within his soul is sent to the  Shadow Realm .)
 
 Waking the Dragons 
         PaniK's lost soul.     
 PaniK also appeared as one of the lost souls wandering the  Stone Wilderness , when  Yami Yugi  ventured through to find Yugi. [1] 
 
 
 Other appearances 
 Player Killer of Darkness (manga) Panik ( Dungeon Dice Monsters ) 
 Deck 
 Anime 
 Panik plays a  Dark Attribute Fiend Deck . Using " Castle of Dark Illusions " he conceals his  monsters  within a  field  of shadows, protecting against  attacks  since his opponents cannot see his cards and thus cannot know how powerful they are; the  Night  also provides his monsters with a  Field Power Bonus , while covering other terrains, preventing his opponents from gaining the same advantages.
 His monsters are mostly level 5  Fiend - Types  with unusual  ATK  and  DEF  values, ending in 10, 30, 80, etc, while most monsters have values that end in 00 or 50. This is so that their ATK and DEF become close to their manga ATK and DEF after they gain the Field Power Bonus from the night.  e.g. "Castle of Dark Illusions" had 1200 ATK and 2500 DEF in the manga. In the anime it had 920 ATK and 1930 DEF, which rose to 1196 and 2509 after the Field Power Bonus. In the manga, it did not gain a Field Power Bonus.
 When his monsters are revealed by " Swords of Revealing Light ", Panik switches to a defensive strategy, bolstering his monsters' DEF with " Chaos Shield ". Yami Yugi claims Panik's method of Dueling is the way of a coward, only powerful when he strikes from the shadows and cowering when confronted in the open, with Yugi's counter-strategy using Panik's reliance on defense against him by putting him in a position where his defenses trap and destroy his own monsters.
