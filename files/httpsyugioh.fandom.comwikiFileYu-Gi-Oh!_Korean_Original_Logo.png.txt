 Wikipedia  has an article about  Yu-Gi-Oh! Trading Card Game . 
 
 
 Yu-Gi-Oh! Official Card Game  (abbreviated as " OCG ") is the version of the Yu-Gi-Oh! card game manufactured by Konami. It is played mainly in Japan, South Korea, and other parts of Asia including China mainland, Hong Kong, Taiwan, Philippines, Malaysia, Singapore and Thailand.
 OCG cards are printed exclusively in Japanese (JP), Korean (KR) and Simplified Chinese (SC) now. It has previously been printed in English (referred to as  Asian-English ) as well as in Traditional Chinese (TC); despite being part of the  OCG , Asian-English cards have " Yu-Gi-Oh! Trading Card Game " printed on their backings, though with a different logo. 
 In the past there have been three different Traditional Chinese prints of cards, including two " Blue-Eyes White Dragon "s and one " Dark Magician ", though they were only for promotional purposes.
 Starting from  Duel Starter Deck  and onward, the  OCG  has started to be officially printed and distributed in Traditional Chinese. [1] However, the Traditional Chinese version has already been cancelled due to inferior quality. Starting from  Starter Deck 2020  and  Structure Deck: The Blue-Eyed Dragon's Thundering Descent,  the OCG has started to be officially printed and distributed in Simplified Chinese. 
 Additionally, starting from  Duelist Alliance , Japanese cards distributed outside Japan are known " Japanese-Asian " (JA) cards.
 Even though they are part of the  OCG , Korean and Asian-English cards follow the  TCG   layout  and artworks. 
 TCG  cards are  not  legal in  OCG  tournaments. Due to OCG cards having different  backings , if a player chooses to use a mixture, they must use protective sleeves that cover the back of the cards.
 OCG  tournaments are divided into three classes: Expert, which has no age restriction, Regular: for high school students and Challenge, for secondary school students.
 Korean cards are only printed in South Korea, and distributed by  Daewon Media . Asian-English, Japanese-Asian are distributed in other parts of Asia by Konami of Hong Kong. Simplified Chinese are distributed in China mainland by Windo Entertainment.
 The age range difference between the OCG and TCG is that the OCG is stated to be for ages 12 and up as mentioned on the back of every booster pack, starter deck, structure deck and tin, implying the game mainly targets early teen players. Opposed from the TCG stating for ages 6 and up.
 As of  September 2013 , the  OCG  and  TCG  have had different  banlists , with multiple cards in fact being  Forbidden  in one list but  Unlimited  in the other (in both directions).

 Notes 
 
 ↑  1.0   1.1   Currently, the Japanese and Korean  OCG  is reusing their respective first logos, as with while the  Yu-Gi-Oh! GX  anime and manga was running. The new  Yu-Gi-Oh! VRAINS  logo is now only used for the anime and the manga, unlike the 2nd, 3rd and 4th logos below.
