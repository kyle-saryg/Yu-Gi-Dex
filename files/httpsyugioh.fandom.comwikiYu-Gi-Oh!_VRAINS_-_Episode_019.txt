 Featured Duel: Playmaker vs Akira Zaizen 
 Duel continues from the previous episode . 
 Turn 4: Playmaker 
The effect of " Tindangle Hound " decreases the  ATK  of each monster Playmaker controls by 1000 for each monster  linked  to them (" Firewall Dragon ": 2500 → 1500 ATK). As he controls a monster that is  Link -4 or more, Playmaker activates the  Spell Card  " Link Hole " to destroy monsters Akira controls, up to the number of monsters he controls that are Link-3 or more. Playmaker destroys "Hound" and the face-down " Tindangle Angel " (" Decode Talker ": 1800 → 2800 ATK; "Firewall Dragon": 1500 → 2500 ATK). As Akira controls no monsters, " Lemoine Point " is destroyed by its own effect.
 "Decode Talker"  attacks  Akira  directly  (Akira: 3900 → 1100  LP ). As Akira took battle damage from Playmaker's monster while he had 3 or more " Tindangle " monsters in his  GY , he activates the  Trap Card  " Tindangle Delaunay " to destroy the attacking monster and  Special Summon  "Tindangle Acute Cerberus" from his  Extra Deck . "Decode Talker" is destroyed and Akira Special Summons " Tindangle Acute Cerberus " (0/LINK-3/↙↑↘) to the  Extra Monster Zone . "Acute Cerberus" gains 1500 ATK for each "Hound" and "Angel" in his GY ("Acute Cerberus": 0 → 3000 ATK). Playmaker  Sets  a card.
 Turn 5: Akira 
"Acute Cerberus" attacks "Firewall Dragon", but Playmaker activates his face-down Trap Card " Doppler Phase Coating ",  equipping  it to a Cyberse monster it controls and preventing it from being destroyed by battle once per turn. He equips it to "Firewall Dragon" (Playmaker: 2000 → 1500 LP). As "Acute Cerberus" attacked, Akira activates its effect to Special Summon a " Tindangle Token " (0/0) to the bottom-right Link Point of "Acute Cerberus". "Acute Cerberus" gains 500 ATK for each "Tindangle" monster it  points to  ("Acute Cerberus": 3000 → 3500 ATK). Akira Sets two cards.
 Turn 6: Playmaker 
Akira activates his face-down Trap Card " Gergonne's End " equipping it to a "Tindangle"  Link Monster  and preventing it from being destroyed by battle or card effects and being  targeted  by card effects. If all of the equipped monster's Link Points are occupied, Akira can send "Gergone's End" and all monsters that the equipped monster points to to the GY and inflict damage to Playmaker equal to the ATK of the equipped monster. He equips it to "Acute Cerberus". Playmaker activates the Spell Card " Alert Lancer " causing all  Cyberse  monsters on the field to deal  piercing   battle damage .
 "Firewall Dragon" attacks the "Tindangle Token", but Akira activates his face-down Continuous Trap Card " Morley's Shield " as a "Tindangle" monster in the  Main Monster Zone  is battling, which reduces the damage Akira takes from that battle to 0. The attack continues and the "Tindangle Token" is destroyed ("Acute Cerberus": 3500 → 3000 ATK).
 Turn 7: Akira 
Akira draws the  Continuous Spell Card  " Nagel's Protection " and subsequently activates it, preventing "Tindangle" monsters from being destroyed by battle or Playmaker's card effects and doubling the first instance of battle damage a "Tindangle" monster inflicts battle damage to Playmaker once per turn.
 "Acute Cerberus" attacks "Firewall Dragon", with the effect of "Doppler Phase Coating" preventing the destruction of "Firewall Dragon", and the effect of "Nagel's Protection" doubling the battle damage dealt (Playmaker: 1500 → 500 LP). Akira activates the effect of "Acute Cerberus", Special Summoning a "Tindangle Token" (0/0) to the bottom-right Link Point of "Acute Cerberus" ("Acute Cerberus": 3000 → 3500 ATK).
 Turn 8: Playmaker 
Playmaker Sets a card.
