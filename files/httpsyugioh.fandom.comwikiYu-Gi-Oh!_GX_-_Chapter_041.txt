 The End of the Battle...?! 
 
 "The Shadow Game Speeds Up!! , known as  "The Duel of Darkness Speeds Up!!"  in the Japanese version, is the forty-first chapter of the  Yu-Gi-Oh! GX  manga . It was first printed in Japanese in the  V Jump  magazine and in English in the  Shonen Jump  magazine. Both of which were printed in  volume 6  of the  Yu-Gi-Oh! GX  graphic novels afterwards.
 Jaden  narrowly avoids defeat against in his  Shadow Duel  against  Reggie . He makes a comeback with " Elemental Hero The Shining ", but is distraught to learn that that Reggie cannot revive  Midori  even if she's defeated.
 
 Summary 
 " Elemental Hero Terra Firma " appears in its "Magma" form.  Jaden  reveals that since that the  ATK  of his " Voltic Spear "- equipped  " Elemental Hero Voltic " was 2000, "Terra Firma" gains ATK equal to that number - so it has 4500 ATK. Jaden declares his  attack  with  Earth Magma Slash .  Reggie  is surprised that Jaden would  Tribute  his own  monster , ignore her  Set  cards and attack. She realizes that he's so concerned with  Midori  that he's lost sight of himself as a Duelist. She shouts that Jaden's attack will not work and  activates  her  face-down  " Heaven's Judgment ", which will  destroy  "Terra Firma" by  sending  a monster of an equal  Level  from Reggie's Deck to the  Graveyard . She sends " The Splendid Venus ". Jaden curses as "Terra Firma' disappears in a flash of light followed by an explosion. Reggie thinks that a Duelist who loses himself in rage can be a fragile thing. Jaden is angry with himself, as he ignored her Set card. He also realizes that he should have attacked with "Voltic" and "Terra Firma" separately - if he had, at least one of them would have survived the turn. He tries to calm himself and assess his situation. His  field  is bare. If Reggie Summons a monster with an ATK of 1000 or more, he's finished. He checks his  hand , which contains " Polymerization ", " Defend Hero " and " Responsibility ". Knowing that the last card of those three can help him survive, he Sets it and ends his turn, knowing that his future rides on that card.
 Reggie  draws , knowing that Jaden has regained his composure due to the pinch he's in. She's drawn " Valhalla, Hall of the Fallen ", while her hand contains " Saint Aura " and " Angel Bow ". With no monsters in her hand, she can't finish Jaden off this turn. She wonders if his Set card is a desperate bluff or a game-breaking card. Either way, she decides she'll be attacking. She does so  directly  with " Iofiel ", wondering what Jaden will do. He responds with his face-down "Responsibility", which will destroy the attacking monster as he has a Level 5 or higher " Hero " monster in his Graveyard. "Terra Firma" appears in front of him, destroying "Iofiel" with a punch. Jaden says that even in the Graveyard, "Terra Firma" will fulfill the responsibility he has as a hero. Reggie activates her own face-down card - " Advent of the Goddess ". This will let her  remove  four Fairy-Type monsters in her Graveyard from play when a Fairy attacks. This allows her to Special Summon one Fairy-Type monster from her Graveyard. She removes the two " Divine Spirit Parmals ", " Tiny Angel " and " Zeriel " to bring out "The Splendid Venus" in  Attack Position . Jaden asks what "Venus" is and Reggie responds that it's one of the " Legendary Planets ", just like Jaden's "Terra Firma". A monster Summoned via "Advent of the Goddess" cannot attack the turn its Summoned, so Reggie Sets a card to end her turn.
 Jaden thinks that the situation has gotten worse. His draw will decide his own fate as well as Midori's. However, he'll never give up - he believes in his cards. He draws " Elemental Hero Flash ". If its sent to the Graveyard, he can add a  Spell  or  Trap Card  in his Graveyard to his hand. He needs Spell from his Graveyard, and remembers that "Heroes" have infinite possibilities. He  Normal Summons  "Flash" in  Defense Position  and ends his turn. Reggie declares that the  effect  of "Venus" will reduce the ATK and  DEF  of "Flash" by 500 each, as it is not a Fairy-Type monster. Reggie believes she'll make Jaden's despair grow. She draws " Mystical Space Typhoon ", disappointed that she still can't seem to draw a monster. She activates her face-down "Saint Aura", changing "Flash" to Attack Position and halving its ATK. The 2800 ATK "Venus" attacks and destroys the 300 ATK Flash" with  Holy Feather Shower , dropping Jaden's  Life Points  from 3000 to 500. The effect of "Flash" activates, so Jaden adds the " Miracle Fusion " in his Graveyard to his hand. Reggie ends her turn, but believes the Duel may be turning in Jaden's favor now - "Miracle Fusion" will let him fuse from the Graveyard. She's angry that she didn't draw a monster. Had she done so, she would have won. Jaden draws and then Normal Summons " Elemental Hero Stratos ". He then uses "Miracle Fusion" to remove the "Flash" and "Voltic" in his Graveyard from play and  Fusion Summon  " Elemental Hero The Shining " in Attack Position. Reggie says that even if it has 2600 ATK, it's no match for "Venus", as the effect of the latter card decreases the ATK of "The Shining" by 500. Jaden reveals that the effect of "The Shining" gives it 300 ATK for each removed from play "Hero". He has four - "Flash", "Voltic", " Woodsman " and " Ocean ". Therefore, the ATK of "The Shining" is 3300.
 Jaden attacks, destroying "Venus" and dropping Reggie's Life Points to 3500 with  Optical Stream . He then attacks directly with "Stratos", leaving Reggie with 1700 Life Points. Parts of her begin to disappear due to the  Shadow Duel . Jaden Sets a card to end his turn, telling Reggie that he'll defeat her and save Midori. Reggie asks how Jaden intends to save her, with him responding that Reggie must know. Reggie recalls Midori saying the same of  Koyo . She says that all anyone talks about is saving, and tells Jaden she has no idea how to wake Midori up. She asks if that's all Jaden wanted to know, and says that they'll now reconvene the Shadow Duel.
 
 Featured Duel: Jaden Yuki vs. Reggie MacKenzie 
 Duel continues from  previous chapter . 
 Turn 5: Jaden 
 Jaden  has just  attacked   Reggie 's " Iofiel " with his 4500- ATK  " Elemental Hero Terra Firma ". Reggie  activates  her  face-down  " Heaven's Judgment ",  sending  the  Level  8 " The Splendid Venus " from her  Deck  to the  Graveyard  to  destroy  "Terra Firma". Jaden's  hand  contains " Polymerization ", " Defend Hero " and " Responsibility . He  Sets  a card ("Responsibility").
 Turn 6: Reggie 
Reggie  draws  " Valhalla, Hall of the Fallen ", while her hand contains " Angel Bow " and " Saint Aura ". Reggie attacks  directly  with " Iofiel ", but Jaden activates his face-down "Responsibility", destroying "Iofiel" as the Level 8 "Terra Firma" is in the Graveyard. Reggie activates her face-down " Advent of the Goddess ",  removing  the two " Divine Spirit Parmals ", " Tiny Angel ", and " Zeriel " in her Graveyard from play to  Special Summon  "The Splendid Venus" (2800/2400) from her Graveyard in  Attack Position , but it may not attack this  turn . Reggie Sets a card.
 Turn 7: Jaden 
Jaden draws " Elemental Hero Flash ", which he  Normal Summons  (1100/1600) in  Defense Position . The  effect  of "Venus" decreases its ATK and  DEF  by 500 ("Flash": 1100 → 600/1600 → 1100).
 Turn 8: Reggie 
Reggie draws " Mystical Space Typhoon ". She activates her face-down "Saint Aura", switching "Flash" to Attack Position" and halving its ATK ("Flash": 600 → 300/1100). "Venus" attacks and destroys "Flash" (Jaden 3000 → 500). The effect of "Flash" activates, letting Jaden add " Miracle Fusion " from his Graveyard to his hand.
 Turn 9: Jaden 
Jaden draws " Elemental Hero Stratos " and subsequently Normal Summons it (1800/300) in Attack Position. He then activates "Miracle Fusion", removing the "Elemental Hero Flash" and " Elemental Hero Voltic " in his Graveyard from play to  Fusion Summon  " Elemental Hero The Shining " (2600/2100) in Attack Position. The effect of "Venus" decreases its ATK by 500 ("The Shining": 2600 → 2100/2100 → 1600) but its own effect increases its ATK by 300 for each of Jaden's removed from play "Elemental Heroes". There are currently four Elemental Heroes removed from play ("Voltic", "Flash", " Woodsman " and " Ocean ") ("The Shining": 2100 → 3300/1600). "The Shining" attacks and destroys "Venus" (Reggie 4000 → 3500) ("Stratos": 1300 → 1800/300). "Stratos" attacks directly (Reggie 3500 → 1700). Jaden Sets a card.
