This article is about the world which is named after  Darkness . For the world associated with  Millennium Items  and  Shadow Charms  that is also called the "World of Darkness" in the Japanese version, see  Shadow Realm .      
       World of Darkness     
 The  World of Darkness  (ダークネスの世界  Dakunesu no Sekai ) is a realm that exists between the  alternate dimensions of Duel Spirits . In the World of Darkness, humans are tortured constantly by being forced to live visions of their dreams being crushed, until they give up on their individuality. Whoever is sent there is erased from the memory of others.
 Yusuke Fujiwara  attempted to summon  Nightshroud  in the  Abandoned Dorm . This opened a portal to the World of Darkness, pulling him into it and infecting the dorm with dark powers. [1]  Oddly, this resulted in the dorm gaining the ability to pull people into the  other   World of Darkness . [2] 
 According to Nightshroud, the World of Darkness existed before life on Earth, and is the polar opposite of life, although it is not death. It will exist as long as darkness exists in the hearts of people, causing Nightshroud to manifest once again in the real world. [3] 
 
       Students trapped inside the World of Darkness     
 People are brought into the World of Darkness when they succumb to the darkness in their hearts, which takes on replete forms. For example,  Tyranno Hassleberry  would assume the life of the dinosaur whose bone is in his leg which was that of a predator. He would then fall prey and be agonized by the dinosaurs he loves. On the other hand,  Syrus Truesdale  would have to Duel to gain his brother  Zane 's happiness until the day Zane dies.
 During the fourth season of  Yu-Gi-Oh! GX   Trueman  and  Nightshroud  pull several people, including  Sartorius ,  Sarina ,  Axel Brodie , Tyranno Hassleberry,  Taigo Sorano , the many residents of  Domino City , all the students at  Duel Academy  (save  Jaden Yuki ) and eventually the whole world, into the World of Darkness. However, Jaden is able to get all of the victims to focus on their dearest memories and the bonds with their cards, allowing them to escape. After Jaden defeats Nightshroud, the latter and the World of Darkness are both destroyed.
