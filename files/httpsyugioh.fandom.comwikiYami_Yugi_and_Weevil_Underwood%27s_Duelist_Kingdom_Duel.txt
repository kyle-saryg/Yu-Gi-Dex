 Prior Events 
 Yugi Muto  and his friends,  Joey Wheeler ,  Tristan Taylor  and  Téa Gardner , all get off the boat after landing at Duelist Kingdom, an island to host a big Duel Monsters tournament organized by  Maximillion Pegasus , who kidnapped the soul of Yugi's Grandfather. At first Tristan freaks out due to the fact he and Téa snuck on board the boat, until she reminds him that they are in the middle of nowhere. As Tristan skirts by one of the members of security informs him that he and Téa will be treated as Yugi's and Joey's plus ones for the duration of the tournament. Once the tournament begins Pegasus explains the rules, saying that duelists can challenge anyone at any time and wager their  Star Chips . Duelists with 10 Star Chips are then gained access to Pegasus's Castle where whoever makes it will battle for the right to duel Pegasus in the final match.
 After the opening ceremony, Yugi and his friends decide to find Weevil Underwood, who threw Yugi's  Exodia  cards overboard. They find him but he revealed he lured them into a trap. Yugi accepted Weevil's challenge wagering his only Star Chip and his deck against Weevil's 2 star chips.
 
 The Duel 
 Featured Duel: Yami Yugi vs. Weevil Underwood 
 
 This Duel uses  Duelist Kingdom  gameplay. Rules and  card effects  may differ from that of the  TCG / OCG . See the individual card articles for more information.     
 Monsters  compatible with  Forest  or  Desert  receive a 30%  Field Power Bonus . This includes  Beast ,  Beast-Warrior ,  Dinosaur ,  Insect ,  Plant ,  Rock  and  Zombie - Type  monsters.
 Turn 1: Weevil 
Weevil  draws . He then  Normal Summons  " Killer Needle " ( 1200  → 1560/ 1000  → 1300) in  Attack Position .
 Turn 2: Yami Yugi 
Yugi draws. He then Normal Summons " Mammoth Graveyard " ( 1200  → 1560/ 800  → 1040) in Attack Position. "Mammoth Graveyard"  attacks  "Killer Needle". At first "Killer Needle" seems to have destroyed "Mammoth Graveyard" since Killer Needle gets a  Field Power Bonus  from the  Forest  area, but Weevil doesn't notice that "Mammoth Graveyard" also obtained a Field Power Bonus from the  Wasteland  area, thus  destroying  both monsters in a  Double KO .
 Turn 3: Weevil 
Weevil draws. He then Normal Summons " Hercules Beetle " ( 1500  → 1950/ 2000  → 2600) in Attack Position.
 Turn 4: Yami Yugi 
Yugi draws. He then Normal Summons " Feral Imp " ( 1300 / 1400 ) in Attack Position. Yugi then  activates  " Horn of the Unicorn ", equipping it to "Feral Imp" and increasing its  ATK  and  DEF  by 700 ("Feral Imp": 1300 → 2000/1400 → 2100). "Feral Imp" attacks "Hercules Beetle". Because "Hercules Beetle" has a Field Power Bonus and it is battling a monster that has an Equip Card, the effects of "Horn of the Unicorn" are negated ("Feral Imp": 2000 → 1300/2100 → 1400). "Hercules Beetle" destroys "Feral Imp" (Yugi: 2000 → 1350  LP ).
 Turn 5: Weevil 
Weevil passes.
 Turn 6: Yami Yugi 
Yugi draws. He then  Sets  a monster.
 Turn 7: Weevil 
Weevil draws. He then Normal Summons " Basic Insect " ( 500  → 650/ 700  → 910) in Attack Position. Weevil then activates " Level 3 Laser Cannon ", equipping it to "Basic Insect" and increasing its ATK and DEF by 300 ("Basic Insect": 650 → 950/910 → 1210). He then activates " Lev. 2 Power Boost ", equipping it to "Basic Insect" and increasing its ATK by 1200 and its DEF by 200 ("Basic Insect": 950 → 2150/1210 → 1410). "Basic Insect" attacks and destroys Yugi's Set "[[Griffore (manga)|]]" ( ???  →  Expression error: Unrecognized punctuation character "?". / ???  →  Expression error: Unrecognized punctuation character "?". ).

 Turn 16: Yami Yugi 
Yugi draws " Dark Magician " and subsequently Sets it.
 Turn 17: Weevil 
Weevil draws. "Basic Insect" attacks Yugi's Set "Dark Magician" ( 2500 / 2100 ). Yugi then activates his face-down " Mirror Force " to destroy every monster on Weevil's side of the field and inflict damage to him equal to the difference between the ATK of "Basic Insect" and the ATK of all other monsters destroyed by this effect (Weevil: 2000 → 555 LP).
 Yugi  has 1350 LP remaining and controls "Dark Magician" ( 2500 / 2100 ) in  Attack Position , "[[Torike (manga)|]]" ( ??? / ??? )  Set  and no other Set cards.
 Turn 17: Weevil 
 Weevil  Sets " Larvae Moth ".
 Turn 18: Yami Yugi 
Yugi  activates  " Monster Recovery " to return to his  hand  and all  monsters  he  controls  ("Dark Magician" and "Torike") to his  Deck  and  draw  five cards. The last effect of "Monster Recovery" then forces Yugi to  Special Summon  the monster with the lowest  ATK  from the cards he draws. Yugi Special Summons " Kuriboh " ( 300 / 200 ) in  Attack Position  this way, triggering Weevil's face-down " Parasite Worm " to  destroy  "Kuriboh" and inflict  damage  to Yugi equal to its  ATK  (Yugi: 1350 → 1050 LP), though Weevil never intended to activate it.
 Turn 19: Weevil 
Weevil draws. He reveals that the "Parasite Worm" trap was not the real threat. He then  Flip Summons  "Larvae Moth" ( 500  → 650/ 400  → 520) in  Defense Position . He then  equips  "Larvae Moth" with " Cocoon of Evolution ", making its ATK and DEF equal to that of "Cocoon of Evolution" ("Larvae Moth": 650 → 0/520 → 2000 → 2600). Weevil can Special Summon " Great Moth " in two turns.
 Turn 20: Yami Yugi 
Yugi  Normal Summons  "[[Gaia The Fierce Knight (manga)|]]" ( ??? / ??? ) in Attack Position. "Gaia"  attacks  "Larvae Moth". The attack fails (Yugi: 1050 → 750 LP).
 Turn 21: Weevil 
Weevil draws, then passes. Weevil can Special Summon "Great Moth" in one turn.
 Turn 22: Yami Yugi 
Yugi draws " Beaver Warrior " and subsequently Sets it.
 Turn 23: Weevil 
Weevil passes. Weevil can Special Summon "Great Moth" at any time during his turn, or Special Summon " Perfectly Ultimate Great Moth " in two turns.
 Turn 24: Yami Yugi 
Yugi draws, then passes.
 Turn 25: Weevil 
Weevil draws, then passes. Weevil can Special Summon " Perfectly Ultimate Great Moth " in one turn.
 Turn 26: Yami Yugi 
Yugi draws. He then Normal Summons " Curse of Dragon " ( 2000 / 1500 ) in Attack Position. Yugi activates " Burning Land " to destroy the  Field  ("Larvae Moth": 0/2600 → 2000). "Gaia" attacks and destroys "Larvae Moth". Upon its destruction, Weevil Special Summons "Great Moth" ( 2600 / 2500 ) in Attack Position, since "Cocoon of Evolution" had been equipped with "Larvae Moth" for four turns.
 Turn 27: Weevil 
Weevil draws. "Great Moth" attacks "Gaia", but Yugi activates " Polymerization " from his hand to  fuse  "Curse of Dragon" with "Gaia" and  Fusion Summon  " Gaia the Dragon Champion " ( 2600 / 2100 ) in Attack Position. A  replay  occurs, and "Great Moth" attacks and destroys Yugi's Set "Beaver Warrior" ( 1200 / 1500 ). At this point, the poisonous scales of "Great Moth" continually decrease the ATK of "Gaia the Dragon Champion" ("Gaia the Dragon Champion": 2600 → 1900/2300).
 Turn 28: Yami Yugi 
Yugi draws " Makiu, the Magical Mist " and subsequently activates it. The air is dampened, which stops the ATK of "Gaia the Dragon Champion" from decreasing further.
 Turn 29: Weevil 
Weevil draws. "Great Moth" attacks and destroys "Gaia the Dragon Champion" (Yugi: 750 → 50 LP).
 Turn 30: Yami Yugi 
Yugi draws. He then Normal Summons " Summoned Skull " ( 2500 / 1200 ) in Attack Position. Weevil thinks he has the duel won since Summoned Skull was weaker, however, Yugi points out that The effect of "Makiu" is still in play, leaving "Great Moth"  soaked, and since Summoned Skull attacks with electricity, it increases the ATK of "Summoned Skull" by 1000 ("Summoned Skull": 2500 → 3500/1200). "Summoned Skull" attacks and destroys "Great Moth" (Weevil: 555 → 0 LP).
 
 Aftermath 
 Yami Yugi wins Weevil's two star chips, thus eliminating him from the tournament, and Joey takes Weevil's Dueling Gauntlet.
