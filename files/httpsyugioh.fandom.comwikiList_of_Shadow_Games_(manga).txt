However he got anxious, causing his heart to beat, while he was holding his microphone next to it. The sound of his heart was amplified on a speaker beside Sozoji, causing his doll to dance. Dark Yugi inflicted the Beat Festival Penalty Game on Sozoji for losing. [4] 
 
 
 
 
 One finger BATTLE! 
 
 Dark Yugi and the  escaped prisoner  were each allowed to only use one of their ten fingers. The player to die loses. The prisoner chose his right index finger, so he could shoot Dark Yugi with his gun. Dark Yugi chose his left thumb and lit a cigarette lighter with. He was allowed to light the cigarette in the prisoner's hand before being shot. But after doing so, he placed in the lighter on the prisoner's left arm, which was pouring vodka.

 Paper Crash! 
 
 A bottle of chloroform was placed on a number of sheets on the center of a table. Players took turns pulling sheets out from under the bottle, trying not to break the bottle. On one of his turns Dark Yugi managed to cause the the bottle to stop partly over the edge of the table. He said if  Kokurano  really was a psychic, he should be able to make the bottle levitate. Kokurano tried this, but only imagined the bottle floating. He pulled a sheet causing the bottle to smash and got knocked out by the chloroform. [6] 
 
 
 
 
 Griddle Ice Hockey 
 
 Griddle Ice Hockey was an air hockey-like Shadow Game Dark Yugi played against  Goro Inogashira . A giant heated grill and spatulas were used as the field and bats. A test tube of explosive chemicals embedded in a block of ice was used as a puck. Players used their bats to hit the chemicals towards their opponent. If the chemicals touched the hot grill, a player could be injured by the explosion. Goro initially had the upperhand as he dealt powerful blows, but Dark Yugi managed to crack the ice, such that it broke next time Goro hit it, causing the chemicals to explode in front of him. [7] 
 
 
 
 
 Dark Puzzle 
 
 Ms. Chono  put together  Hiroto Honda 's  love jigsaw puzzle  for  Miho Nosaka  in front of the class and threatened to expel the sender. Dark Yugi used the Millennium Puzzle to change the nature of the jigsaw puzzle to a Shadow Game. As Ms. Chono solved the jigsaw, she hurt herself as much as she hurt others. This caused the make-up on her face to peel away like pieces of a jigsaw and revealed her ugly face. [8] 
 
 
 
 
 Coin in sneaker 
 
 A scorpion  and ten coins were placed inside an  Air Muscle  shoe. Each player took turns trying to grab coins without getting stung. For the first few turns, each player got one coin at a time. The  Junky Scorpion owner  then tried killing the scorpion by sticking a knife into the shoe and grabbing all the remaining coins. However he failed to kill the scorpion and by grabbing too many coins, his fist was too big to fit back out of the foot hole. The scorpion then proceeded to sting the owner. [9] 
 
 
 
 
 Duel Monsters ( Dark Yugi and Kaiba )
 
 Dark Yugi and  Seto Kaiba  played a Shadow Game of  Duel Monsters , where the monsters Summoned came to life and the cards were destroyed when the monsters were killed. Kaiba cheated in the Duel, by slipping in the " Blue-Eyes White Dragon " card he had stolen, from his pocket to his  hand . However when he tried attacking "Blue-Eyes" refused to obey as its loyalties lay with  Sugoroku , so it destroyed itself and Dark Yugi resurrected it with " Monster Reborn ". Dark Yugi won and inflicted the Experience of Death Penalty Game on Kaiba. [10] [11] 
 
 
 
 
 Landmine Search Network 
 
 Dark Yugi allowed himself to be beaten around a bit by  Hirutani's gang , while he made a makeshift trap; he positioned  an unconscious gangster's  arm holding a stun gun on a vertical bar over a puddle of water. He tied his Millennium Puzzle to a chain over the gangster's forehead and stood on a tire over the puddle. He warned the gang that there was a time bomb and they would suffer a Penalty Game if they didn't find the switch. The gang initially believed their own stun guns to be the switch, since they were standing in water and covered in water and would shock themselves by switching them on. However water dripped from the Millennium Puzzle to the unconscious member's forehead, causing him to wake up and drop his stun gun in the puddle, shocking the other gangsters. [12] 
 
 
 
 
 Question of Truth 
 
 Shadi  performed the  Weighing of the Heart  on  Curator Kanekura . Shadi placed the  Feather of Ma'at  on one side of the  Millennium Scales  and asked Kanekura a series of questions. If Kanekura told the truth, the side with the feather would lower. If he lied the other would lower. The side of lies hit the table after a few questions and Kanekura suffered a  Penalty Game , which killed him. [13] 
 
 
 
 
 Labyrinth Treasure Hunt 
 
 Shadi searched  Dark Yugi's soul room  to find the true power of the Millennium Puzzle. However Dark Yugi turned the search into a Shadow Game and revealed that his soul room was a maze of stairs and doorways filled with traps. After finding the true soul room, Shadi would see the power he was looking for. However he eventually fell into one of the traps, but was saved by Dark Yugi. [14] 
 
 
 
 
 Trial of the Mind 
 
 Shadi  redecorated   Anzu 's  soul room , turning her into a mindless doll. He stood her on a board suspended over the side of a building by four ropes strung through a fence and tied to four  ushebti . The four ropes were also strung through the  Millennium Key , which was held up by a fifth ushebti. If the first four ushebti broke, the board would lose its support and Anzu would fall to her death. If the fifth ushebti broke first, the Millennium Key would slide along the ropes and touch Anzu's hand, returning her to normal. The four ushebti supporting the board represented Dark Yugi's heart and would break if a weakness in his heart was detected. The other ushebti represented Shadi's heart and would break if a weakness was detected in it. Shadi put Dark Yugi through a number of stages to try and expose weakness in Dark Yugi's heart, but in the end Dark Yugi and his friends showed Shadi the power of unity, which caused Shadi's ushebti to break. [15] 
 
 
 
 
 Hell Quiz 
 
 This riddle was the first stage Shadi used to try to expose a weakness in Dark Yugi's heart. Shadi created the illusion of zombies breaking out of the ground and grabbing onto Dark Yugi. The only way for the illusion to disappear was for Dark Yugi to determine the true nature of the illusion using the riddle "What creeps on the ground and clings to the pillars?". Dark Yugi was the pillar for the clue and the zombies were what clung to him. The answer to the riddle was a shadow, so the zombies were his shadow. [16] 
 
 
 
 
 Concentration or Death 
 
 Concentration or Death was the second stage Shadi used to try to expose a weakness in Dark Yugi's heart. An illusion of  Ammit  appeared out of the ground and grabbed onto Dark Yugi. Although she was an illusion her bite could still kill Dark Yugi. Nine face-down plates appeared before Dark Yugi. The plates represented a mirror and contained four pairs and one extra. Dark Yugi needed to say what the extra plate depicted within five minutes or he would be bitten by Ammit. Since the plates represented a mirror, Dark Yugi realized that the four pairs were four visible parts of Ammit that she had two of; eyes, ears, nostrils and arms and the odd plates was something she had one of; her mouth. [17] 
 
 
 
 
 Game of Death 
 
 The Game of Death was the last stage Shadi used to try to expose a weakness in Dark Yugi's heart. An illusion of  Jonouchi , who had his old bully persona, was created. The Jonouchi illusion took the  Millennium Puzzle  from Dark Yugi and a bottomless pit appeared around them. The players were to take turns tossing the puzzle, which would cause their opponent to move two tiles in the direction it landed pointing, with the intention of making them walk over the edge. This stage succeeded in breaking two ushebti, as  regular Yugi  briefly had a moment of control of his body and wept seeing Jonouchi in his old persona. Dark Yugi refused to take his turns and relied on his trust that his friend wouldn't kill him. This caused the illusion of Jonouchi to stop playing and disappear. [18] 
 
 
 
 
 Maze of Fire 
 
 Dark Yugi sprayed paint along the ground as he got chased by thugs with knives. Meanwhile, a cigarette butt burned away on the ground. Once the thugs cornered Dark Yugi, he directed their attention to the paint and the cigarette, which was being used as a fuse. The flame from the cigarette hit the paint, setting it on fire. The created a "Maze of Fire" separating the thugs from Yugi. With the legs of their trousers on fire, the three thugs ran away and leaped into the nearby canal. [19] 
 
 
 
 
 Capsule Monster Chess ( Dark Yugi VS Mokuba )
 
 Dark Yugi and  Mokuba Kaiba  played a rigged game of  Capsule Monster Chess , where Mokuba got high Level monsters, while Dark Yugi got low Level ones. If Mokuba won, he would cut off one of Yugi's fingers and if Dark Yugi won, Mokuba would receive a Penalty Game. In the game, Dark Yugi sacrificed his monsters to lure Mokuba into lining his up diagonally, allowing " Torigun " to take out Mokuba's last four monsters all at once using its special ability. [20] 
 
 
 
 
 Duel Monsters ( Sugoroku VS Kaiba )
 
 Kaiba faced  Sugoroku "Grandpa" Mutou  in a game of  Duel Monsters .

Kaiba won and used Solid Vision monsters to recreate the "Experience of Death" Penalty Game. [21] 
 
 
 
 
 Capsule Monster Chess ( Dark Yugi VS Mokuba )
 
 In  Death-T , Dark Yugi and Mokuba played a game of  Capsule Monster Chess , enhanced by  Solid Vision , where the loser was to suffer the simulated "Experience of Death" Penalty Game. Dark Yugi made use of his monsters' effects to destroy or backfire the effects of Mokuba's monsters and clearing a path to an evolution square to win the game. Kaiba inflicted the "Experience of Death" Penalty Game on Mokuba, despite being his brother. However he was saved by Dark Yugi. [22] [23] 
 
 
 
 
 Duel Monsters ( Dark Yugi VS Kaiba )
 
 In the final stage of Death-T, Dark Yugi and Kaiba played a game of  Duel Monsters , enhanced by  Solid Vision .

 Red Paint Lottery 
 
 Dark Yugi played a Shadow Game against the  ZTV technician , who on behalf of  the producer  had rigged  The Get the Million Game  for Jonouchi to lose. Dark Yugi and the technician tied their hands to ropes, one of which was tied to an overhead paint bucket. The two of them pulled their ropes at the same time. The paint bucket turned out to be attached to the technician's rope and landed on his head. This made him unable to press the button which rigged Jonouchi's game. The director was also unable to push the button, as the switchboard had been covered in paint, preventing him from distinguishing the necessary button from the others. Dark Yugi inflicted the Mind on Air Penalty Game on the director, causing him to run out on set and demand the viewers to sent him money. [28] 
 
 
 
 
 Monster Fighter ( Dark Yugi VS Nagumo )
 
 Dark Yugi played a Shadow Game of  Monster Fighter  against  Koji Nagumo . The game consisted of three rounds. Dark Yugi won the first round by taking advantage of Nagumo slipping his attention from the game as he attempted to make an outside interference. Nagumo won the second round by cheating, so Dark Yugi upped the level of the Shadow Game from 1 to 3 for the final round. This time Nagumo was unable to cheat as his monsters held him back. His own monster was replaced with a representation of his inner-self. Dark Yugi defeated it and left Nagumo to be eaten by shadows. [29] [30]

 Dragon Cards ( Dark Yugi VS Imori )
 
 After losing in their previous game, Yugi touched off the Millennium Puzzle, allowing Dark Yugi to take control and face Imori in a rematch. Imori again predicted which dragons Dark Yugi was gathering and Summoned  water  and  wood dragons  to counter Dark Yugi's  earth  and  metal dragons . Imori tried making use of how different elements affect each other to win, but Dark Yugi made good use of his dragons abilities and won the game. Imori's soul was sucked into the jar as his Penalty Game and Yugi's soul was freed as the jar only had the capacity for one human soul. [32] 
 
 
 
 
 Dark Bakura VS Karita
