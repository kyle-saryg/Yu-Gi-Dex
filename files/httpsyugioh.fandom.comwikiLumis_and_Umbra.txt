 Lumis  and  Umbra  are tag-team members of  Marik Ishtar 's  Rare Hunter  organization. They pride themselves on being an unbeatable tag team. 
 In the anime, they have receivers attached to their masks, so they can secretly communicate their strategies with one another. This was not shown in the manga.
 
 Biography 
       Lumis and Umbra lineart     
 After Marik's goons successfully capture Joey, Mokuba, and Téa (in the manga, the Mask of Light used a  Duelist Chastity Belt  to lock Kaiba's  Duel Disk , with the key to it being the hostage), both duelists (now wearing their half-masks) challenge Seto Kaiba and Yugi Muto to a  Tag-Team Duel  at the rooftop of a skyscraper. In this duel, the glass panels that they are standing on each have a Shadow Box attached to them. As soon as a player's Life Points drop to 0, the Shadow Box will go off sending the loser falling and trapping them in the  Shadow Realm  before the fall (for the Japanese version, the Shadow Boxes were bombs that would detonate, sending the loser to fall through a 130-foot building to his death).
 Despite the advantages Lumis and Umbra had, after a slip up made by Lumis, and with some provoking from Kaiba, the masked duo's teamwork faltered, which led to their eventual defeat. Seto Kaiba managed to use " Soul Exchange " to summon Obelisk the Tormentor. In spite of their recent bickering the two genuinely still cared for each other as Lumis was concerned for Umbra's life when Kaiba defeated him with Obelisk, sending him down the window pane, fortunately Umbra had a parachute that he used to escape safely. Mournful over Umbra's defeat, Lumis reluctantly surrendered in a mix anger and sorrow. Marik then uses him to communicate with Yugi, presumably rendering him comatose with his Millennium Rod afterwards.
 
 Original Appearance 
       Lumis and Umbra during their first appearance in the anime     
 In the anime, Lumis and Umbra originally appear unmasked as the team that originally tag duels Yugi and Kaiba, this is alluded to in the Japanese version and directly referenced with a flashback in the English dub. In the manga's continuity, these characters ( Rare Hunter 2  and  Rare Hunter 3 ) were separate characters entirely and did not make and further appearances (confirmed in  Yu-Gi-Oh! Character Guidebook: The Gospel of Truth ).
