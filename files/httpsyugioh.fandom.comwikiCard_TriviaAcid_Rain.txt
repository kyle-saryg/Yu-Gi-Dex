 There is an upgraded version of this card, " System Down ".
 This card also has a  Flip Effect Monster  counterpart, " Magnetic Mosquito ." 
 The monster being destroyed appears to be " Cyber Raider ".
 That monster also looks like " Blazing Inpachi " becoming " Charcoal Inpachi ". 
 This card may be a reference to the well known environmental problem of pollution. Acids (compounds that usually included hydrogen and halogens) react explosively with alkali metals and alkali earth metals, but slowly with transition metals (like iron or titanium). 
 This card seems to show a scene shortly after that of " Acidic Downpour ".
