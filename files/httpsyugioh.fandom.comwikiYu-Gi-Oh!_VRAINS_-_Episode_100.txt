 " I Know Everything ", known as " Twisted Utopia " in the Japanese version, is the one-hundredth episode of  Yu-Gi-Oh! VRAINS  anime. It aired in Japan on May 1, 2019. It aired in English on Teletoon on January 3, 2021.
 Bohman  uses the consciousness of the people trapped in  LINK VRAINS  to create a  Data Storm , and summons forth a powerful  Hydradrive  monster.  Playmaker  is completely helpless before Bohman. Seeing this, the three  Knights of Hanoi  decide to take action.
 
 Featured Duel: Playmaker vs. Bohman 
 Duel continues from the previous episode . 
 Turn 2: Playmaker 
Bohman activates the effect of " Chimera Hydradrive Dragrid ", removing the  Hydradrive Counter  from it to roll a die to return "Dragrid" to the Extra Deck and summon a "Draghead" monster, whose Attribute corresponds to the dice roll. He rolls a 2 (WATER), so he returns "Dragrid" to the Extra Deck to  Special Summon  " Chimera Hydradrive Draghead - Aqua " (4000/LINK-5/↙←↖↑↗). The effect of "Draghead - Aqua" activates, negating all other monster effects that are not linked to "Aqua"; the effects of " Cyberse Quantum Dragon " are negated. Playmaker ends his turn. At the end of the turn, the effect of "Draghead - Aqua" allows it to return to Bohman's Extra Deck and Special Summon "Chimera Hydradrive Dragrid" from the Extra Deck. As "Dragrid" was Special Summoned from Extra Deck, its effect places one Hydradrive Counter on itself.
 Turn 3: Bohman 
Bohman activates "Dragrid" effect by removing the Hydradrive Counter and rolls a dice. He rolls a three (FIRE), then returns "Dragrid" to the Extra Deck, and Special Summons " Chimera Hydradrive Draghead - Flame " (4000/LINK-5/↖↑↗→↘). Its effect activates, destroying all monsters that are not linked to "Draghead - Flame". Playmaker activates the effect of " Cyberse Synchron " from his GY, banishing it instead of destroying "Quantum Dragon". Bohman attacks "Quantum Dragon" with "Draghead - Flame" (Playmaker: 4000 → 2500 LP). At the end of his turn, Bohman activates the other effect of "Draghead - Flame", returning it to the Extra Deck and Special Summoning "Dragrid" from the Extra Deck, which places a Hydradrive Counter on itself by its own effect.
 Turn 4: Playmaker 
Playmaker  Normal Summons  " Clock Wyvern " (1800/1000), and activates its effect, halving its ATK ("Clock Wyvern": 1800 → 900 ATK) to Special Summon a " Clock Token " (0/0). He uses "Clock Token" to  Link Summon  " Link Spider " (1000/LINK-1/↓). Playmaker activates the effect of "Link Spider", Special Summoning a Level 4 or below Normal Monster from his hand to the zone "Link Spider" points to. He Special Summons " Protron " (100/100). He then uses "Clock Wyvern and "Link Spider" to Link Summon " Clock Spartoi " (800/LINK-2/↓↘). The effect of "Clock Spartoi" lets Playmaker to add " Cynet Fusion " from his Deck to his hand. He then uses "Protron" to Link Summon " Linkuriboh " (300/LINK-1/↓) below "Clock Spartoi", whose effect activates, allowing Playmaker to Special Summon a Level 4 or below Cyberse monster from his GY to the zone it points to, with its effects negated. He summons "Clock Wyvern". He then plays "Cynet Fusion", fusing "Clock Wyvern", "Linkuriboh" and "Clock Spartoi" to Fusion Summon " Cyberse Clock Dragon " (2500/2000). As "Cyberse Clock Dragon" was Fusion Summoned, Playmaker activates its effect, sending cards from the top of his Deck to the GY, equal to the combined Link Rating of the Link Monsters used to Fusion Summon it, and gains 1000 ATK for each card sent. The combined Link Rating of "Clock Spartoi" and "Linkuriboh" is three, so Playmaker sends the top three cards of his deck to the GY ("Cyberse Clock Dragon": 2500 → 5500 ATK). 
 Duel continues in the next episode .
