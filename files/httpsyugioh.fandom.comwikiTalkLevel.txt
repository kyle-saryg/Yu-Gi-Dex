 Level 9+ 
 Where does the info on 9+ level monsters requiring more than two  Tributes ? Also, all level twelve monsters are  Fusion Monsters , and thus cannot be  Normal Summoned  in the first place! The latest official rulebook I saw only stated that level seven or higher monsters require two Tributes to be Normal Summoned. So can anyone show me a reliable source for the info in this article? Otherwise, it should be changed.  Rainyday2012  18:01, 14 May 2007 (UTC)
 
 Yeah, that info should not have been in there, and has been reverted.-- TwoTailedFox  ( My Talk Page ) 19:01, 14 May 2007 (UTC) 
 You know, I've always played by the rules that were always used within my group of friends. We decided that in this rule of ours, monsters with the levels 1-4 require zero tributes, 5 and 6 require 1, 7 and 8 require 2, and 9-12 require 3. It's how I grew up playing the game, and I like it. I never did enter an actual tournament, so I've never played by the real rules.  DarkusMaster  ( Talk )
 
 Example images 
 Do we really need an example image for a monster of every Level? At the very most, we'd only need one, to show the reader where to find a card's Level or two if we also wanted to show a negative Level. Anyone who wants to play Yu-Gi-Oh! should already know how to count. They don't need to be shown how 4 stars is visually different than 1 star. --  Deltaneos  ( talk ) 12:35, January 13, 2010 (UTC)
 
 Level 12+? 
 Where dose it say that 12 is the Highest level, I always though it had no limit? (mind you only levels 1-12 could be printed, but alot of card effects state a monster can go over that.) For example, in Yu-Gi-Oh! 5D's World Championship 2010 Reverse of Arcadia one of the duel puzzles requires you to make a monster Level 40 in order to win. 74.241.227.202  ( talk ) 08:49, November 27, 2010 (UTC)
 
 Delta Flyer 
 If Gread Quasar can have a level over 12, shouldn't  Delta Flyer  also be part of the exceptions? It is not written on the card that a level 12 monster can't be targeted, nor specified (max 12), like for the  Fortune Lady  -- Takame9  ( talk  •  contribs ) 17:41, February 10, 2013 (UTC)
 
 Below Level 0? 
 Would it be possible to reduce a Monster's Level below 0 using card effects?  Whether it is or not, I believe it should be stated on this page so there's no future confusion about it.
 
 Ask ruling questions in the discussions page. Levels cannot go below 1.  Pitifulheartles  ( talk  •  contribs ) 11:10, 30 October 2021 (UTC)
