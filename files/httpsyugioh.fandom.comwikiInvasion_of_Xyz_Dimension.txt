 The  invasion of the Xyz Dimension  was an event in the  Yu-Gi-Oh! ARC-V  anime.
 
 History 
 Leo Akaba , the Professor of  Duel Academy , ordered his elite vanguard squad to advance into the  Xyz Dimension  and attack, as part of his plan to eventually unite the  Four Dimensions . Without warning, they did so, causing chaos with powerful monsters like " Chaos Ancient Gear Giant " and  sealing  nearly all of the inhabitants of  Heartland City  in cards in the process. [1]   Yuto ,  Shay ,  Lulu  and a  few others  were the only survivors of the attack including, although Lulu was  captured  some time later. [2] 
 
       Barrett in Heartland City.     
 In the aftermath,  Barrett  was sent to the ruined Heartland City on a mission with a few of his own comrades, but they were attacked by a " Widespread Ruin "  Trap Card . [3]  At some other point, a  Synchro Dimension  Duelist named  Yugo  appeared in Heartland, and was challenged by Yuto.  Their   dragons  fought each other until Yuto's allies appeared, at which point Yugo retreated. [2]

 Seeking to avenge their comrades, Yuto and Shay traveled to the  Standard Dimension  and began attacking the members of  Leo Institute of Dueling  that used  Fusion , sealing them into cards. Yuto attacked  Sylvio  in defense of  Zuzu Boyle  before learning that most students of LID were oblivious to the situation, [4]  while Shay attacked LID members indiscriminately, including  Marco  and  Herc ,  sealing   them  into cards. [5] [2]  Shay's attacks only stopped when he came face to face with  Declan , the person he had wanted to lure out the entire time, after a fight with  Julia ,  Dipper , and  Kit , where the former was looking to avenge her teacher. [6] 
 Shay was intent on defeating Declan and holding him hostage so that Leo would release Lulu. However, Declan told him that his plan was in vain as Declan mentioned Leo would not be interested in rescuing Declan, and instead proposed an alliance as they were fighting the same enemy, which Shay accepted. [7] [8]
