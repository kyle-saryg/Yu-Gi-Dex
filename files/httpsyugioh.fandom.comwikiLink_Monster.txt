 A  Link Monster  (Japanese: リンクモンスター  Rinku Monsutā ) is a type of  Monster Card . The color of their card frame is dark blue, which is similar to that of a  Ritual Monster , but with a hexagonal pattern similar to a honeycomb structure. They first appeared in the  Yu-Gi-Oh! VRAINS  anime, and were introduced to the  OCG  and  TCG  in the  Structure Deck: Cyberse Link .
 These cards are placed in the  Extra Deck . Like other Extra Deck monsters, Link Monsters cannot exist in either the  hand  or the  Main Deck  (even with card effects). If a Link Monster would be moved to the hand or Main Deck, it is returned to the Extra Deck instead. If a card like " Transmigration Break " or " Degenerate Circuit " is applying, the Link Monster would be  banished  rather than returning to the Extra Deck.
 If a Link Monster is not  Link Summoned  first, it cannot be  Special Summoned  from the  Graveyard  or while  banished  (unless it specifies another way to properly Special Summon it).

 Link Ratings and lack of DEF 
 Main article:  Link Rating 
 Link Monsters have a  Link Rating  in place of a  Level  or  Rank . A Link Monster's Link Rating determines the total number of  Link Materials  required to  Link Summon  it. A Link Monster's Link Rating is also equal to the number of  Link Arrows  it has. A Link Monster's Link Rating can be found next to its  ATK , in place of the traditional  DEF  value.
 Link Monsters do not possess Levels or Ranks, therefore they cannot be used as material for a  Ritual ,  Synchro , or  Xyz Summon . Also, Level or Rank-modifying cards such as " Harmonic Waves ", " Feedback Warrior ", or " Xiangsheng Magician " do not affect Link Monsters. The same thing can be said for Spells/Traps that affect Levels/Ranks such as " Gravity Bind ", " Level Limit - Area B " or " Planckton ".
 Link Monsters can only exist in  face-up   Attack Position  (they do not have a DEF value) and cannot be placed in or changed to  Defense Position  (either manually or through a card effect). Because of this, Link Monsters are unaffected by effects that account for a monster's DEF or change  battle positions , and are unable to be placed  face-down , and cannot be Summoned by an effect that would Special Summon monsters only in Defense Position (such as " Back to the Front ").
 
 Link Arrows 
 Main article:  Link Arrow 
 Link Monsters also have  Link Arrows , indicated by red arrows radiating outward from the art frame. These indicators denote which  zones  and  monsters  that Link Monster  points to .
 Monsters in the Extra Deck ( Fusion ,  Synchro ,  Xyz , face-up  Pendulum , and Link Monsters) can be Special Summoned from the Extra Deck to a  Main Monster Zone  a Link Monster points to. From  Master Rule 5  and onward, if you already occupy an  Extra Monster Zone , you must Special Summon a Pendulum or Link monster from the Extra Deck to a zone a Link Monster points to. If a Link Monster points to a monster, the monsters are considered to be " linked " to each other.
 
 Link Summoning 
 Main article:  Link Summon 
 A Link Summon is the act of Summoning a Link Monster from the Extra Deck using the requisite number of Link Materials listed on its Link Rating. During the  Main Phase , the turn player can Link Summon by sending the  face-up  Link Materials from their field to the Graveyard.
 
 Playing style 
 Link Monsters commonly grant benefits to monsters they point to or gain more powerful effects depending on the number of monsters they point to. As such, Decks focused around Link Monsters require methods to quickly Summon monsters in order to Summon Link Monsters as well as into the zones where the Link Monsters point to. When attempting to Summon multiple Link Monsters, it is important to decide which order to Summon them in, as their Link Arrows will dictate where the others can be Summoned and what monsters will be Linked to them.
 Link Monsters with higher Link Ratings can be  Special Summoned  more quickly by Link Summoning multiple weaker Link Monsters first. This also helps to place them in locations that will take better advantage of their Link Arrows.
 Powerful Link Monsters are typically balanced by having a higher Link Rating and forward-pointing Link Arrows, allowing the opponent to summon more Extra Deck monsters. For example, " Decode Talker ", " Firewall Dragon ", " Topologic Bomber Dragon " and " Encode Talker " all have Link Arrows that point towards the opponent's field when they are placed in the Extra Monster Zone, while weaker Link Monsters such as " Missus Radiant ", " Gaia Saber, the Lightning Shadow " and " Link Spider " do not.
