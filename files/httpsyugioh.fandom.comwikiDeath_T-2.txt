 Electric Chair Ride 
 Main article:  Electric Chair Ride 
 Yugi ,  Jonouchi ,  Anzu ,  Honda  and  Kaiba's butler  were strapped into electric chairs on a train ride.  Johji  sat on Anzu's lap for the ride. The butler, who was an expert in torture put the group through a series of terrifying events on the ride. If anyone screamed, they would receive a million volt electric shock. [1] 
 Jonouchi fainted at some point on the ride, preventing himself from screaming. When Johji realized Anzu was close to screaming, he crawled back to the butler and defecated on his lap, causing him to scream in surprise, shocking himself. Without the butler orchestrating the horrors, the group reached the end of the ride alive. [1] 
 
 Bllood puzzle 
 Main article:  bllood puzzle 
 Yugi, Jonouchi, Anzu and Honda had their hands strapped into a guillotine, set to fall after five minutes, during which they needed to answer a riddle. The straps for their hands were labelled "10", "11", "00" and "01" and each had a button on the opposite side. One of the buttons would release their hands, while the other four would cause the guillotine to immediately fall. They had a slip of paper, with "bllood" written on it as a clue. The second "l" was also an arrow pointing downwards. [2] 
 Yugi realized that the circles and straight lines creating the letters in "bllood" could also be read as "10 11 00 01", the numbers on the guillotine. Since the eleven had the arrow, he concluded that it must correspond to the button they needed to push to stop the guillotine. [2] 
 
 Deathmatch 
 Main article:  Jonouchi and the Chopman's deathmatch 
 After the bllood puzzle, Johji was kidnapped by the  Chopman . In order to save him, Jonouchi had to take part in a  deathmatch  with the Chopman in a small chamber. The two players were handcuffed together by a long chain, strung through a pedestal. The Chopman's chainsaw got stuck in the pedestal. While he tried to free it, Jonouchi used his lock picking skills to take off his end of the handcuff using a candle stick. He attached the handcuff to the door and placed the candle inside the cuff. When the Chopman yanked the chain, expecting to pull Jonouchi over to him, he ripped open the door. While Jonouchi escaped out the door, the candle hit the oil on the floor, setting the Chopman on fire. [3]
