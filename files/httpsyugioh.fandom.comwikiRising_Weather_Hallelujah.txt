 English 
 Sailing my sea! 
Yeah - Never say die Gotta go! Go! 
 Unfold the map to tomorrow, let’s go together, Go along along 
If you peek through a telescope, head to the unknown harbor, Go along along 
 Get on the deck! Get on the deck! Take the helm with your hands 
Get on the deck! Get on the deck! Sail out to the sea of dawn 
 With all your might, hallelujah- Now raise the sails together with your friends 
Underneath the fine weathered-sky, head to the great voyage named ‘dream’ 
Nothing is unsurpassable; control the wind 
And freely go anywhere 
 Leap on Leap on, look at the sky, look at the sea 
Dyed in one color of blue 
Because you want to know more about unknown things and such, Go! Go! Depart 
 Fuel tank full, ignition spinning 
Combination with the helm, session with the waves 
Raise the tension, unfold the map, it’s an adventure 
Escape through the danger, ocean liner 
 Get on the deck! Get on the deck! Head to a new tomorrow 
Get on the deck! Get on the deck! Head to the other side of the horizon 
 Yeah - Never say die Gotta go! Go! Go! Go! 
 Underneath the fine weathered-sky, now raise the sails together with your friends 
With all your might, hallelujah- head to the great voyage named ‘dream’ 
Nothing is unsurpassable; control the wind 
And freely go anywhere
