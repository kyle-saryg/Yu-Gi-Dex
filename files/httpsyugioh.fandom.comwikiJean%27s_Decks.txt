 Jean uses a  Beatdown Deck  focused on constantly and brutally attacking the opponent with  monsters  such as " Rhinotaurus ". Jean's Deck also contains a large amount of cards to  destroy  the opponent's  Spell  and  Trap Cards  such as " Hypnocorn " and " Chain Whirlwind ", ensuring his tactics aren't interrupted. He also utilizes the " Unicorn "  series  to shift strategies to work in tandem with his teammate's strategies.
