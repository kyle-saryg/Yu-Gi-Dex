He then activates " Shield & Sword ", switching the ATK and DEF of all face-up monsters on the field ("Flame Swordsman": 1800 → 1600/1600 → 1800) ("Summoned Skull": 2500 → 1200/1200 → 2500).

 Turn 11: Yami Yugi 
Yugi draws and knowing about Joey's counterattack, Yugi does not rise to the bait and  Sets  a card under one of the hats.
 Turn 12: Joey 
Joey draws and attacks another of the hats with "B. Skull Dragon", but once again, it is empty.
 Turn 13: Yami Yugi 
Yugi draws and passes his turn.
 Turn 14: Joey 
Joey draws and attacks and destroys a third hat with "B. Skull Dragon", and, by process of elimination, hits something. However, that something is revealed to be Yugi's Set " Spellbinding Circle ", which activates, reducing the ATK of "B. Skull Dragon" by 700 (3200 → 2500/2500) and preventing it from attacking. Joey switches "Garoozis" into Defense Position.
 Turn 15: Yami Yugi 
Yugi draws " Book of Secret Arts " and activates it. Yami releases "Dark Magician" from its hat and equips it with "Book of Secret Arts", increasing its ATK by 300 (2500 → 2800/2100). Yugi attacks and destroys "B. Skull Dragon" with "Dark Magician" (Joey: 750 → 450).
 Turn 16: Joey 
Even though he lost "Black Skull Dragon", Joey is encouraged by Serenity to keep fighting. Joey draws and Summons " Baby Dragon " (1200/700) in Attack Position, then Sets a card.
 Turn 17: Yami Yugi 
Yugi draws and thinks Joey's Face-Down Card is "Time Wizard". Yugi attacks "Baby Dragon" with "Dark Magician" to prevent "Baby Dragon" from evolving into "Thousand Dragon", but Joey activates his Set " Kunai with Chain ", stopping the attack.
 Turn 18: Joey 
Joey draws and activates " Time Wizard " (500/400) as a  Spell Card . He succeeds with the roulette ability of "Time Wizard", causing every monster on the field to age rapidly. "Baby Dragon" ages into " Thousand Dragon " (2400/2000), and "Dark Magician" ages into an elderly version of himself (100/???). 
 Joey could not believe it. This would win the duel for him if he attacked.
 Joey attacks the elderly Dark Magician with "Thousand Dragon", but Yugi uses the effect of the elderly Dark Magician to activate " Makiu, the Magical Mist " from his  hand , stopping the attack.
 Yugi also reveals that thanks to Joey, his elderly Dark Magician was able to learn 1,000 years worth of Magic, making him stronger, and transforming him into the " Dark Sage ".
 Turn 19: Yami Yugi 
Instead of drawing, Yugi activates the second effect of "Dark Sage", allowing him to add a  Magic Card  from his Deck to his hand. Before he makes his move, Yugi cries knowing he is about to take away Joey's only chance to save his sister, telling Joey this is the hardest move he has ever made. He activates the added " Monster Reborn ", reviving "B. Skull Dragon" from Joey's Graveyard. Joey is sad that Yugi has beaten him, but tells him it's fine. Yugi attacks and destroys "Thousand Dragon" with "B. Skull Dragon" (Joey: 450 → 0).
 Yugi wins.
 
 Aftermath 
 Yugi advances to the final match with Pegasus. Joey offers his " Glory of the King's Hand " to Yugi, but Yugi refuses it and allows Joey to collect the prize money with the card, saying that he deserves it more. Joey cries tears of joy and the final match against Pegasus soon begins.
