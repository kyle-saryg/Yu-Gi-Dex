 Summary 
       Yuma  points to where  Astral  is in  Tori 's and  Bronk 's view.     
 Astral  has just appeared before  Yuma , telling him to win. Yuma asks Astral who is he, but he doesn't say anything. When Yuma asks again, Astral introduces himself. Yuma finds that name weird but Astral is certain of that name since he remembers it.  Tori  and  Bronk  ask Yuma why he is talking to himself. Yuma asks if they can't see him; he points to where Astral is but his friends can't see him. Bronk thinks that Yuma is so scared that he's lost his mind and knew him challenging Shark was too much for him, to which Yuma argues saying he's not scared. Yuma then wonders whether he is the only one who can see it or it's just his  Duel Gazer  that's broken. Astral says Yuma can't understand Astral's existence and Yuma asks Astral if he's a ghost. Astral then asks Yuma what kind of effect a ghost has and when it activates.
 Astral then realizes he has lost his memory when he arrived in this world. He assumes that some kind of impact scattered his memories. Yuma doesn't understand a word of what Astral is saying and thinks he has totally lost it. He complains about why that had to happen during such an important Duel. Astral tells him to calm down to which Yuma accuses Astral that all this was his fault.
 Tori wonders if Yuma is okay since he's been talking to himself for a while. Bronk comments he knew challenging Shark to a Duel was too much for Yuma to handle. Tori doesn't like this argument and yells at Bronk saying he's not allowed to wimp because both his and Yuma's Deck are riding on this Duel. She also says they will not let Shark take those decks away and cheers Yuma, telling him to get his mind together. Yuma says he already has. Yuma then realizes he is the only one who can see Astral.
 Yuma feels that, ever since that " Number " card appeared, the feeling he gets from  Shark  has changed. Shark contemplates his new  Xyz Monster , " Number 17: Leviathan Dragon " and says that when this Xyz Monster appeared, energy started rushing into him and he feels like he can't lose to anyone. He then says he will definitely take Yuma's Deck. He  Sets  a card and ends his  turn .
 After that, Astral thinks there should be some kind of important memory linked with the Numbers monsters. Astral says that his instincts are telling him to win this  Duel . Yuma asks Astral if he knows anything about Duels to which Astral answers he's actually a Duelist. Yuma finds it odd that there is a ghost that's a  Duelist . Astral cries out he's a Duelist and says it's his turn. Yuma points out it's HIS turn and  draws a card . 
 
       Astral announces the Summon of " Gogogo Golem ".     
 Astral looks at the card and says he Summons " Gogogo Golem " in  Defense Position . Yuma warns Astral not to butt into his Duel and Summons "Gogogo Golem" in  Attack Position  instead. Astral notes that an attack of 1800 points isn't enough to defeat Shark's monster. Yuma answers saying he knows that and plays the  Spell  card, " Blustering Winds ", increasing the  ATK  of "Gogogo Golem"  to 2800 until his next turn. Yuma  attacks  "Leviathan Dragon" with "Gogogo Golem" and happily celebrates, because he believes "Leviathan Dragon" was  destroyed  and because he's just lowered Shark's  LP . Astral tells him to look at the  field  and "Leviathan Dragon" is still there. Tori asks Bronk why "Leviathan Dragon" wasn't destroyed even though Shark's life was lowered. She reminds him that, if they're both in Attack Position, the one with more ATK is supposed to win. Yuma also asks Shark why "Leviathan Dragon" wasn't destroyed. 
 
       Shark explains the  effect  of " Number " monsters.     
 Shark explains that a Numbers monster can only be defeated by another Numbers monster. Yuma starts to despair because he doesn't have a Numbers monster. Bronk wonders that, if a Number can only be destroyed by another, what are people supposed to do in that situation.
Yuma contradicts Shark, saying that Numbers aren't the issue since the ATK of "Gogogo Golem" is still higher than that of "Leviathan Dragon". Astral alerts Yuma, telling him that, on the next turn, "Gogogo Golem" will be destroyed and that, if Shark has a monster with 800 ATK or more in his  hand , they already can't win this Duel. Yuma doesn't believe in that since his LP are still 1000. Astral says that the first result of his observations is that Yuma's Duel tactics are by far inferior when compared to his. Yuma feels insulted by the word "inferior" but then asks what "tactics" are. Astral explains it's his strategy. Yuma still doesn't get the meaning.
 Shark declares that this draw will decide the Duel. He draws and Summons " Drill Barnacle " with 300 ATK. Astral says they're safe and Yuma asks what Astral is on about. Shark activates the effect of "Leviathan Dragon",  detaching  its last  Overlay Unit  to increase the ATK of "Leviathan Dragon" to 3000. Yuma is surprised but Astral points out that, because "Leviathan Dragon" still had an Xyz Material monster, it was obvious Shark was going to use that effect. Shark attacks "Gogogo Golem" with "Leviathan Dragon", lowering Yuma's LP to 800. Yuma realises that Astral knew this was going to happen. After that, Shark attacks Yuma  directly  with "Drill Barnacle", lowering his LP to 500.
 Astral then explains that, when "Gogogo Golem" is in Defense Position, once per turn, it cannot be destroyed by battle and that, if Yuma had done what he said, he wouldn't be in this pinch. Yuma tells Astral to shut up. Astral then looks at his hand and notices it's transparent, seeing that as if it's his own life being depleted. Astral then remembers that Numbers are pieces of his memory and explains that Numbers are special cards among Xyz Monsters because, not only they cannot be defeated by cards of this world, the one who wins in a fight between Numbers absorbs the loser's Number. Yuma asks Astral what he means by all that and Astral sums it up, saying that, if they cannot win this Duel, he will be erased from this world. He tells Yuma that they must win. Yuma says he already was trying to win from the start. Yuma thinks to himself, saying he doesn't have any cards that could work as a counter-attack.
 
         " Drill Barnacle " grows.     
 But, if he can, at least, stop the attack of "Leviathan Dragon"'s on the next turn, he'll still have 200 LP left even if he takes that attack of "Drill Barnacle". Shark sees through Yuma's line of thinking and tells him it's useless. The effect of "Drill Barnacle" activates, increasing its ATK by 1000.
 Yuma starts to panic, realizing that he's about to lose and doesn't know what to do, but he then sees he had a  Trap Card  Set on the field. He checks it and it shows it's " Bye Bye Damage ". Astral explains that, if he had activated it, on top of dealing damage to Shark, "Gogogo Golem" wouldn't have been destroyed. Yuma yells at Astral, saying he forgot about the trap because he was grumbling at him. Shark suggests Yuma should just give up, but Yuma says he won't do such a thing. Shark then asks if he's telling him he still has a way to win to which Yuma only answers he'll never give up. Shark says that he doesn't like hearing those words. Astral calms Yuma, telling him that there's still a chance but the requirements for that chance is summoning two monsters. He tells Yuma to listen carefully, calling him "Um". Yuma says his name is Yuma. Astral tells him again to listen carefully, this time, calling him "Toma". Yuma yells it's not Toma, it's Yuma. Astral says that, with this next draw, he has to pull a card that can Special Summon monsters.
 Yuma draws " Monster Reborn ". Astral comments that destiny hasn't abandoned him yet but Yuma says he was the one who drew that card. Yuma Summons " Ganbara Knight " in Attack Position. Bronk is baffled by this play since the ATK of "Ganbara Knight" is 0. Yuma realizes he has just made a mistake and Shark points out that, since he has already won, Yuma could just give up. Yuma again replies that he'll never give up because he can do "kattobingu" anytime. Astral doesn't understand what "kattobingu" is and Yuma explains it's the same as taking on a challenge. The same as having a heart that never gives up and he adds that when a person gives up, their heart dies. Shark is extremely angry, accusing Yuma that all he's saying is just wind and saying that it's guys like Yuma that irritate him the most. Shark asks Yuma how he's going to stand up against his two monsters with a monster with 0 ATK.
 Astral says that it's just fine because, if "Toma" had played it in Defense Position, their chance for a counter-attack would have been lost. Yuma again yells at Astral, reminding him that his name is Yuma. Astral tells Yuma to  revive  " Gagaga Magician " with "Monster Reborn". Yuma is unsure about this move, but Astral says he can't disappear and tells him to trust him. Yuma agrees to do so, but notes it doesn't mean he believes in Astral. Yuma activates "Monster Reborn",  Special Summoning  "Gagaga Magician" from the Graveyard in Attack Position. Shark asks what's the point in Summoning a 1500 ATK monster now. Astral says that the requirements are in place and tells Yuma to overlay his two monsters. Yuma tells him that's impossible since doing so is an Xyz Summon. Astral tells Yuma to look at his  Extra Deck . Yuma opens it and takes an Xyz Monster from it. However, he doesn't know that Xyz Monster and says he can't even read its text. Astral can read it and says it " Number 39: Utopia ". Yuma asks Astral if this is a Numbers monster and Astral says it is and that it's the power that was granted to him.
 Yuma overlays "Gagaga Magician" and "Ganbara Knight", both  Level  4 monsters, Xyz Summoning "Number 39: Utopia". Yuma and Astral order "Utopia" to attack "Drill Barnacle", lowering Shark's LP to 2500. Shark is surprised to see another Numbers monster. Astral calls it the trump card for defeating "Leviathan Dragon". Bronk and Tori are both surprised to see such a monster and Tori asks Bronk if Yuma had a monster like that. Bronk says he didn't as much as he tries to think about it. Yuma ends his turn, then feels extremely happy for performing his first Xyz Summon. He goes to his friends and asks them if they saw that and Tori says they did. 
 
         Yuma's feeling of personal achievement.     
 Yuma feels blessed, saying his "kattobingu" has finally paid off. Bronk asks Yuma why he's so happy, the ATK of "Utopia" is still less than that of "Leviathan Dragon". Yuma remembers that fact and says that's bad.
 Shark says that, even though Yuma Summoned a Numbers monster, he's still no match for him. Shark draws a card and activates " Surface ", Special Summoning " Big Jaws " from his Graveyard in Defense Position. Afterwards, he  Tributes  "Big Jaws" to  Tribute Summon  " Jawsman ". Tori asks about Tribute Summoning and Bronk explains that it's a way of Summoning a high Level monster by sacrificing another monster.
 Through its own effect, the ATK of "Jawsman" is 2900. Shark declares this is the end and attacks "Utopia" with "Leviathan Dragon". Yuma again panics and asks Astral if "Utopia" has some sort of effect. Astral explains that the effect is, by detaching an Xyz Material Monster to the Graveyard, he may  negate  an attack. Yuma says that he should have told that sooner. Yuma activates the effect of "Utopia" effect and sends "Ganbara Knight" to the Graveyard to negate the attack of "Leviathan Dragon". Shark now knows what the effect of "Utopia" is and alerts Yuma that, if he just dodges attacks without defeating his monsters, he can't win. Shark says that, although a Numbers monster can't be defeated by any other monster,  Damage Calculation  still passes and tells Yuma that, if he wants to escape this damage, he'll have to use his last Xyz Material Monster. Shark attacks "Utopia" with "Jawsman". Astral tells Yuma that, right now, it's as Shark is saying and tells him to use the effect of "Utopia" again. Yuma keeps thinking about a way to defeat Shark's monsters and activates his  face-down  "Bye Bye Damage". Astral asks Yuma why he didn't use the effect of "Utopia" again" and Yuma answers by saying that he is. Through Bye Bye Damage, Shark's life is lowered to 1700 and Yuma is left with 100 LP.
 Shark, thanks to Yuma's trap, is now able to activate his own Trap Card, " Booming Urchin ", which will inflict 1000 damage to Yuma on Shark's next turn. Shark says that now his victory is assured. Bronk and Tori give up hope with Bronk saying Yuma has already lost. Shark tells Yuma to give up and Yuma says he's not done and that he won't give up yet. Shark tells Yuma he only has one more turn and asks him why he isn't giving up on the Duel. Yuma, in return, asks Shark why he wants Yuma to give up so badly and if Shark hasn't given up on something precious. Through these words, for a brief moment, Shark overcomes the possession but is possessed again. Yuma tells Shark that, as long as he doesn't give up, he can do "kattobingu" anytime and he is going to show him that. Astral asks Yuma if there really is a way to turn the Duel around. Yuma answers there is, remembering a combo in his deck. Yuma then picks up  Grandma 's meal and eats it, calling it his victory meal.
 
         The  ATK  of " Utopia " is doubled.     
 Yuma begins his turn and declares that, right now, if he's going to win, it has to be now. He says his catch-phrase, "Kattobingu Da Ore" and draws his final card, moving a lot on the air and, because of that, he falls to the ground. He then looks at his card and attacks "Leviathan Dragon" with "Utopia".
Astral, Tori and Bronk are all surprised to see Yuma attacking with a monster with lower ATK. Yuma activates the effect of "Utopia", negating its own attack. Shark asks what's the point in a combo that can't deal damage to him. Yuma says the point is that it's over and activates the  Quick-Play Spell , " Double or Nothing! ", doubling the ATK of "Utopia" and allowing it to attack again. Yuma attacks "Leviathan Dragon" again and wins the Duel.
 Yuma, Tori and Bronk are surprised to see Yuma winning a Duel, but, after overcoming that surprise, they're all happy for Yuma. Shark's lackeys, after seeing Shark lose, leave him, saying he's fallen too low. Astral takes "Leviathan Dragon" and finds out that, if he gathers all ninety-nine of the scattered Numbers cards, he will recover his memory. Yuma grabs his pendant and, in his mind, tells his  Mother  and  Father  he's won. Shark, although feeling disgraced for having lost a Duel, goes to Yuma and gives him Bronk's Deck as agreed. He leaves, saying he will remember this. Yuma tells Shark he had a lot of fun and says they should Duel again someday, without betting Decks, just so that both of them can do "kattobingu". After hearing this, Shark, always with his back turned on them, leaves without saying a word. (in the dub, he says "You may have a point. Til' then, Yuma.")
 Astral now understands that what Yuma did was believing in one single draw and betting everything on it. Yuma finds Astral to be in a different mood but doesn't care much about it. Astral says that Yuma is a Duelist that exceeds his own understanding, ending his sentence again with the name "Toma". Yuma is mad about this name and jumps saying his name is not Toma, it's Yuma.(In the dub Astral says this may be the beginning of a beautiful friendship if Yuma does what he says. When Yuma jumps up he says not a chance.)
 
 Featured Duel: Yuma Tsukumo vs. Reginald "Shark" Kastle 
 Duel continues from  the previous episode 
 Turn 4: Shark 
 Shark   Sets  a card.
 Turn 5: Yuma 
 Yuma 's hand contains " Gogogo Golem ", " Ganbara Knight ", and " Goblin Out of the Frying Pan ". Yuma  draws  " Blustering Winds ". Astral tells Yuma to set "Gogogo Golem" in Defense Position, but Yuma  Normal Summons  "Gogogo Golem" ( 4/1800/1500) in Attack Position. Yuma then  activates  "Blustering Winds" to increase the  ATK  and DEF of "Gogogo Golem" by 1000 until Yuma's next  Standby Phase  ("Gogogo Golem: 1800 → 2800/1500 → 2500). "Gogogo Golem"  attacks  " Number 17: Leviathan Dragon " (Shark: 4000 → 3700 LP), but "Leviathan Dragon" is not  destroyed  since a " Number "  monster  can only be destroyed in battle by another "Number".
 Turn 6: Shark 
Shark's hand contains " Jawsman " and " Salvage ". Shark draws " Drill Barnacle " and subsequently Normal Summons it ( 3/300/0). Shark then activates the  effect  of "Leviathan Dragon" by  detaching  " Big Jaws " ("Leviathan Dragon": 1 → 0 ORU) ("Leviathan Dragon": 2500 → 3000 ATK). "Leviathan Dragon" attacks and destroys "Gogogo Golem" (Yuma: 1000 → 800 LP). "Drill Barnacle" attacks  directly  (Yuma: 800 → 500 LP). As "Drill Barnacle" inflicted  Battle Damage  via a direct attack, Shark activates its effect to increase its ATK by 1000 ("Drill Barnacle": 300 → 1300 ATK). Shark also explains that "Drill Barnacle" also has the ability to attack directly
 Turn 7: Yuma 
Yuma draws " Monster Reborn ". He then Normal Summons " Ganbara Knight " ( 4/0/1800) in Attack Position. He then activates "Monster Reborn" to revive " Gagaga Magician " ( 4/1500/1000) in Attack Position. Yuma overlays "Gagaga Magician" and "Ganbara Knight" in order to  Xyz Summon  " Number 39: Utopia " ( 4/2500/2000, ORU: 2) in Attack Position. "Utopia" attacks and destroys "Drill Barnacle" (Shark: 3700 → 2500 LP).
 Turn 8: Shark 
Shark draws " Surface " and subsequently activates it to revive "Big Jaws ( 3/1800/300) in Defense Position (as "Big Jaws" is a WATER monster). He then  Tributes  "Big Jaws" in order to  Tribute Summon  "Jawsman" ( 6/2600/1600) in Attack Position. Due to the effect of "Jawsman", it gains 300 ATK for every other  WATER  monster Shark controls ("Jawsman": 2600 → 2900 ATK). "Leviathan Dragon" attacks "Utopia", but Yuma activates the effect of "Utopia" to detach "Ganbara Knight" ("Utopia": 2 → 1 ORU) and  negate  the attack. "Jawsman" attacks "Utopia", but Yuma activates his  face-down  " Bye Bye Damage " to prevent the destruction of "Utopia" by battle (Yuma: 500 → 100 LP). Since Yuma took Battle Damage, Shark takes twice the Battle Damage Yuma just took (Yuma: 500 → 100 LP, Shark: 2500 → 1700 LP). As Yuma activated a  Trap Card , Shark activates his face-down " Booming Urchin ", which will inflict 1000  damage  to Yuma during Shark's next Standby Phase.
 Turn 9: Yuma 
Yuma draws " Double or Nothing! ". "Utopia" attacks "Leviathan Dragon", but Yuma activates the effect of "Utopia" to detach "Gagaga Magician" ("Utopia": 1 → 0 ORU) and negate the attack. As an attack was negated, Yuma activates "Double or Nothing!" to doubles the ATK of "Utopia" ("Utopia": 2500 → 5000 ATK) and allow it to attack again. "Utopia" attacks and destroys "Leviathan Dragon" (Shark: 1700 → 0 LP).
 
 Trivia 
 The animation for "Utopia" having it's ATK doubled in this episode mirrors the animation of " Stardust Dragon " having his ATK doubled in Episode 41 of  Yu-Gi-Oh! 5D's . In both cases the protagonist attacked an antagonistic main character's Ace Monster with their own Ace Monster but failed to destroy it. The protagonist then activated his ATK-doubling card and the scene changed to a 3D-rendered animation of the Ace Monster with glow around it as the camera view spins around the Monster, followed by the Ace Monster's last attack which finishes off the antagonistic main character. The scene then changes to the antagonistic main character losing all of their LP and the screen fading to white.
 In both cases, the antagonistic main character then became protagonistic. 
 Errors 
 During one scene in the dub, "Jawsman" can be seen on Yuma's D-Pad instead of "Ganbara Knight". 
 Differences in adaptions 
 In the original, Astral called Yuma "Toma" during the Duel and the ending, in the dub, Yuma asks for a please, then Astral tells him to "stop making dumb mistakes please" making Yuma mad. Later in the Duel he says perhaps and Yuma yells at him and at the ending Astral tells Yuma to listen to him and he denies in anger. 
 In the dub, after Astral says he Duels, Yuma says he knows how to tap-dance and tells him to be quiet making Tori and Bronk say "Yep, Yuma's lost it." 
 In the dub, the part where Yuma told Shark  if he has given up on something , was cut. 
 In the original, Numbers are written in alien text. In the dub, Numbers appears like any other cards shown in that version, instead they're blurred.
