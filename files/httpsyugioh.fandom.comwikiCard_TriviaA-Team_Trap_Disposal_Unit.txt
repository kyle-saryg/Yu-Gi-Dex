 " Koitsu ", " Doitsu ", " Soitsu ", " Aitsu " and " Bear Trap " appear in this card's artwork.
 For unknown reasons, this is a  Machine  monster, while the 4 above monsters are  Fairy  instead. 
 This makes this card one of the few cards that features a videogame-exclusive card in its artwork, along with " Trap Jammer ", " Remove Trap " and " Trap Booster ". 
 This monster appears in the artworks of " Fossil Excavation ", " Fossil Dig ", and " Secret Blast ". 
 The name "A-Team" on this card could be a reference to the popular TV series,  The A-Team . 
 Until the release of the " Number " monsters, this card was the only card with a colon (:) in its name. 
 This card has two  counterparts : one for countering  Spell Cards , " Maryokutai " and another in countering  Effect Monsters , " Doomcaliber Knight ".
