 English Dub Dates? 
 I noticed that each of the episodes starting with Episode 15 have dates for the English dub, but how is this possible when Nick has not been showing new episodes and essentially has it on hiatus?  Are there other ways to watch the English Dub?  Because I have been dying to see more! -- Starlight Keyblade  ( talk ) 07:22, August 7, 2016 (UTC)
 
 There are episodes being posted on dailymotion. Not sure what channel or location they're being aired though, probably the UK or Australia. -- MasterMarik  ( talk  â€¢  contribs ) 12:51, August 7, 2016 (UTC)
