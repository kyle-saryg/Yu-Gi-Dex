 Events 
 Prior 
 Kokurano  claimed to be able to see the future. However, he would write as many predictions as possible down, hence increasing the probability of a small amount being correct and would only reveal the ones that came true afterwards and claim to have known they were going to happen all along. He also made his spoken predictions come true.
 He predicted that a wonderful man would reveal himself to  Anzu  and she would swoon before him in love. For  Yugi 's skepticism, he predicted that countless letters would fall and bring disaster on Yugi. He later pushed a bookcase on Yugi on the library to make this come true. However Yugi switched to  Dark Yugi , who realized what Kokurano was doing, and searched for Anzu.
 To make his prediction about Anzu come true, Kokurano used chloroform to make her swoon. Dark Yugi then confronted Kokurano and challenged him to the Shadow Game.
 
 Game 
 The bottle of chloroform was placed on a number of sheets of paper on the center of a table. Players took turns pulling sheets out from under it.
 Dark Yugi went first and safely pulled a sheet out. Kokurano did the same. Dark Yugi pulled out another sheet, causing the bottle to stop with a portion of it hanging over the edge of the table. Kokurano was unable to pull out a sheet without making the bottle fall, so Dark Yugi suggested that if he really is a psychic, he should use his powers to make the bottle levitate. Kokurano attempted this and imagined he saw the bottle floating, but when he pulled the sheet it fell from the table and smashed, causing the chloroform to knock him out.
 
 Aftermath 
 As Kokurano lay unconscious, his notes on the false predictions were exposed for long enough for people to see him and realize that he was a fraud.
