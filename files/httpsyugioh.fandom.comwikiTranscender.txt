 Transcender , known as  Transer  in the Japanese version, is a character in  Yu-Gi-Oh! 5D's Duel Transer .
 
 Biograpy 
 The Transcenders are robots built by  Odin 's tribe, five thousand years ago, together with the  Yggdrasil  Tower. They serve as Odin's personal army of robots for his own purposes.
 According to  Surtr , Transcenders can use any powerful Deck such as  Greiger 's Deck, and the only thing is missing in a Transcender is the Duelist's soul.
 There are different versions of Trascenders present in the game. Two special Trascenders, one red and one blue, are named  Freki  and  Geri , and they are apparently the strongest of all Trascenders. At some point of the game, Odin reveal that also Surtr himself is actually a Transcender, despite the fact that Surtr denies this.
 
 Freki (stronger Transcender) Geri (stronger Transcender)

 In  Yu-Gi-Oh! 5D's Duel Transer , the Trascenders use many kinds of Decks, including the " Dark World ", " Lightsworn ", " Crystal Beast ", and " Gladiator Beast " archetypes. Freki plays a  WATER  Deck, and Geri a  Normal / Beatdown  deck. They also possess the ability of having three copies of  any  card,  Unlimited ,  Semi-Limited ,  Limited  or  Forbidden .
