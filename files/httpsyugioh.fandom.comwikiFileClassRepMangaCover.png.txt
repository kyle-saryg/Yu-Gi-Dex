 Biography 
       Takashi talks about  Yuma 's possible hidden potential.     Takashi is part of  Yuma 's circle of friends, with  Kotori ,  Cathy  and  Tetsuo . When he heard the rumor that Yuma defeated  Shark , he got surprised to hear it was true. He believed that Yuma must have a lot of hidden potential. [1] 
 After Yuma's loss to  Kaito Tenjo , Takashi, Tetsuo, Cathy, Kotori and  Tokunosuke  formed the  Numbers Club  in order to help Yuma. [2] 
 Later, The Numbers Club, Yuma and  Astral , went to the  Heartland Theme Park  to find " Numbers ". [3] 
 
       Takashi and the  Numbers Club  in their new outfits.     After their escape from the park, Yuma and the members of the Numbers Club gathered in  Cathy's house . Tetsuo asked Cathy what she wanted to show them. She pressed a cat paw-like button, which opened a door leading to a big room, with many researchers and big computers. Cathy explained that as an apology for the trouble she caused, the Numbers Club's headquarters would be established there, where they could look up mysterious phenomenons happening throughout the world, and therefore, locate the "Numbers". The Numbers Club then started helping Yuma, wearing new super hero-like outfits. [4]
