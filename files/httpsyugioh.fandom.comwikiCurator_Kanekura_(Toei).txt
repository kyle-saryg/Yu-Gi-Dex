 Curator Kanekura  ( 金倉 館長   Kanekura Kanchō ) is a character in the  Toei  Yu-Gi-Oh!  anime . He is the anime incarnation of the  Yu-Gi-Oh!  manga  character,  Curator Kanekura . Kanekura is the curator of  Domino City Museum  and exhibited the  Millennium Puzzle  after  Yugi Mutou  lent it to him for one day.
 Kanekura is a greedy individual, who cares much about money and his own life, but little for anything else, and was willing to lie to others to get what he wanted.
 
 Biography 
 Kenekura sponsored  an excavation  in the  Valley of the Kings  of a Pharaoh's tomb from the New Kingdom era. Two months later the findings were put on display at  Domino City Museum  in the  Egypt Unearthed  exhibition.
 Kanekura heard from  Professor Yoshimori  that  Yugi Mutou  had the  Millennium Puzzle . He then made plans to steal the puzzle, sell it and give Yugi a portion of the profit to keep him quiet. On the day of the Egypt Unearthed exhibition, Kanekura begged Yugi to allow him to put the Millennium Puzzle on display. Yugi was a bit reluctant, but allowed him to borrow it for one day. The puzzle was put on display and Kanekura showed it to  a potential buyer .
 Kanekura was visited by  Shadi , who had come to put him on trial for defiling the tomb in the Valley of the Kings. Shadi proceeded to perform the  Weighing of the Heart   on Kanekura . He asked Kanekura a series of questions and used the  Millennium Scales  and  Feather of Ma'at  to measure his truthfulness. Shadi warned Kanekura that he would suffer a  Penalty Game  if the side of the scales weighing Kanekura's lies hit the table. Kanekura's claim that he would save a girl over stealing her golden ring was interpreted as a lie. Before his final question, he asked what a  Penalty Game  was, so Shadi used an illusion to transform Kanekura's chair into  Ammit , and said that this creature would be set free in his  soul room . Kanekura was driven insane and became injured after failing the weighing.
