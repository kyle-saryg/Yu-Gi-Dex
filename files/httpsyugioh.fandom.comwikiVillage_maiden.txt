 The  village maiden  is an NPC girl in  Yu-Gi-Oh! Capsule Monsters . She appears in  Episode 9  and  Episode 10 .
 
 History 
 She volunteered as a sacrifice to the  Blue-Eyes White Dragon  to keep her village safe from the Fiendish Five dragons. Yugi's group arrived and vowed to spare her soul by slaying the dragons, and she relayed the prophecy of the Sword of Divinity to them. When the dragons combined into the  Five-Headed Dragon , her prayers and tears awakened the Blue-Eyes and let  Yami Yugi  merge with it, putting an end to the dragons once and for all. The maiden thanked Yugi for his help, then joked that they had to answer one more riddle before leaving.
