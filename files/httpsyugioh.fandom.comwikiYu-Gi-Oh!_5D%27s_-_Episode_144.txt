 Summary 
 Present 
 Vizor  informs  Yusei  that he has regained his memories. He states "The opponent you will face..." and removes his visor and finishes "... is me.". Seeing Vizor's full face, Yusei realizes that he is Bruno. Vizor identifies himself as Antinomy, the protector of the  Planetary Gear  and the  Divine Temple .
 Yusei and Antinomy engage in a  Turbo Duel  and the setting suddenly changes to outer space with the two of them racing along a white path. Antinomy says that this is a very fitting scene for his final time facing Yusei. He explains that this is a  Death Course . The two of them are racing near a star, which the loser will be sucked into upon losing and neither of them will be able to leave until that happens.
 Yusei and Antinomy race along the track for a while, dodging flames that leap by them. Antinomy says that the loser shall be swallowed by the flames and the only means of escape is to win the Duel.
 
       The data screen as  Antinomy   Synchro Summons .     
 Antinomy goes first and  Normal Summons  " Tech Genus Catapult Dragon ". Its effect lets him  Special Summon  a  Level  3 or lower  Tuner monster  from his  hand  once per turn, so he Summons " Tech Genus Jet Falcon ". He then tunes the Level 2 "Catapult Dragon" to the Level 3 "Jet Falcon" and  recites   "Limiter removal, Level 5. Regulator open. Thruster warm-up, okay. Up link, all clear. Go! Synchro Summon! Come on, Tech Genus Hyper Librarian!" , as he  Synchro Summons  " Tech Genus Hyper Librarian ". Since "Jet Falcon" was used as  Synchro Material , Yusei takes 500  damage , dropping his  Life Points  to 3500.
 Waves of flames splash over the track and Yusei barely manages to avoid being hit. Antinomy calls back to Yusei and says that if something this small is enough to throw him off, he will be swallowed by the flames before they finish the Duel.
 Antinomy  Sets  1 card in his  Spell & Trap Card Zone  and ends his turn.
 
       The flames build up around the track.     
 Yusei's turn begins, but he does nothing. Antinomy asks why he is hesitating and recalls how Yusei had said he was going to defeat any enemy standing in his way, regardless of who they are. Yusei suggests that the same may not apply if they are his friend. Annoyed, Antinomy reminds Yusei that if he doesn't defeat him, he won't be able to advance any further than this and won't be able to save his friends. Yusei starts to worry. He rides up beside Antinomy, who says that Yusei is incapable of leaving his feelings of a former friend out of it and that is both his greatest strength and weakness. Antinomy slams  Delta Eagle  against  Yusei Go  and demands that Yusei show him his dueling.
 Yusei  draws  his card and both players  SPC  goes up to 1. Yusei Normal Summons " Junk Synchron " and since he  controls  a " Junk " monster, he Special Summons " Junk Servant " from his hand. Yusei thinks that as long as Antinomy controls Synchro Monsters, he is going to attempt to perform an  Accel Synchro Summon  and concludes that he must break the Synchro Monsters before then. Yusei tunes his Level 4 "Junk Servant" and his Level 3 "Junk Synchron" and chants  "Clustering anger becomes an entranced warrior conceived by a kishin. Become the path its light shines upon! Synchro Summon! Howl, Junk Berserker!"  as he Synchro Summons " Junk Berserker ". Antinomy draws a card through the effect of "Hyper Librarian", since a player Synchro Summoned.
 
       Antinomy blocks the attack from " Junk Berserker ".     
 Yusei  activates  the effect of "Junk Berserker". He  removes  "Junk Servant" from his Graveyard from play to reduce the ATK of "Hyper Librarian" by the ATK of "Junk Servant", causing it to drop to 900. Yusei then gets "Junk Berserker" to attack "Hyper Librarian". However Antimony is insulted that Yusei may have though such a low level strategy would work against him and activates his  face-down  card " Sonic Stun ", which  negates  the attack and lets him Special Summon a Level 4 or lower Tuner monster from his hand, so he Special Summons " Tech Genus Cyber Magician ".
 Yusei Sets one card in his Spell & Trap Card Zone and ends his turn. Antinomy says that Yusei's confusion has set the breaks on this Duel. In his current state, Antinomy says that Yusei has no hope of keeping up in this Duel.
 Antinomy begins his turn and both players SPC raises to 2. He Normal Summons " Tech Genus Rush Rhino " and tunes his Level 4 "Rush Rhino" with his Level 1 "Cyber Magician" and recites  "Limited removal, level 5. Booster launch, okay. Inclination, okay. Ground support, all clear. Go! Synchro Summon! Come on, Tech Genus Wonder Magician" , as he Synchro Summons " Tech Genus Wonder Magician ". This lets him draw another card through the effect of "Hyper Librarian".
 Yusei tries warning Antinomy about an oncoming wave of fire, but Antinomy just rides straight through it, to Yusei's amazement.
 Antinomy tells Yusei to watch closely as he performs a true " Clear Mind ". He tunes his Level 5 "Wonder Magician" to his Level 5 "Hyper Librarian" and recites  "Limiter removal, Level 10. Main bass booster control, all clear. Infinite power, unleashed here and now, break through this very dimension and beyond. Go! Accel Synchro! Come on, Tech Genus Blade Gunner!" , as he Accel Synchro Summons " Tech Genus Blade Blaster ".
 Yusei asks why Antinomy taught him how to Accel Synchro Summon. Antinomy explains that had he not, Yusei and  Team 5D's  would not have been able to win the  World Racing Grand Prix  and it was that power, which helped them bring out the Ark Cradle in their battle with  Aporia .
 "Blade Blaster"  attacks  "Junk Berserker" with its " Shoot Blade " attack and  destroys  it, causing Yusei's Life Points to fall to 2700. Since a Synchro Monster was destroyed, Antinomy Special Summons " Tech Genus Metal Skeleton " from his hand. "Metal Skeleton" then attacks Yusei  directly , dropping Yusei to 1600. Antinomy Sets a card in his Spell & Trap Card Zone and ends his turn.
 Antinomy states that Yusei's heart is in disarray and in his current condition he has no hope of defeating  Z-one , let alone defeating him. Yusei asks just who Z-one is, to which Antinomy replies that he is someone who will change the future of ruin. Antinomy calms down and tells Yusei about he met Z-one.
 
 Apocalyptic future 
         Antinomy in his pro dueling days.     
 In the apocalyptic future, Antinomy was a pro Turbo Duelist. His hope derived from the dreams he had of showing people all over the world the magnificence of dueling and he had never doubted his beliefs.
 
         Antinomy is told that he can't Synchro Summon.     
 Antinomy won a Turbo Duel tournament and held a trophy up in front of a cheering audience. Afterwards, he becomes furious as he is told by  his manager  that he can't Synchro Summon, as it has been outlawed. The manager explains that they are in an unstable situation, where anything could happen and Antinomy can't just selfishly go about Synchro Summoning as he pleases. But to Antinomy this is all the more reason, as they should be aiming to find the correct way to use Synchro Monsters and points out that in the past the legendary Duelist, Yusei Fudo, used Synchro Monsters and countless people got hope from him.
 A crew  rushes over to Antinomy and his manager, to inform that a main network is after going berserk as a result of  Ener-D 's interaction with Synchro Summoning. The manager realizes that if that is true, something bad is about to happen. The invasion of  Meklord Emperors  then appear in the sky and brought about destruction.
 Later, Antinomy walks along the streets of the now destroyed city, with no other survivors in sight. He wonders if Synchro Summoning caused this to happen and drops to his knees, where he finds a Synchro Monster card, " Scrap Dragon ".
 
         Antinomy prepares to be shot.     
 A  Meklord Emperor Granel Infinity  appears before Antinomy and starts scanning him, before pointing a cannon at his face. Antinomy closes his eyes, ready to accept his fate. However the Meklord Emperor is shot by a blast and falls to the ground. After the smoke clears, Antinomy looks up to an above platform and sees what looks like Yusei Fudo in Yusei Go, with a cannon attached to it. Antinomy says "You can't be", but Yusei ramps down and gets out of his vehicle. He walks towards Antinomy and shakes his hand.
 
         Z-one , looking like Yusei Fudo.     
 Antinomy narrates that the person, who saved him was Z-one. He was lost in despair and saw Z-one fighting with hope. He was ashamed of himself.
 Much later, the only four survivors, Antinomy, Z-one,  Paradox  and  Aporia  devoted themselves to performing experiments in the hopes of saving the world from destruction. The experiments took up a lot of their time and their lives reached an end.
 As Antinomy lies in his deathbed, Aporia and Z-one, who is now in his machine form watched over him. Z-one tells him in order to save the world they will need his strength. Antinomy says that he has no doubt that the day will come when the world will be saved. To ensure this, he asks that he be put to work as Z-one's servant.
 
 Present 
 Antinomy says that soon afterwards all of Z-one's friends died and just like the others, Z-one resurrected Antinomy as his servant to change the future. Yusei, who has not been told that Z-one looked like him, begins to ask something about Z-one. Before he can finish his question, Antinomy says that it is correct, Z-one is the lone survivor of mankind. Yusei thinks that that can't be.
 Antinomy explains that Aporia was split into three embodiments of despair and was resurrected as three separate personalities, as the controllers of  Iliaster . Antinomy was given the mission to protect Yusei and aid in his growth. He admits to not thinking Yusei would progress this far and didn't think that he himself would be the one to crush Yusei.
 Yusei asks if Antinomy considers him to be no more than a gear in his plans. Antinomy says that the Ark Cradle has surfaced and  New Domino City  is as good as confirmed, so the creation of a new future is all but assured. However the completion of that plan allows no room for Yusei to advance any further.
 Yusei demands that Antinomy not talk like that and points out that it wasn't just him Antinomy deceived, but every one in Team 5D's. He asks if Antinomy honestly sees hope in this future he is trying to create by sacrificing this world. He demands that Antinomy answer. Antinomy says that similar to how team 5D's are connected by a strong bond, he Z-one and his friends have formed a strong bond within the pit of despair and his very mission is his pledge to Z-one.
 Yusei asks if that is what Antinomy really wants to do and calls him Bruno. He replies that his name is Antinomy, and Yusei vows to defeat him for the sake of the future and his friends. 
 Yusei begins his turn and both players SPC goes up to 3. Yusei activates " Speed Spell - Angel Baton ", drawing two cards and sending one card, " Stardust Xiaolong " to the Graveyard. Since he controls no monsters, while Antinomy does, Yusei Special Summons " Unknown Synchron " from his hand. He  Releases  "Unknown Synchron" to  Advance Summon  " Salvage Warrior ". Since "Salvage Warrior" was Advanced Summoned, he is able to Special Summon a Tuner monster from his hand or  Graveyard , so he revives "Junk Synchron" from his Graveyard.
 Yusei tunes his Level 5 "Salvage Warrior" to his Level 3 "Junk Synchron" and chants  "Clustering wishes will become a new shining star. Become the path its light shines upon. Synchro Summon! Take flight, Stardust Dragon!"  as he Synchro Summons " Stardust Dragon ". Since he Summoned "Stardust Dragon", he is able to revive the "Stardust Xiaolong" from his Graveyard. He then activates " Graceful Revival ", Special Summoning "Unknown Synchron" from his Graveyard. He then tunes his Level 1 "Stardust Xiaolong" to his Level 1 "Unknown Synchron" and chants  "Clustering wishes will call out a new speed's horizon. Become the path its light shines upon. Synchro Summon! The power of hope, Synchro Tuner, Formula Synchron!" , as he Synchro Summons " Formula Synchron ".
 
         Yusei performs  Clear Mind .     
 Antinomy predicts an Accel Synchro Summon. Yusei activates the effect of "Formula Synchron", which lets him draw a card once per turn. [Note 1]  Yusei says that he shall no longer hesitate and if it means protecting his friends his answer lies here; The new power he has obtained "Clear Mind". The complete  Mark of the Dragon , sans Leo's mark appears behind him. He tunes his Level 8 "Stardust Dragon" to his Level 2 "Formula Synchron" and chants  "Clustering crystal dreams open the door to a new evolution. Become the path its light shines upon. Accel Synchro! Be born, Shooting Star Dragon!" , as he Accel Synchro Summons " Shooting Star Dragon ".
 Antinomy guesses Yusei has now gotten serious and Yusei vows to fight Antinomy past his limits. Yusei attacks "Metal Skeleton" with "Shooting Star Dragon", destroying it and dropping Antinomy's Life Points to 1800. Yusei Sets a card in his Spell & Trap Card Zone and ends his turn.
 Antinomy says that while Yusei may have surpassed his own limits, he has only began to barely scratch the surface of the current situation, because as he regrets the limitations Yusei believes himself to have surpassed are not his true limitations. Yusei asks what he means by that and Antinomy replies that Accel Synchro Summons are meant as nothing more than an exhibit; A mere display of what lies beyond it. He says that he shall show Yusei and this is what lies far ahead and beyond of the surreal world of Yusei's.
 Antinomy begins his turn and both players SPC goes up to 4. He holds up " Tech Genus Gear Zombie " and explains that he reduce the ATK of a  Machine - Type  monster he controls to Special Summon it from his hand. The ATK of "Blade Blaster" drops to 2300 and "Gear Zombie" is Summoned. Next he Normal Summons " Tech Genus Drill Fish ". He tunes the Level 1 "Drill Fish" to the Level 1 "Gear Zombie" and recites  "Limiter removal, Level 2. Regulator, open. Navigation, all clear. Go! Synchro Summon! Come on, Tech Genus Recipro Dragonfly!" , as he Synchro Summons " Tech Genus Recipro Dragonfly ". The effect of "Recipro Dragonfly" lets him return a Synchro Monster to the  Extra Deck  and revive the Synchro Material Monsters used to Summon it, so he sends "Blade Blaster" to the Extra Deck and revives "Wonder Magician" and "Hyper Librarian".
 
         The tunnel.     
 Yusei is surprised that Antinomy returned his Accel Synchro Monster to his Extra Deck, but Antinomy explains that this is the answer to what lies beyond Accel Synchro Summoning. Antinomy speeds up and Yusei asks what he's about to do. Antinomy chants  "The state of supremacy beyond the limits of your own being, Top Clear Mind" . He enters a digital tunnel and tells Yusei to watch carefully.
 
         The star explodes.     
 Antinomy tunes his Level 2 "Recipro Dragonfly" and his Level 5 "Hyper Librarian" to his Level 5 "Wonder Magician" and recites  "Limiter removal, Level max. Regulator, open. All clear! Infinite power. Piercing through time and space, open to a world unknown. Go! Delta Accel!"  This causes the star they are riding next to to condenses, explodes and turns into a black hole. Antinomy finishes his chant  "Come on, Tech Genus Halberd Cannon"  as he  Delta Accel Synchro Summons  " Tech Genus Halberd Cannon ".
 
         The black hole.     
 Yusei observes the current state of the star and asks "What is...?" Antinomy asks if Yusei just saw that, a Synchro Summon using three Synchro Monsters. He says that this is a Synchro surpassing Accel Synchro and it is called Delta Accel Synchro.

He then tunes "Tech Genus Catapult Dragon" with "Tech Genus Jet Falcon in order to  Synchro Summon  " Tech Genus Hyper Librarian " ( 5/2400/1800) in Attack Position.

Yusei then activates "Speed Spell - Angel Baton" to draw two cards and send "Stardust Xiaolong" from his hand to the Graveyard. Yusei then Special Summons " Unknown Synchron " ( 1/0/0) from his hand in Attack Position as Antinomy had monsters on his side of the field while Yusei had none. 
 Yusei then  Tributes  "Unknown Synchron" in order to  Tribute Summon  " Salvage Warrior " ( 5/1900/1600) in Attack Position. Yusei then activates the effect of "Salvage Warrior" to revive "Junk Synchron" ( 3/1300/500) in Attack Position. Yusei then tunes "Salvage Warrior" with "Junk Synchron" in order to Synchro Summon " Stardust Dragon " ( 8/2500/2000) in Attack Position.
