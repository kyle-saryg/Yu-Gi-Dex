      The Nazca Lines.     
 The  Nazca Lines  are a series of  geoglyphs  located in the Nazca Desert in southern Peru. In the  Yu-Gi-Oh! 5D's  anime, they were formed after the  Earthbound Immortals  got sealed in the Earth.
 The seven lines associated with the Earthbound Immortals also appear on the right arms of the  Dark Signers  as  dark marks , with the exception of  Rex Goodwin , who had the condor mark on his back.

 History 
 The people of the Incan civilization of the  Stairway to the Dragon Star  were threatened by wicked disturbances in the earth. In response, the  Star Dragon King  prayed to the  Dragon Star  for help. The Dragon Star answered their prayers by sending the  Crimson Dragon , who, along with  five dragons , battled the evil incarnate Earthbound Immortals.
 The Dragons were able to seal the evil beings in the earth, but in the process, "Uru", the spider god managed to capture one of the Crimson Dragon's servants,  Ancient Fairy Dragon . After the battle, the evil gods were finally sealed within the earth, forming the Nazca Lines, with each line taking the shape of the Earthbound Immortal sealed within.
 
       The Spider lines disappearing.     
 Five thousand years later, as the  Dark Signers  continued their battle with the  Signers , the lines began disappearing as the corresponding Earthbound Immortals were summoned. Any time a Dark Signer engages in a  Shadow Duel , the corresponding geoglyph materializes around the field.
 Whenever the geoglyphs appear, tragedy is sure to follow. For example, when a Dark Signer summons an  Earthbound Immortal , casualties have occured not only within Satellite, but within  New Domino City  as well. This is because the Nazca Gods' summoning requires human sacrifices and those who have been sacrificed have ended up inside the geoglyphs. Because of this, hundreds of residents have disappeared from the city.
 After the battle against the Dark Signers ended in their defeat, the Immortals were re-sealed here and with this, the lines themselves once more reappeared.
 When Jack fought the  Familiar of Red Nova , the Red Nova geoglyph appeared. It then disappeared after the Duel.
 
 
 The real Nazca Lines 
 See:  Wikipedia:Nazca Lines . 
 In the real world, the Nazca Lines were created between 200 BC and 700 AD, by the Nazca people in Peru. They were made by manual labor and hundreds exist. Unlike in the anime, where the Nazca Lines are located in the highlands, the real ones are located in a desert near the coastline.
