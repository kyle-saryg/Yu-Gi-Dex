 Summary 
 Blister's house 
 Blister hides Yusei out from the  Sector Security  in a back-alley garage now decked out as a condo. He warns Yusei that the Securities will want to track him due to his altercation with  Trudge  that night. Yusei shrugs off the warnings as he stares into the wealthy districts of the city.
 
 Tops 
       Leo and Luna admire their repaired Disks.     
 At  Tops , Luna awakens to find her brother running insanely around the house, as he cannot find Yusei. She only succeeds in calming him down when she notices that Yusei has fixed their  Duel Disks  for them. Then, Leo gets a call from his friend,  Dexter . They make plans to go duel at the  Daimon Area  and hopefully meet up with a legendary duelist calling herself the " Black Rose Witch ." The two friends caution each other, as the Witch is said to kill those she defeats. At this point, Dexter notices Leo's Disk has been repaired. Luna stops him before he can reveal Yusei's identity, and tells him that, as Yusei is being pursued, they would not want to draw attention to him.
 
 Blister's house 
 As Yusei tinkers with his  Duel Runner , Blister asks him why Sector Security is so interested in him. Blister is certain that it's not just about the stolen Duel Runner. Yusei isn't sure, but he flings to Blister the photo  Lazar  used to blackmail him. Blister goes off to contact a friend who can help save Yusei's Satellite pals.
 
 Rex Goodwin's complex 
 At  Goodwin's  complex, he outlines his scheme to trap the  Signers  to  Jack , who dismisses it as preposterous. Goodwin, to involve Jack in participating, reveals that Yusei will be competing, thus giving Jack another shot at him. After Goodwin leaves, Jack confesses to  Mina  that he believes Goodwin is up to no good. He goes out to find Yusei, assuring Mina that he alone is powerful enough to control the  Crimson Dragon .
 
 Daimon Area 
       The three friends reunite.     
 The next day, a cab drops off  Tanner  and  Yanagi , free from prison, at Blister's place. The two enter to find Yusei noisily tinkering with the Runner. He greets them, and they take notice of his own Deck, which they have never seen before. Tanner challenges Yusei and the Duel gets underway. Before the first move can be made, a familiar white Duel Runner rides up, and Jack confronts Yusei. Yusei accuses Jack of ratting out their old friends, which Jack has no knowledge of. As a gesture of good faith, Jack returns " Stardust Dragon " and tells Yusei to face him in the tournament, putting Stardust Dragon on the line. Jack takes his leave, musing about how Yusei hasn't changed at all. Yanagi is thrilled to see Yusei has his precious card back, and discerns both that Yusei is a Signer and that Jack was the person he dueled the night they were captured.
 
 Iliaster chamber 
 In the  Iliaster  chamber, Goodwin assembles Lazar and five other members whom he calls the "Dueling Assassins". He sets the Assassins loose on the city.
 
 Daimon Area 
       The Daimon Area.     
 Yusei and his friends go to the Daimon Area to Duel. Among the duelists there, he spots Leo, who is asking around about the Black Rose Witch yet receiving little better results than harsh rebukes. Against his sister's advice, Leo introduces Yusei to Dexter, who is scared of Yusei's  criminal mark . Yusei's friends have heard of the Black Rose Witch - that she can make any card she plays real and that she "erases" those she defeats - but they dismiss her as an urban legend.
 As if on cue, the ground is torn up by a monstrous thornbush, and a massive dragon appears beyond the fog. The Witch appears in the fog and Yusei's birthmark starts to ache, as it had when he dueled Jack. Leo attempts to challenge the Witch, but the Witch notices Yusei's birthmark, which she condemns and yells "Wretched mark!". She then teleports away. She runs into an empty alley and ducks, breathing heavily, while atop a high scaffold, Lazar cackles to himself.
 
 Goodwin's plan 
         The  Fortune Cup  begins.     
 On the day of the Fortune Cup, Goodwin, from his box, watches the crowd file in. Lazar enters, and tells Goodwin that the Witch is a Signer and that she has received an invitation. As Jack watches with suspicion, Goodwin puts his plan into action.  "By the power of the Crimson Star, they shall all gather here..." 
 
         Iliaster's scheme takes shape.     
 
 Differences in adaptations 
 In the original, Leo states that he has had his Duel Disk "cusmatized". Luna tells him he was meant to say "customized". 
 In the English version, upon exiting the cab, Yanagi complains about his back. He does not say anything in the Japanese version. 
 In the English version, while Yusei was working on his Duel Runner, he was listening to  Hyper Drive . In the Japanese version he was not listening to music. 
 In the English version, Tanner challenges Yusei to a duel where if Tanner wins, he gets to try out Yusei's Duel Runner. In the original, Tanner simply wants to duel Yusei's true deck. 
 In the dub, there is a crowd that is watching  Jesse Wheeler ,  Joey Wheeler's  cousin dueling, as mentioned from someone in the crowd. In the Japanese version no one said it was Jesse Wheeler or mentioned Joey Wheeler. 
 In the dub the Black Rose is an urban legend, in the original everyone knows of her existence. 
 In the dub, when the Black Rose sees Yusei's birthmark she says, "You also have a mark!" and exclaims to Yusei to "Stay away from me!" In the original she only says "You too," and "wretched mark". 
 The English words "GOOD GOB!" on one of the signs in the scene that shows the pan over to Jack is replaced with the words "GOOD JOB!" in the English version. This is inconsistent with their usual text removals. 
 In the original, Jack did not make a bet over who gets to keep " Stardust Dragon " when giving it back to Yusei.
