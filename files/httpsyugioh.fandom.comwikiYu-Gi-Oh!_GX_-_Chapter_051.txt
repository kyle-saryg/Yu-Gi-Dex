 Aster Duels Again...! 
 
 "Masked Hero vs. Vision Hero!!" , known as  "Masked vs. Vision!!"  in the Japanese version, is the fifty-first chapter of the  Yu-Gi-Oh! GX  manga . It was first printed in Japanese in the  V Jump  magazine and in English in the  Shonen Jump  magazine. Both of which were printed in  volume 8  of the  Yu-Gi-Oh! GX  graphic novels afterwards.
 Jaden  continues his Duel with  Aster .
 
 Summary 
   This summary is currently incomplete. 
 Jaden  is excited to be  Dueling   Aster , as he knows the latter is a  Pro  Duelist in addition to being an American Academy student. The crowd is perplexed as to why Aster keeps Summoning monsters with low  ATK , with  Bastion  saying that the " Vision Hero " monsters reveal their true power when they move to the  Spell & Trap Card Zone . Jaden unveils the  Transformation Summoning  abilities of his " Masked Hero " monsters, which catches Aster off-guard. He had thought that participating in the tournament would be a breather from his Pro Dueling career, but admits he may have been mistaken.  Chazz  questions where Jaden's " Elemental Heroes " went and  Syrus  reveals that Jaden had recently gotten a desire to make a Deck all his own - without  Koyo 's help. Jaden looks to have won, but Aster avoids defeat with " Hero Soul " and strikes back with " Vision Hero Witch Raider " and " Vision Hero Adoration ", winning the Duel.
 
 Featured Duel: Jaden Yuki vs. Aster Phoenix 
 Duel continues from  the previous chapter .
 Turn 5: Aster 
 Aster   Normal Summons  " Vision Hero Increase " (900/1100) in  Attack Position . He  activates  the  effect  of the " Vision Hero Minimum Ray " in his  Spell & Trap Card Zone ,  Tributing  "Increase" to  Special Summon  "Minimum Ray" (1200/700) in Attack Position and  destroy   Jaden 's " Masked Hero Inferno ". "Minimum Ray"  attacks  and destroys " Masked Hero Bassols " (Jaden 4000 → 3800). Aster  Sets  a card.
 Turn 6: Jaden 
Jaden  draws  " Mask Change ". Jaden activates his  face-down  " Damaged Mask ", Special Summoning "Inferno" (1600/1000) from his  Graveyard  in Attack Position, though it will be destroyed during the  End Phase . Aster activates his face-down " Fiendish Trap Hole " in an attempt to destroy "Inferno", but Jaden activates his "Mask Change"  Quick-Play Spell Card  from his  hand ,  sending  "Inferno" to the Graveyard to  Transformation Summon  a "Masked Hero" monster from his  Extra Deck  with the same  Level  +2 — " Masked Hero Goka " (2200/1800). It gains 100  ATK  for each " Hero " monster in Jaden's Graveyard, so its ATK becomes 2400. Jaden Sets a card and attacks "Increase" with "Goka". Aster activates his face-down " Mirror Force ", which would destroy all Attack Position monsters that Jaden  controls , but Jaden activates his face-down " Form Change ", returning "Goka" to the Extra Deck and Special Summoning a "Masked Hero" of the same Level from it — " Masked Hero Vapor ". Its effect prevents its destruction by card effects, so "Mirror Force"  resolves  with no effect. "Vapor" attacks and destroys "Minimum Ray" (Aster 3000 → 1800). As he has taken damage, Aster moves the " Vision Hero Multiply Guy " and "Vision Hero Increase" in his Graveyard to his Spell & Trap Card Zone. Jaden Sets a card.
 Turn 7: Aster 
Aster draws " Vision Fusion ". He Normal Summons " Vision Hero Poisoner " (900/700) in  Defense Position  and Sets a card.
 Turn 8: Jaden 
Jaden Normal Summons " Masked Hero Dusk Crow " (1200/1000) in Attack Position, who attacks and destroys "Poisoner". "Vapor" attacks  directly  (Aster 1800 → 0), but Aster activates his face-down " Hero Soul ", allowing him to immediately gain 100 Life Points as a "Hero" monster he controls was  destroyed by battle  this  turn  (Aster 0 → 100). As he has taken damage, Aster moves the "Minimum Ray" in his Graveyard to his Spell & Trap Card Zone.
 Turn 9: Aster 
Aster draws " Vision Hero Witch Raider " and activates " Vision Release ", Special Summoning "Increase" (900/1100) from his Spell & Trap Card Zone. The effect of "Increase" activates, letting Aster Special Summon a "Hero" monster from his  Deck . He Special Summons another "Increase" (900/1100). He Tributes both monsters to Normal Summon "Witch Raider" (2700/1900) in Attack Position. Its effect activates, destroying Jaden's face-down " Negate Attack ". Aster activates "Vision Fusion", fusing the "Minimum Ray" and "Multiply Guy" in his Spell & Trap Card Zone to  Fusion Summon  " Vision Hero Adoration " (2700/2100) in Attack Position. Its effect activates, reducing the ATK and DEF of "Vapor" by that of "Witch Raider". It now has 0 ATK and 100 DEF. "Witch Raider" attacks and destroys "Dusk Crow" (Jaden 3800 → 2300), while "Adoration" attacks and destroys "Vapor" (Jaden 2300 → 0).
