      Kul Elna before its destruction     
 Kul Elna  (クル・エルナ)  was a village where  Aknadin  created the 7  Millennium Items , through the sacrifice of 99 human souls.
 Kul Elna was once a village of thieves and criminals, and was chosen by  Aknadin  for that very reason. The requirements of the Dark Spell necessary to forge the  Millennium Items  included the sacrifice of 99 human souls, so Aknadin chose the darkest place in the Kingdom of Egypt in order to give power to the Items. [1]  In the process, all the village's inhabitants were sacrificed and the village destroyed, with Aknadin apparently the only one who knew the village's location.
 There was, however, one survivor among Kul Elna's population:  Thief King Bakura . The process would also result in the creation of  Diabound , created by the extinct villagers' desire for revenge. Bakura would, fittingly, control it in order to avenge his slaughtered villagers.
 At some point after  Pharaoh Atem  sealed his soul inside of the  Millennium Pendant , the spirits seemingly left Kul Elna.
 In the  Yu-Gi-Oh! GX  manga ,  Tragoedia  is also another survivor of Kul Elna, as he was not at the village at the time of the attack. However, after learning about the massacre that decimated his village, his hatred and anger led to the creation of an extremely corrupted and powerful ka, that being Tragoedia.
 In the  Yu-Gi-Oh! manga ,  Bakura  states that the sacrificed spirits went to  Hell , and that he could hear their grudge in said afterlife from the Millennium Items.
 
 Dawn of the Duel events 
       Kul Elna many years after its destruction, as it appears when visited by Pharaoh Atem in search of Thief King Bakura ( Ep.209 )     
 In the  Dawn of the Duel  ( Millennium World ) story arc, Bakura blames  Atem's  father,  Aknamkanon , for destroying his village. The evil in his heart was so great the  Sacred Guardians  could not contain the beast inside. Later on, Pharaoh Atem confronts Bakura at Kul Elna in the hope of retrieving the Millennium Items he stole. [2]  Bakura summons forth the spirits of Kul Elna to protect his monster " Diabound ", and attempts to destroy Atem by sending the inhabitants' spirits into his body. However,  Mahad  appears as " Dark Magician ", managing to protect the Pharaoh and destroy Bakura's Diabound with the help of  Mana  and " Dark Magician Girl ". 
 However, Aknadin comes in and freezes them in time (which was really  Yami Bakura  using his ability to control the "Sands of Time"). Aknadin then puts all seven Millennium items in the Millennium Stone, bringing forth the soul of  Zorc Necrophades , who rewards him by transforming him into the " Shadow Magus ".
 
 Origin 
 Kul Elna might have been based on the real-world location "el-Qurna" (القرنة), which was considered as a village of grave robbers in the past. The village itself lay on the foot of the Thebani mountains, near the Theban Necropolis.
 It is also likely that Kul Elna is connected to the ancient city of Set Ma'at, or "Deir el-Medina" (دير المدينة‎), which was a city of "grave robbers descended from the royal tomb builders," just like Kul Elna was  [3] .
