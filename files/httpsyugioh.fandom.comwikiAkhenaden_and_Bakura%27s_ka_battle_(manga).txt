 Priest Akhenaden  and  Bakura, King of Thieves  faced each other in a  ka battle  at the  Shrine of Wedju , in the  Yu-Gi-Oh!  manga .  A similar version  of this battle takes place in the  anime .
 As part of his crusade to collect the  Millennium Items , Bakura targeted Akhenaden, but rather than kill him and take his  Millennium Eye , he decided to corrupt Akhenaden with evil, in revenge for the  Kul Elna massacre .
 
 Events 
       Bakura , hidden by  Diabound 's camouflage     
 Having acquired the  Millennium Ring  from  his battle  with  Mahado , Bakura's ka,  Diabound  gained the ability to blend into its surroundings. Hiding under the cover of Diabound's camouflaged snake appendage, Bakura walked past the security outside the  pharaoh's palace  and made his way to the Shrine of Wedju. [1] 
 Inside the shrine, Bakura confronted Akhenaden, revealing he had survived the battle with Mahado and taken the ring and reiterated his intentions to take the other  Millennium Items . [1] 
 Akhenaden attempted to summon a dragon from one of the tablets in the shrine, but Diabound, camouflaged against the walls, smashed the tablet before the ka could materialize. Bakura warned Akhenaden that Diabound could tear the temple apart, before he would be able to summon a single ka. [1] 
 Using the power he gained from the Millennium Ring, Bakura raised Akhenaden into the air without touching him and flung him against one of the tablets. Contemplating whether or not to kill Akhenaden, he said he would set Akhenaden decide. [1]  Killing Akhenaden and taking his  Millennium Eye  would be easy, Bakura thought, but also considered that he could make Akhenaden work for him. He explained that the Millennium Ring allowed him to infuse parts of his soul into objects and that he could make Akhenaden his pawn by sealing some of his evil into the Millennium Eye. [2] 
 
       Akhenaden , after Bakura tampered with the  Millennium Eye     
 Akhenaden refused to become Bakura's pawn and attempted to summon another ka. As it began to materialize, Diabound easily destroyed it. [2] 
 Bakura felt killing Akhenaden would not be sufficient enough to make up for the  Kul Elna massacre  he conducted. Bakura identified himself as the sole survivor of the massacre. As revenge, he decided he would have Akhenaden spill the blood of his own kingdom, as the ruler of shadows. Bakura tampered with the Millennium Eye, infusing it with his evil and bloodying Akhenaden's eye socket in the process. [2] 
 Bakura fled the shrine, leaving Akhenaden's unconscious body behind. Bakura was spotted leaving the palace, prompting  another battle  between him,  Atem  and the  High Priests .  Kalim ,  Shada  and  Seto  tended to Akhenaden's body. Seeing his bloodied eye socket, they assumed Bakura had attempted to steal the Millennium Eye, but left without it. [2]
