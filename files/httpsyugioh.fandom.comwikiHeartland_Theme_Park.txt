The  Heartland Theme Park  is the amusement park from  Heartland , whose director is  Mr. Heartland . It is a very popular park in the  Yu-Gi-Oh ZEXAL manga , and contains many attractions that attract people from many different places. Because of that,  Dr. Faker  "provided" 3  Numbers Hunters  to hunt " Numbers " secretly inside the park, disguised as employees. They are  Captain Corn ,  Thunder Spark  and  Cologne , who got known as the "mascots of the park". Mr. Heartland also allowed  Duelists  to enter the park for free, to make the hunt for "Numbers" easier.
 After Mr. Heartland's probable death,  Kyoji  created a duplicate of him made with spiders and took advantage of the theme park. He arranged a double  Duel  involving the  Number Hunters , which was held in the park's newest attraction - the  Heartland New Tower .
