      The  Kaiba Craft 3     
 The  Kaiba Craft 3 , known as the  Battle Ship  in the manga and Japanese version, is the blimp, where the  Battle City  quarter finals took place.
 On the way to the semi-finals,  Noah Kaiba  and the Big Five forced them to land in his water fortress, thus sending them to the digital world. After escaping the digital world,  Gozaburo Kaiba  tries to stop them from escaping the water fortress. The blimp skin was torn off, revealing it was actually a jet made to look like a blimp. It successfully escaped.
 After the  Battle City Finals , the duelists had to leave the blimp since it wasn't working and the island of which the final duels were held was going to self-destruct in less than 30 minutes. It was last seen sinking under the ocean when the island self-destructed.
 The appearance of the blimp was altered in the English version by digitizing out the "DUEL DISK" words written on the side.
