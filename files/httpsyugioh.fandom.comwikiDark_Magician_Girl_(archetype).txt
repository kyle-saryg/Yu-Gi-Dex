 " Dark Magician Girl ", known as " Black Magician Girl " (ブラック・マジシャン・ガール  Burakku Majishan Gāru ) in Japan, is an extensive  archetype —being sub-archetype of the " Dark Magician " archetype and having a sub-archetype of its own in the " Magician Girl " archetype while remaining a distinct archetype in and of itself. They are all based on " Dark Magician Girl ". It is only supported by the  Spell Card  " Dark Burning Attack ".
 In French and German, the effect of " The Eye of Timaeus " supports this archetype under the name "Magicienne des Ténèbres" and „Dunkles Magier“, respectively, due to the gendered nature of the languages causing the term "Dark Magician" to differ between " Dark Magician " („Dunkler Magier“) and " Dark Magician Girl " („Dunkles Magier-Mädchen“). This German name for the archetype differs from the German name used on the card "Dark Burning Attack".
 In Portuguese and Spanish, the effect of " The Eye of Timaeus " supports "Mago(a) Negro(a)" and "Mago/a Oscuro/a", respectively, which includes both the name of " Dark Magician " ("Mago Negro", "Mago Oscuro") and part of the name of "Dark Magician Girl" ("Pequena Maga Negra", "Chica Maga Oscura") in that language. In Italian, despite the term for "Dark Magician" differing between "Dark Magician" ("Mago Nero") and "Dark Magician Girl" ("Ragazza Maga Nera"), only the former is supported.
