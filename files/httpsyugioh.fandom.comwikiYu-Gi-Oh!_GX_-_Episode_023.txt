 Jaden Yuki  is forced to Duel  Belowski , a former  Obelisk Blue  student who was isolated from the rest of  Duel Academy  due to his strange powers.  Dr. Crowler  hopes that Belowski's powers will rid Jaden of his motivation to Duel, thus disallowing him from participating in the Duel against  North Academy 's representative.

 Summary 
 Dr. Crowler  is unable to accept that  Jaden Yuki  has officially been declared  Duel Academy 's representative against  North Academy . However, he states he still has a last resort to stop this from taking place. He arrives at a chicken coop in a fenced area deep in the forests surrounding the school, and is immediately assaulted by chickens. Also in the fence is a sandbox, which he runs to, uncovering a secret hatchway beneath the sand. He manages to enter it, but due to the chickens still attacking him, he falls in, rather than being able to use the ladder. Eventually he detaches himself from the chickens. He dons a strange astronaut-like suit, and a bridge extends outward to let him enter a large sphere after scanning a card key.
 Jaden is sitting in class, attempting to rebuild his Deck, and is unable to decide what to take out.  Alexis Rhodes ,  Syrus Truesdale ,  Bastion Misawa  and  Chumley Huffington  approach him, and all ask him to put their cards into his Deck - " Etoile Cyber ", " Power Bond ", " Water Dragon " and " Des Koala ", respectively. He declines, but they will not leave him alone. He runs, and manages to lose them by rounding a corner. He wants to rebuild his Deck in peace, and ends up on Duel Academy's roof. However, he finds he's not alone, and meets a short student dressed in a tattered  Obelisk Blue  uniform and sandals, who introduces himself as  Belowski .  Winged Kuriboh  appears, and Belowski reveals that he can also see spirits. Belowski challenges him to a Duel, stating that he has always wanted to duel someone that can see spirits. Jaden's friends arrive, while Crowler watches the Duel from atop one of the pillars, still dressed in his strange suit. The Duel begins. Belowski Summons " Mokey Mokey " in  Defense Position , with all of Jaden's friends remarking how cute it is while Chumley yawns, beginning to feel sleepy. Belowski  Sets  two cards to end his turn. Jaden Summons " Elemental HERO Sparkman " in  Attack Position  and then plays " Polymerization ",  fusing  the " Elemental HERO Avian " and " Elemental HERO Burstinatrix " in his  hand  to  Fusion Summon  " Elemental Hero Flame Wingman " in Attack Position.
 Jaden attacks with "Sparkman",  destroying  "Mokey Mokey". Belowski  activates  his  face-down  " Human-Wave Tactics ", which will let him  Special Summon  the same number of  Level  2 or lower  Normal Monsters  were destroyed during each turn during that turn's  End Phase . Jaden attacks  directly  with "Flame Wingman", ending his turn. "Human-Wave Tactics" lets Belowski Special Summon " Happy Lover " in Attack Position, and he then Summons another "Mokey Mokey" in Attack Position as well. He activates " Mokey Mokey Smackdown " and then attacks "Sparkman" with "Happy Lover", destroying his own monster. "Mokey Mokey" turns bright red, and Belowski explains that if a  Fairy - type  monster is  destroyed in battle , "Mokey Mokey Smackdown" will raise the  ATK  of all "Mokey Moke]s" on the  field  to 3000 for the duration of the turn. "Mokey Mokey" destroys "Flame Wingman". Belowski activates " Mystic Wok " to  Tribute  "Mokey Mokey" and add its ATK to his  LP , thus recovering all the damage he had to take to set up his combo and increasing his LP to 4100. He ends his turn, and "Human-Wave Tactics" lets him Special Summon " Haniwa " since "Happy Lover" was destroyed. Jaden's friends urge him to relax and stop fighting, and by this point, Chumley has been affected enough by Belowski's strange powers to fall unconscious.
 Crowler reveals himself, jumping down from the pillar that he was hiding on. He explains that three years ago, Belowski was Duel Academy's top Duelist. A series of short flashbacks of Belowski's previous Duels are shown. Crowler explains that, eventually, Belowski's opponents began to lose their motivation, and they all dropped out of the Academy. Belowski states that he has no idea why it happens, but it always does after he uses "Mokey Mokey". In order to protect the Academy's students, Belowski was isolated within his own dorm, which included a virtual paradise. The Duel continues, and Jaden Summons " Elemental HERO Wildheart ", which he uses to destroy "Haniwa". "Sparkman" attacks directly. Jaden Sets a card to end his turn. "Human-Wave Tactics" lets Belowski Summon another "Happy Lover" in Attack Position. Crowler questions why all of Jaden's motivation is still present, while his friends have all fallen asleep. Belowski ignores him, and plays " Pot of Greed ",  drawing  two cards. He then plays " Dark Factory of Mass Production ", adding the two "Mokey Mokeys" in his  Graveyard  to his hand. He fuses them with the third "Mokey Mokey" in his hand using "Polymerization" to Fusion Summon " Mokey Mokey King ", which appears floating next to the Academy, taking up an absurd amount of space. However, it still has only 300 ATK, but Belowski attacks "Wildheart" anyway. "Mokey Mokey King" is destroyed, but its effect Special Summons all three "Mokey Mokeys" from the Graveyard.
 
       Belowski's effect on Jaden's friends.     
 "Happy Lover" attacks "Wildheart", destroying itself, but this increases the ATK of all three "Mokey Mokeys" to 3000 via "Mokey Mokey Smackdown". The first "Mokey Mokey" destroys "Wildheart", and Jaden protects "Sparkman" from the second "Mokey Mokey" by activating his face-down " Hero Barrier ",  negating  the attack. The third "Mokey Mokey" attacks and destroys "Sparkman" afterwards. Belowski ends his turn, with "Human-Wave Tactics" letting him Summon another "Happy Lover" in Defense Position. He then activates his face-down " Gift of The Mystical Elf ", gaining 300 LP for each monster on the field, bringing his LP back up to 1800. Jaden Summons " Elemental HERO Bubbleman ", drawing two cards. He then plays " Hero Heart ", which lets "Bubbleman" attack twice if Jaden halves its ATK. He uses the first attack on a "Mokey Mokey", which increases the attack points of the other two to 3000 via "Mokey Mokey Smackdown". Despite this, he attacks another "Mokey Mokey". He plays the  Quick-Play Spell Card  " Bubble Illusion ", which lets him activate a  Trap Card  from his hand when "Bubbleman" is on the field. He chooses " Mirror Gate ", which switches control of the two battling monsters. "Mokey Mokey" destroys "Bubbleman" reducing Belowski's LP to 0. Belowski theorizes that his powers did not affect Jaden because he loves Dueling far too much. After this, Belowski falls alseep and Jaden attempts to wake up his friends by offering to use the cards they offered him earlier, but that fails.

 Turn 6: Jaden 
Jaden draws " Elemental HERO Bubbleman " and subsequently Normal Summons it (800/1200) in Attack Position. Since Jaden summoned "Bubbleman" while he had no other cards on his side of the field, its second effect activates, allowing Jaden to draw two cards. Jaden then activates " Hero Heart " to halve the ATK of "Bubbleman" ("Bubbleman": 800 → 400 ATK) until the End Phase and allow it to attack twice during this turn's Battle Phase.
 "Bubbleman" attacks and destroys "Mokey Mokey" (Belowski: 1800 → 1700 LP). The effect of "Mokey Mokey Smackdown" activates (two remaining "Mokey Mokey": 300 → 3000 ATK). "Bubbleman" attacks another "Mokey Mokey".

 Differences in adaptations 
 In the Japanese version,  Cronos  refers to letting  Motegi  out as "opening  Pandora's Box ", but that doing so will give him hope as that is always the last thing left in Pandora's Box. 
 In the English version, Belowski's character, as well as the episode name, are references to the movie  The Big Lebowski . 
 The English version cuts most of the flashbacks to Belowski's Duels, and instead only shows the final scene of them. 
 The English version cuts a flashback Syrus has about Jaden's duel with Bastion.
