 Battle  (Japanese:  戦 闘   Sentō ; Verb:  戦 闘 を 行 う  Sentō o okonau ) is an interaction which  monsters  can undergo during the  Battle Phase . A monster battles when it  Attacks , be it  Direct Attack  or against an opponent monster. A monster also battle if it is targeted for an attack.
 A monster does not battle if the attack is  negated  or cancelled due to a  Replay .
 
 Battle Outcome 
 Direct Attack 
 When a player is attacked directly, that player takes  battle damage  equal to that monster's ATK during  damage calculation .
 
 Monsters' battle 
 When two monsters battle, the following occurs during  damage calculation .
 
 If the  attack target  is in  Attack Position :
 If the monsters have different ATK, the monster with the lower ATK is  destroyed by battle , also its controller takes battle damage equal to the difference. 
 If the monsters have the same nonzero ATK, they are both destroyed by battle, but neither player takes any battle damage. 
 If the monsters both have 0 ATK, neither monster is destroyed by battle and neither player takes any battle damage. 
 If the attack target is in  Defense Position :
 If the attack target's DEF is lower than the attacker's ATK, the attack target is destroyed by battle, but neither player takes any battle damage unless the attacking monster inflicts  piercing  battle damage. 
 If the attack target's DEF is greater than the attacker's ATK, the attacking monster's controller takes battle damage equal to the difference, but neither monster is destroyed by battle. 
 If the attack target's DEF is equal to the attacker's ATK, neither monster is destroyed by battle and neither player takes any battle damage.
