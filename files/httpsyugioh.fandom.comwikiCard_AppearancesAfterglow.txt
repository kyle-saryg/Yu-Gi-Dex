 Yu-Gi-Oh! 5D's 
 In  episode 146 ,  Aporia  draws this card during his Ground Duel against  Z-one . After he draws this card, Aporia notes that as long as he has this card, he can still fight. Aporia notes that this card is a card of hope that will bring forth a miracle. In  the next episode , Aporia activates this card after he empties out his Deck, allowing Aporia to place this card into his Deck. Aporia explains to Z-one once he draws this card, he can reveal it to inflict 4000 damage to Z-one and win, and by emptying his deck before hand he's guaranteed to draw "Afterglow" again. Z-one sabotages Aporia's plan by using " Lazion, the Timelord ", after it attacks directly, the effect of "Lazion" forces Aporia to return every card in his Graveyard to his Deck. Z-one explains that due to the effect of "Lazion", Aporia will take 1000 damage when he draws a card during his Draw Phase, so if Aporia doesn't draw this card, he will lose the Duel, and that his chances of succeeding is 1/34. Aporia conducts his Draw Phase, but he draws " Meklord Emperor Granel " instead of this card. As a result of this, the effect of "Lazion" inflicts 1000 damage to Aporia and he loses the Duel.
