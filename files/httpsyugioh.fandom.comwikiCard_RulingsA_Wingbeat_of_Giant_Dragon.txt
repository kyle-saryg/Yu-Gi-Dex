 TCG Rulings 
 Judge Program Forum Rulings 
   These Ruling(s) have not  been confirmed as applicable to the TCG. [Notes 1] 
 If  A Wingbeat of Giant Dragon  is activated and  Book of Moon  is chained, flipping the only  Level  5 or higher  Dragon - Type  monster on the controller's side of the field  face-down , then  A Wingbeat of Giant Dragon  resolves without effect.
 Since the entire effect of  A Wingbeat of Giant Dragon  happens during resolution, the controller of the effect must be able to return a Level 5 or higher Dragon-Type monster from the field to the hand during resolution of the effect. A face-down monster's Level and Type cannot be determined, so it cannot be returned for the effect. Without returning an appropriate monster, the effect of  A Wingbeat of Giant Dragon  cannot continue to resolve as the conjunction "and if you do" is used, so the effect of  A Wingbeat of Giant Dragon  resolves without effect. [1] 
 OCG Rulings

[3] 
 Even if you only control a Level 5 or higher " Horus the Black Flame Dragon LV6 ", you can activate " A Wingbeat of Giant Dragon ". Also, you can choose to return " Horus the Black Flame Dragon LV6 " to the  hand  by the effect of " A Wingbeat of Giant Dragon ", but since it's unaffected by  Spell Cards , it does not return to the  hand , and the  " destroy  all  Spell  and  Trap Cards  on the  field ."  effect is not applied. [4] 
 A  Fusion ,  Synchro  or  Xyz Monster  can be chosen by the effect of " A Wingbeat of Giant Dragon ".  [ sic ]  Also, the chosen monster isn't returned to the  hand  and is returned to the  Extra Deck  instead. Furthermore, if a  Fusion Monster  is chosen by the effect of " A Wingbeat of Giant Dragon " and the chosen monster isn't returned to the  hand , the  " destroy  all  Spell  and  Trap Cards  on the  field ."  effect is not applied.

 Previously Official Rulings 
   These TCG rulings were issued by  Upper Deck Entertainment  and have since been deemed unofficial by Konami. [6]  They were previously considered official and can still be correct, as long as they follow the official gameplay rules, or unless Konami has issued a ruling that says otherwise.
