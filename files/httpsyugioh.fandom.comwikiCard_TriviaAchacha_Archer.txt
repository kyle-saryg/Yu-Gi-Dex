 This card's name comes from the Japanese sound effect used in anime and manga, "acha", which is used to represent remorse. 
 The sound effect of "acha" can also sound like someone being burned.
 In the anime, when this monster uses its effect to inflict burn damage, its hands become burned from the arrow, and its eyes grow wider as it screams its name. 
 "Achacha" is also the name of an orange-colored   tropical fruit . 
 This monster appears in the artwork of " United Front ".
