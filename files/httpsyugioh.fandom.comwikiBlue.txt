 Blue  (ブルー  Burū ) is a character in the  Toei  Yu-Gi-Oh!  anime . Her role in the series replaces that of " name unknown " from the  manga .
 Blue, along with  Red  and  Black  were three people at  Kaiba Land , hired by  Seto Kaiba  to play the  Stardust Shootout  game against  Yugi Mutou  and his friends.
 Kaiba rigged the game so that the players on his team had real lasers that caused fatal electric shocks when fired while Yugi and his friends were given toy guns. Yugi,  Hiroto Honda ,  Katsuya Jonouchi ,  Anzu Mazaki , and  Miho Nosaka ) participated in the game. Miho's timidity led to the downfall of the three  KaibaCorp  employees.
 
 Trivia 
 Although it may be a coincidence, in the 1988 OVA  Violence Jack: Evil Town  there's a blonde-haired, blue-eyed male-to-female transsexual, named Blue. Blue was a villain in both the anime and manga of  Violence Jack , who killed several characters with ease. The  Yu-Gi-Oh!  franchise has had many similarities to other works by Go Nagai, the author of  Violence Jack .
