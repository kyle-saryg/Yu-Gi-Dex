 5 silhouettes of  Ai  connecting with each other through their arms and feet, forming a "wall", appear in this card's artwork. 
 The cost of this card's activation (targeting a  FIRE  monster) implies that this card works like a  firewall  (restricting actions from outside to inside and vice-versa). 
 Because of this card's ability to cease battling among players, this card's name may come from "aiai" (藹々), which can mean "peaceful" or "harmonious."
