 Mushara  is one of the two men hired to help  Solomon Muto  through the Pharaoh's tomb. 
 In Egypt, he and his brother  Ahmet  were hired by Solomon Muto to infiltrate the tomb of the nameless Pharaoh. In the tomb, Solomon soon realized that the traps were like a game. Multiple statues armed with swords slide by on the high catwalk. To cross, a person needed to walk across with their left foot forward, and if they ran on both legs, the statues would kill them. Unfortunately, the two brothers are right footed. Ahmet makes it to safety, while his brother panicked and started running. The statues soon stabbed Mushara with a sword, causing him to fall to his death. (In the English dub, he fell into a Shadow Pit and became trapped in the  Shadow Realm .)
