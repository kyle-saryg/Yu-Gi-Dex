This article is about the value. For other uses, see  Infinity (disambiguation) .      
 ∞  is the symbol for  infinity , which has been used in a few exceptionally rare cases in the anime and manga as a  monster 's  ATK  or  DEF  value.
 Strictly speaking, ∞ is not actually a number, but rather the concept of a value greater than any number. A monster with ∞ ATK cannot be destroyed by battle unless it battles another monster that also has ∞ ATK (and both are in  Attack Position ), in which case the two would destroy each other in a  Double KO . If a monster with ∞ ATK attacked another Attack Position monster with non-infinite ATK, the controller of the latter would take an infinite amount of  battle damage , instantly dropping their  Life Points  to 0.
 
 Anime 
 One of the effects of " Obelisk the Tormentor " is to increase its ATK to ∞ by  Tributing  2 monsters. This was shown on-screen a total of three times in the anime:
 In  episode 139 ,  Yami Yugi  used " Soul Taker " to Tribute  Yami Marik 's " Egyptian God Slime " for the effect of "Obelisk". By  Battle City  mechanics, "Slime" was able to count as two Tributes since it was a  Fusion Monster  made of two Fusion Materials. The ATK of "Obelisk" then became ∞, and Yami Yugi attempted to  destroy  Yami Marik's " The Winged Dragon of Ra " by battle to win the Duel. However, Yami Marik negated the attack with " Class System ". 
 Twice in  Yu-Gi-Oh! The Pyramid of Light ,  Yami Yugi  Tributed " Slifer the Sky Dragon " and "The Winged Dragon of Ra" to make the ATK of "Obelisk" ∞. The first time, it was used to destroy  Kaiba 's " Blue-Eyes Ultimate Dragon ", inflicting an infinite amount of battle damage to Kaiba and causing him to lose the Duel. The second time, it was used to destroy  Anubis 's " Theinen the Great Sphinx " with the same result. 
 " Divine Serpent Geh " has an ATK of ∞. In  episode 181 ,  Dartz  used this monster to destroy Yami Yugi's " Legendary Knight Timaeus ", inflicting an infinite amount of battle damage to him and dropping his Life Points to 0. However, Yami Yugi activated " Relay Soul " to Special Summon " Dark Magician Girl " and be able to continue the Duel until she was destroyed. 
 In  episode 182 , Yami Yugi used the effects of " Legendary Knight Critias " and " Legendary Knight Hermos " to form an  infinite loop  where the ATK of "Hermos" would be continuously multiplied. By anime mechanics, this caused the ATK of "Hermos" to become ∞. He then used the effect of " Legendary Knight Timaeus ", absorbing "Critias" and "Hermos" to Summon " Timaeus the Knight of Destiny ". Since "Knight of Destiny's" ATK is equal to the combined ATK of the absorbed monsters, its ATK became ∞ as well. It then battled Dartz's "Divine Serpent Geh", destroying both monsters in a Double KO. (The effect of "Knight of Destiny" then Special Summoned the 3 "Legendary Knights" back to the field.) 
 Manga 
 At one point when the five pieces of " Exodia " were gathered, the complete "Exodia" was shown as a monster with an ATK of ∞, representing "Exodia's"  automatic victory condition . 
 In  Yu-Gi-Oh! R - Duel Round 042 ,  Dark Yugi  used the effect of "Obelisk the Tormentor" to increase its ATK to ∞. However, his opponent,  Yako Tenma , controlled " The Wicked Avatar ", whose effect would make its own ATK and DEF equal to that of the strongest monster on the field + 1. This caused the ATK and DEF of "The Wicked Avatar" to become ∞ as well. True to actual math, the two ATK values were treated as equal to each other (∞ + 1 = ∞ and is not greater than ∞), and the two monsters were later able to destroy each other in battle in a  Double KO . 
 Trivia 
 No monster with ∞ ATK or DEF has ever been seen in  Defense Position . 
 There has not yet been an instance in the anime or manga where a player has achieved an infinite number of Life Points, although it would be theoretically possible by simply activating a card such as " Mystik Wok " on a monster with ∞ ATK or DEF.
 It is unclear what would happen if a player with ∞ Life Points were to take ∞ damage (by a  direct attack  or otherwise), as ∞ subtracted from itself is an  indeterminate  value (for example, any number would be correct, as any number can be added to ∞ to yield ∞). 
 Technically speaking, Yami Yugi's maneuver with "Legendary Knight Hermos"  would  have yielded an ATK greater than ∞, if ∞ has its usual meaning of the  smallest possible infinity . In math, it can be proven that adding or multiplying ∞ by any number (even multiplying ∞ by itself) yields  a value equal to ∞ , but multiplying a number (in this case, 2800) by another number (in this case, 3) an infinite number of times yields  a value strictly greater than ∞ . However, this subtlety is not properly picked up on in the anime, as Yami Yugi states that the ATK of "Legendary Knight Hermos" is ∞, and "Timaeus the Knight of Destiny" is destroyed by battle.
 Presumably, a maneuver like this would be the only way to destroy a Defense Position monster with ∞ DEF by battle, by getting a monster whose ATK is higher than that DEF.
