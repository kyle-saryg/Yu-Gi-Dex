 Summary 
 Eviluder  declares the launch of his " No. 42: Starship Galaxy Tomahawk ", which appears in the sky, covering the buildings.  Astral  is shocked at its 3000  DEF , but  Yuma  tells him not to worry, since  Duels  aren't about  monster  size, and its in  Defense Position . Eviluder smirks, and tells Yuma he still doesn't know the terror of his fleet, as he  activates  the  effect  of "Starship Galaxy Tomahawk",  detaching  an  Xyz Material  to  Special Summon  4 " Battle Eagle Tokens " to his  field .  Tokunosuke  is shocked at his Summoning 4 monsters at once, but  Takashi  and  Kotori  say they've got less  ATK  than Yuma's " No. 39: Utopia ", so they can't  attack . Eviluder smirks again, and declares the "operation" is just beginning, as he activates " Covering Fire , increasing the ATK of all his tokens to 2500.  Cathy  notes they've now got the same attack as "Utopia", while  Luna  comments Eviluder is a powerful " Numbers " user, seeing his four 2500 ATK monsters. Eviluder orders all units of the "Battle Eagle Squadron" to open fire.
 
         " Battle Eagle Token  I" locks " No. 39: Utopia " as the  Attack target .     
 "Battle Eagle I" locks its  target  as "Utopia", and fires a wave of missiles towards him, but Yuma protects "Utopia" with his effect,  Moon Barrier . Eviluder orders "Battle Eagle II" to open fire, while Yuma protects "Utopia" with its effect again. Eviluder then orders "Battle Eagle III" to attack, destroying both itself and "Utopia", as the latter ran out of Xyz Materials. Astral is worried about Eviluder's overwhelming the defenses of "Utopia", as "Battle Eagle IV" launches a missile towards Yuma, which explodes and sends him to the ground. Eviluder then orders all "Battle Eagle Units" to return to the base, as the tokens go back to "Starship Galaxy Tomahawk", and  Sets  2 cards.
 
         Yuma  gathers the " Gagaga " duo and matches their  Levels .     
 Astral asks Yuma if he's alright, as his  Life Points  marker goes down to 1500. Yuma affirms, saying that Eviluder just took a huge chunk of his Life. He also wonders if that's what he did to  Tetsuo  - a concentrated attack, as he looks to the wound the missile caused on him. Astral comments "Starship Galaxy Tomahawk" is a powerful  Xyz Monster , and that's it is a nuisance. He also says that since no monsters are left in  Attack Position , they'd have to take down that mother ship. Yuma replies by saying that it's got a DEF of 3000, and that even if they brought "Utopia" back, he's only got an ATK of 2500. However, Astral says there's still a way, and Yuma notes the " Gagaga Girl " in his  hand . Yuma says he got it - he's going to use the effect of "Gagaga Girl", but Astral says that although by  Xyz Summoning  with "Gagaga Girl" they can reduce the ATK of an enemy to 0, there's no point on doing that of "Starship Galaxy Tomahawk", as it is in Defense Position. Yuma agrees, but Astral says he's right on using the effect of "Gagaga Girl", and tells Yuma to think hard - their  Deck  holds one monster whose ATK surpasses the DEF of "Starship Galaxy Tomahawk". Yuma notes who it is, and declares that settles it, as he  draws .
 
         " Tomahawk Cannon " charges before smashing " No. 22: Zombiestein ".     
 Yuma Summons "Gagaga Girl" in Attack Position, who's scared seeing the size of "Starship Galaxy Tomahawk". Eviluder declares an ATK of 1000 is a suicide attack, and that he would bombard Yuma to smithereens. However, Yuma misunderstands what he said, and says there's nothing wrong with his "bum". Yuma activates " Gagaga Academy Emergency Network ", Special Summoning " Gagaga Magician ". Tokunosuke says there it is - a " Gagaga " upperclassman. Yuma uses the effects of his "Gagaga" monsters to make both  Level  8, and Overlays them to Xyz Summon " No. 22: Zombiestein " in Attack Position. Yuma says he's going to avenge Tetsuo, as Eviluder is shocked at the 4500 ATK of "Zombiestein". Tokunosuke celebrates that by that way, Yuma is going to take down that starship. Cathy recalls that "Zombiestein" can't attack girls, and wonders if that won't matter, but Kotori says starships aren't male or female, and tells Yuma to go get it. Yuma orders "Zombiestein" to bring down "Galaxy Tomahawk", as "Zombiestein" jumps towards it. However, Eviluder says "Galaxy Tomahawk" wouldn't fall to an attack like that, as he activates " Spaceship Barrier ", which would  negate  the attack, but Yuma activates the effect of "Zombiestein", negating the  Trap Card , as he declares the attack - Zombiestein Fist. An explosion occurs, and Cathy and Kotori celebrate holding hands, but quickly separate, noting what they were doing. Eviluder smirks and tells Yuma to take a good look to see who is winning. He declares that he activated " Tomahawk Cannon " before Yuma attacked, saying that the effect of "Zombiestein" only works once per turn. A cannon appears in "Galaxy Tomahawk", as it declares "energy charge at 120%". The cannon then fires, destroying "Zombiestein".
 
         Yuma bets everything on his  face-down  card.     
 Kotori mourns about the destruction of "Zombiestein", as Takashi says that's bad. Yuma wonders what he should do, and Astral tells him there's still a way - their deck still has the means to defeat him, and tells Yuma to activate " Reload ". Yuma does so,  shuffling  the 2 cards in his hand into his Deck, and drawing 2 new cards. Astral hopes one of the drawn cards is "that card", as Yuma notes one of them is a card he got from Tetsuo. Tetsuo is shown muttering Yuma's name, still unconscious in the hospital. Back to the Duel, Astral tells Yuma to Set a card, and Yuma does so, ending his  turn . Eviluders says Yuma has no monsters, and even if he did, they would be powerless against his Galaxy fleet. He declares that he is going to wipe out Yuma's forces on the next turn, and that he would end up just like "that other Duelist", while  Shark  wonders what is Yuma's  face-down  card, and  Kaito  wonders if that's the end for Yuma.
 
 Featured Duel: Yuma Tsukumo vs. Eviluder 
 Duel continues from  the previous Rank . 
 Turn 2: Eviluder 
Eviluder  activates  the  effect  of " No. 42: Starship Galaxy Tomahawk ",  detaching  1  Xyz Material  in order to  Special Summon  as many " Battle Eagle Tokens " as possible, which will be destroyed during the end of the  turn . He Summons 4 "Battle Eagle Tokens" (all 2000/0) in  Attack Position . Eviluder activates " Covering Fire ", increasing the  ATK  of all  Machine - Type   monster  on the  field  by 500 this turn - the ATK of all "Battle Eagle Tokens" increase by 500, to 2500. Eviluder  attacks  " No. 39: Utopia " with the first  token , but Yuma activates its effect, detaching an Xyz Material to  negate  the attack. Eviluder attacks with the second token, with Yuma detaching the last Xyz Material from "Utopia" to negate the attack. The third token successfully attacks "Utopia",  destroying  both monsters. The last token attacks Yuma  directly  (Yuma 4000 → 1500). Eviluder  Sets  2 cards. During the  End Phase , the 3 remaining "Battle Eagle Tokens" are destroyed.
 Turn 3: Yuma 
Yuma  Normal Summons  " Gagaga Girl " (1000/800), and activates " Gagaga Academy Emergency Network ", which allows him to Special Summon a " Gagaga " monster from his  Deck  - he summons " Gagaga Magician " (1500/1000). Yuma activates the effect of "Gagaga Magician", increasing its  Level  to 8. He then activates the effect of "Gagaga Girl", making her Level equal to that of "Gagaga Magician" - 8. Yuma Overlays his two now Level 8 monsters to  Xyz Summon  " No. 22: Zombiestein " (4500/1000) in Attack Position. Yuma attacks "Starship Galaxy Tomahawk" with "Zombiestein", with Eviluder activating his  face-down  " Spaceship Barrier ", which would negate the attack, but Yuma  chains  with the effect of "Zombiestein", detaching an Xyz Material and  discarding  1 card to negate the effect of Eviluder's current  face-up  cards. Eviluder then activates a second face-down card, " Tomahawk Cannon ", which negates the attack of "Zombiestein" and destroys it. Yuma activates " Reload ", shuffling the 2 cards in his  hand  back to his Deck in order to  draw  2 other cards. He Sets a card.
 Duel continues in  the next Rank .

 Errors 
 The name and lore of the  Trap Card  " Spaceship Barrier " read "Spaceship" instead of "Starship", despite being activated when " No. 42: Galaxy Tomahawk " (a " Starship "  monster ) was  attacked . The English translation kept the mistake. 
 In the English version, " No. 39: Utopia " was once referred to as "Hope", a shorterned form of its Japanese name "King of Wishes, Hope".
