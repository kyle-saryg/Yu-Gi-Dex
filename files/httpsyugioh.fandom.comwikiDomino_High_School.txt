 Events 
 Early manga/first series anime 
 The hall monitor  Ushio  beat-up  Jonouchi  and  Honda  here, under the excuse that he was protecting  Yugi  from them bullying him. He imposed a bodyguard fee ¥200,000 and beat-up Yugi when he stuck up for Jonouchi and Honda. (In the  first series anime , he beat up Yugi for not being able to pay.) However Yugi solved the  Millennium Puzzle  and as  Dark Yugi  confronted Ushio and beat him in a  Shadow Game ,  Money and Knife . [3] [4] 
 ZTV  hosted the staged bullying documentary  Caught on Camera: School Violence  for  Survival Morning  here.  The director  told his assistant  Fujita  to pose as a student and beat-up Yugi in front of a camera. Jonouchi broke up the fight, but when he confronted the director, he was limited by what he could do, as he was being filmed. Afterwards, Dark Yugi defeated in the director in a  dice game  Shadow Game. [5] 
 The alleged psychic,  Kokurano , hosted a service during recess in one of the classrooms, in which he would make predictions for other students. Among his predictions were Anzu would meet a man and swoon before him in love and countless letters would fall from the heavens and bring disaster on Yugi. He tried forcing his prediction about Yugi to come true, by knocking bookshelves in the school library on him. However Yugi switched to Dark Yugi, who survived being injured. Kokurano tried making his prediction about Anzu come true by using chloroform to make her swoon before him. However he was confronted by Dark Yugi, who defeated him in the Shadow Game,  Paper Crash! , in a classroom and exposed him as a fraud. Yu-Gi-Oh!|6|ref-6|[6] [7] 
 
         The  school festival .     
 At the thirtieth annual  school festival , Yugi's class setup a  Carnival Games  booth, but it was torn down by  Goro Inogashira 's class for their  okonomiyaki  stand. However Dark Yugi won the spot back in a game of  Griddle Ice Hockey . Yu-Gi-Oh!|6|ref-6|[6] 
 The strict teacher,  Ms. Chono , earned the nickname The Wicked Witch of Expel, after expelling six students over the course of six months. Angered over how a recent  omiai  went, she tired taking her anger out on her students by performing a bag and desk inspection. She found a wrapped gift on  Miho Nosaka 's desk, which was a  love jigsaw puzzle  from Honda. She began solving the jigsaw and reading its love message out to the class. With school rules against dating, she threatened to punish the sender, but lied that she might forgive them if they confess. Yugi, Jonouchi and Honda all confessed, so Chono continued to solve the puzzle to find out who really sent it. However Dark Yugi changed the jigsaw into the  Dark Puzzle  Shadow Game, so that Chono felt the pain she was inflicting on others as she solved the jigsaw. As she was about to announce who the sender was, her makeup peeled in parts shaped like jigsaw pieces, revealing her true ugly self. Chono then ran out of the room, insisting that the class never happened. [2] 
 Kaiba  and Dark Yugi had  their first Duel  here after Kaiba attempted to steal  Sugoroku 's " Blue-Eyes White Dragon " card. [8] [9] [10]
