 Design 
 Appearance 
       The "Abyss Actor" crest.     
 The "Abyss Actor"  monsters  are based on different kinds of performing artists, as different monstrous or doll-like forms, though generally anthropomorphic. In the anime, the "Abyss Actors" change their appearances when used with "Abyss Script" cards, such as " Abyss Actor - Superstar ", which dons a new costume, fitting to it performing the role of the "Abyss Script", such as being a wizard when used with "Abyss Script - Fantasy Magic" and a knight when used with "Abyss Script - Fire Dragon's Lair". Most of the "Abyss Actors" also share a common theme in having only one eye (or covering an eye), as well as them all bearing a pinkish purple Crest somewhere on their bodies or outfits.
 
 Etymology 
 The "Abyss Actor" monsters tend to follow a pattern of "Abyss Actor" followed by an adjective (excluding " Abyss Actor - Extras ") and then the performing art role that the "Abyss Actor" is based off of.

 Playing style 
       Sylvio Sawatari  with " Abyss Actor - Funky Comedian ", " Abyss Actor - Superstar " and " Abyss Actor - Evil Heel " in the  anime .     
 The  archetype 's playing style relies on taking advantage of  Pendulum Summoning . Their  Pendulum Effects   activate  by  returning  Pendulum Monsters to the  Extra Deck , for Pendulum Summons or extra Scales, while several "Abyss Script" spells have versatile effects that further support the deck. 
 " Abyss Actor - Evil Heel " and " Abyss Actor - Funky Comedian " have both  Pendulum Scale  and Monster effects for changing ATK favourably, but are Level 8 and 1 respectively (Cannot be Pendulum Summoned normally); needing the effect of " Abyss Actor - Trendy Understudy " to  Special Summon  them, " Abyss Actor - Wild Hope " to change the other Pendulum Scale to 9, or scale 9 " Abyss Actor - Twinkle Little Star ".
 When  destroyed by battle  or card effect: " Abyss Actor - Wild Hope " lets you add any "Abyss Actor" card from your deck to your hand, and " Abyss Actor - Sassy Rookie " can both  Special Summon  a Level 4 or lower "Abyss Actor" from the Main Deck, this archetype also has many effects to return it's face-up Monsters from the Extra Deck to the hand: so these two Level 4 Monsters, " Abyss Actor - Extras " (Effect restricts Special Summoning to only "Abyss Actor" monsters), " Abyss Actor - Mellow Madonna " (Pendulum Effect allows you to add another Actor, while Monster Effect lets you Special Summon a Level 4 or lower Abyss Actor from Deck) and the Trap Card " Abyss Actors Back Stage " are how this archetype searches to gain card advantage. The archetype has also gained a Link 1 monster in " Abyss Actor - Hyper Director ", that further allows you to search an appropriate Scale from the deck, while Special Summoning an Actor from the Pendulum Zone. 
 The archetype is supported by " Abyss Script "  Spell Cards , which can be searched by " Abyss Actor - Superstar ", two of which have the most immediate impact are: " Fire Dragon's Lair " for banishing 3 cards from the Extra Deck (opponent's choice) and " Rise of the Abyss King "  for card removal. 
 "Abyss Script" Spell Cards also have secondary effects triggered when they are destroyed by your opponent's card effects, but you can also  force  this by giving a face-down " Absorbing Jar " to your opponent and attacking it, or using both the Monster and Pendulum effect of " Abyss Actor - Comic Relief ". 
 It should be noted that a lot of essential "Abyss Actor" effects, like " Abyss Actor - Mellow Madonna " or " Abyss Actor - Extras " will prevent you from summoning any monsters outside of the archetype for the rest of the turn they had been activated in. It is recommended to summon " Abyss Actor - Hyper Director " before using the  " Abyss Actor - Mellow Madonna " Pendulum effect, as afterward it can no longer be Link Summoned due to it not being a Pendulum monster.
