 Dinosaur Ryuzaki  and  Esper Roba  had a Duel in the preliminaries of the  Battle City  tournament.
 Roba won the Duel, although he cheated by having his younger brother's spy on Ryuzaki's cards, while he accredited his knowledge of Ryuzaki's cards to  ESP .
 Most of the Duel took place off panel.
 
 Events 
 Roba used " Mesmeric Control " to put Ryuzaki's monster to sleep weakening it. He then  attacked  and  destroyed  it with " Jinzo ", winning the Duel. [1] 
 As Roba called for his next opponent, most of the bystanders were too put off by his alleged ESP. Ryuzaki warned  Katsuya Jonouchi  not to consider, saying he would not stand a chance. But Jonouchi was intent on becoming a stronger Duelist and refused to pass up on an opponent. [1]
