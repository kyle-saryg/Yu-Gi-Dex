 The  Match winners  are a  series  of monsters that allow the player to  win  the entire  Match  instead of just the  Duel .
 With the exception of  Pendulum Monsters  without a Monster Effect, Match winners have a  condition  that causes its  controller  to win the Match if it decreases the opponent's  Life Points  to 0 with a  direct attack  (sometimes with additional requirements, such as having an  Xyz Material  of a certain  Type ). For Match winners that are Pendulum Monsters, their Pendulum Effect includes an  Ignition Effect  that allows them to  banish  3 monsters of the same Type as it controlled by the player, then target a Pendulum Monster, which then causes its controller to win the Match if it decreases the opponent's Life Points to 0 with a direct attack that turn.
 All Match winners have a high  Level / Rank ,  ATK  (with the exception of " Leonardo's Silver Skyship "), and  DEF , and require the use of 3 monsters to be Summoned (with the exception of  Normal  Pendulum Monsters), some or all of which must be of a specific  Type . For example, the  Main Deck  Match winners all cannot be  Special Summoned  (except the  Pendulum Monsters ), and require 3  Tributes  of the same  Type  as themselves in order to be  Tribute Summoned  (except Pendulum Monsters without a Monster Effect).
 
 
 Design 
 Starting from 2013, all Match winners have a design representative of the country or city which hosted the  World Championship  where the cards were originally distributed.
 The match winners for 2013, " Grandopolis, The Eternal Golden City " and " E☆HERO Pit Boss " were based on  Las Vegas , the host city for that year's World Championship.
 The match winners for 2014, " The Twin Kings, Founders of the Empire " and " Leonardo's Silver Skyship " were references to  Italy , the host country for that year's World Championship, which was held in  Rimini .
 The match winners for 2015, " Kuzunoha, the Onmyojin " and " Sakyo, Swordmaster of the Far East " were references to  Japan , the host country for that year's World Championship, which was held in  Kyoto .
 The match winners for 2016, " Juno, the Celestial Goddess " and " Shelga, the Tri-Warlord " were references to  Florida , the host state for that year's World Championship.
 The match winners for 2017, " Iron Knight of Revolution " and " Sanctity of Dragon ", were references to  England , which was the original host country of that year's World Championship, Which was meant to be held in  London , but was changed to  Tokyo  in the end. 
 The match winners for 2018, " Noritoshi in Darkest Rainment " and " Amatsu-Okami of the Divine Peaks " were references to  Japan , the host state for that year's World Championship. Which was held in  Chiba . 
 The match winners for 2019, " Skyfaring Castle of the Black Forest " and " Kaiser Eagle, the Heavens' Mandate " were references to  Germany , the host state for that year's World Championship. Which was held in  Berlin 
 
 Distribution 
 The first Match winner, " Victory Dragon ", was given away as a promotional card with " Shonen Jump Magazine ". It was quickly made  Forbidden  due to its ability to interfere with something outside of the current Duel, leading to many ruling hassles and declarations of unsportsmanlike conduct regarding players who would  surrender  right before "Victory Dragon" attacked, therefore losing only the Duel instead of the Match.
 All Match winners since the release of "Victory Dragon" have only been available as top  prize cards  or attendance cards at each year's  World Championship , making them almost impossible to obtain, with prices easily amounting in thousands of dollars or more per card. All of them, barring "Victory Dragon", have the  limitation text : "This card cannot be used in a Duel" present on the lower left corner of the card, making them  illegal  in official tournaments.
 Two new Match winners debut at each World Championship, with a single  Ultra Rare  copy of one card being given to the champion and three  Ultra Rare  copies of the other being given to the 2nd, 3rd, and 4th place finishers. A  Super Rare  reprint of the previous year's top Match winner is also given out to all attendees. This reprint always has the word " REPLICA " printed on it, and is generally less expensive than the original version, although the price is still astronomically high compared to most other cards.
 Starting from 2013, the previous year's Match winners have received reprints in the current year's  OCG -exclusive  Extra Pack  as  Extra Secret Rare  cards; the first to be released were the 2012 Match winners, " Legendary Dragon of White " and " Legendary Magician of Dark ", in the 2013 set  Extra Pack: Sword of Knights .
 The Match winners " Legendary Dragon of White " and " Legendary Magician of Dark " were reprinted in  World Superstars , marking the first time Match winners were printed in the  TCG  in a language other than English.
