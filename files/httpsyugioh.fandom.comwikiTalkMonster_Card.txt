 "Without Monsters, you don't have a chance at winning." 
 I beg to differ! It is possible to win without monsters if you have lots of direct-damage cards:
 Final Flame  x3 = 1800 damage
 Hinotama  x3 = 1500 damage
 Restructer Revolution  (with 6 cards in opponent's hand) x3 = 3600 damage
 Tremendous Fire  x3 = 3000 damage
 It would be hard to pull off, but I think it can be done. You would need stall cards ( Magic Cylinder  is also an option)

 Some Fixes and Changes 
 I'm putting up a list of monsters under Members, in a way similar to  Spell Cards  and  Trap Cards . I'm working on explanations for  Normal Monsters ,  Effect Monsters ,  Ritual Monsters ,  Fusion Monsters ,  Monster Tokens  and  Synchro Monsters  on the main page, and I'd appreciate a montage picture of them (Normal, Effect, Ritual, Fusion, Token and Synchro) for this page.
