      A few of the  Card Professors  that appear in the  manga .     The  Card Professors Guild  is a mercenary group of duelists who debut in  Yu-Gi-Oh! R , they are hired specifically by  Yako Tenma  to stop  Yugi Muto 's ascent to the top floor of  KaibaCorp . Although it is not specifically stated if the groups are one and the same, the term "Card Professor" was originally used by  Seto Kaiba  in the manga to describe famous duelists who competed for large prizes specifically in the United States. The most well-known of these fanatical collectors was  Keith Howard , known as "Bandit Keith" because of his reputation for claiming prizes in tournaments. It is unknown whether of not all of the known "Card Professors" are a member of this group, but the events in  Yu-Gi-Oh! R  make it clear that Keith was not a member of the guild prior to his resurrection. The organization spends the duration of the story serving under  Yako Tenma , who had hired them to prevent Yugi and his friends from reaching the top of the Kaiba Corporation building where he was holding up.  Only thirteen of them appear in Yu-Gi-Oh! R, but it is not explicitly stated if there are more members of the guild.  
 Membership 
 Although they work for a designated employer, it is not clearly defined who the leader of the Card Professors is, but the strongest duelist amongst them has the privilege of using the  Black Duel Disk . This special Duel Disk has anti-cheating detection software built-in to the hardware that will set off an alarm if the user attempts to break the rules while using it. This specialized piece of equipment was initially used by  Richie Merced , but he was defeated by  Keith Howard  and forced to surrender the Duel Disk to him. During the rematch duel with  Joey Wheeler , Keith lost a second time and gave it to him. At the end of the manga, Joey passes it down to  Tilla Mook  in repayment for her having previously lent Joey her Duel Disk.
 Despite no clear leader being present in the group, not all of the Card Professors have equal standing in the group. For example,  Reiko Kitamori , despite her excellent dueling prowess and amazing strategies (even better, considering she'd only been playing Duel Monsters for roughly a month), was used as little more than a last-resort disposable pawn to stall for time.
