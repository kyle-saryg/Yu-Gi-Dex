 Biography 
 History 
 10,000 years ago, Ancient Fairy Dragon served the  Crimson Dragon  and fought alongside it and the other  Signer Dragons  in the  ancient battle  against the Crimson Devil,  Red Nova . [1] 
 5,000 years ago, Ancient Fairy fought with the other Signer Dragons in the  battle  against the  Earthbound Immortals . The dragons managed to seal the Immortals within the  Nazca Lines , but  Uru  grabbed Ancient Fairy Dragon with its web and dragged it into the earth with the other Earthbound Immortals. [2] 
 Sometime later, Ancient Fairy Dragon became the ruler of the  Duel Monsters Spirit World  (though it is not explained in the series how she ended up there) and kept watch of the spirits that resided there.  Regulus  the white lion is the servant to Ancient Fairy Dragon. [3] 
 In the twenty first century,  Dr. Fudo  created "Ancient Fairy Dragon" and three other Signer Dragons as  Duel Monsters  cards to be used as key cards for the reactors of the Old  Ener-D . After  Roman Goodwin  betrayed him, he dropped "Ancient Fairy Dragon", which then fell into Roman's possession, until he gave it to  Devack .
 When three-year old  Luna  entered the Spirit World, Ancient Fairy Dragon watched over her, too. She warned Luna of an evil that threatened the land and had Luna promise that she would protect it. Unable to cope with the responsibility, Luna broke her promise and returned to her own world. [3] 
 After Luna left, the Spirit World became polluted with evil. [3]   Zeman the Ape King  used the  Minus Curse  to seal Ancient Fairy Dragon in stone.
 
 Fortune Cup 
 At the age of eleven, Luna returned to the  Spirit World . She encountered Ancient Fairy Dragon in the Ancient Forest, which has been destroyed by  Professor Frank . Ancient Fairy Dragon managed to move around while in her prison and seized Frank. As she proceeded to attack Frank, Luna managed to force her Duel with Frank into a  DRAW , returning herself and Frank to their world and saving Frank from the Dragon's angry spirit. [3] 
 
 Dark Signers 
 While Luna is held captive by the  Arcadia Movement , she communicates with Ancient Fairy Dragon for help. Although Ancient Fairy Dragon is unable to help, she says her servant  Regulus  will help Luna, [4]  in the hopes that Luna will join forces with the white lion to free the Dragon's spirit.
 
       Luna and Torunka watching where Ancient Fairy Dragon is sealed     
 During the present day battle between the  Signers  and  Dark Signers , Luna travels to the  Spirit World  to save Ancient Fairy Dragon. [5]  Luna, Regulus, and  Torunka  manage to convince  Zeman  that the only way for him to minus Ancient Fairy completely is to release her first, and then place the Curse on both the Dragon and Regulus. The Ape King is easily deceived and begins to release Ancient Fairy Dragon.
 However, Zeman eventually finds out they were trying to trick him and orders his army to attack them. Fortunately, he is killed by Regulus at the same moment  Leo  defeats his  Duel Monsters   counterpart  that was being used by Devack in the human world. Torunka then sends Luna back to the human world, so she can take her brother's place. 
 Devack Summons "Ancient Fairy Dragon" with " Cursed Prison ", which keeps her chained and caged. Luna takes Leo's place in the Duel and forces him to sacrifice the dragon to prevent the  destruction  of " Earthbound Immortal Cusillu ". Luna then uses Leo's " Respect Synchron " to revive "Ancient Fairy Dragon" back to the twins' side of the field. As this occurs, Regulus appears to shatter the bindings of his Mistress. Luna then proceeds to activate the dragon's  effect  to  Destroy  the  Field Spell Card , " Closed Forest ",  negating  all the effects of "Cusillu" and rendering it useless. Luna  attacks  it with " Power Tool Dragon " and "Ancient Fairy Dragon" to destroy the " Earthbound Immortal " and defeat Devack.
 After the  Shadow Duel  ends, Ancient Fairy Dragon and Regulus both appear as spirits not only to Luna but also to Leo,  Yusei Fudo  and  Tetsu Trudge  too. Ancient Fairy Dragon thanks her and informs her that the spirits used to Summon the "Earthbound Immortal" have all been returned to the spirit world. After stating that they will support Luna in the fight against the Dark Signers, Regulus and Ancient Fairy Dragon materialize into Luna's hands as  Duel Monsters  cards.
 During Yusei, Jack, and  Crow's  Duel against  Rex Goodwin , Ancient Fairy Dragon is Summoned by Luna to help fight off condors summoned by the  King of the Netherworld . [6] 
 
 Ark Cradle 
 After  Leo  Summons " Power Tool Dragon " and " Ancient Fairy Dragon " in an attempt to protect  Luna  from  Aporia , he died due to  the device  attached to his heart by Aporia. Ancient Fairy Dragon called out to him, telling him that it wasn't yet his time to die and that he is the one that must save Luna. The  effect  of his " Morphtronic Lantron " activates, and he is revived with a mere 100  Life Points . After the  Crimson Dragon 's seal appears on his back to bestow him the Heart  mark , Ancient Fairy Dragon tells Leo that he is the sixth Signer and that all she wants is for Luna to be safe forever.
