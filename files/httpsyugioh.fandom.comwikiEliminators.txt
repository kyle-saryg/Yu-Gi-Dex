      Various Eliminators hired by Pegasus     
 Eliminators , known as  Player Killers  (プレイヤーキラー  Pureiyā Kirā ) in the manga and Japanese version, were duelists employed by  Maximillion Pegasus  for the  Duelist Kingdom  tournament. Their role in the tournament was to Duel other contestants to try to take away their  Star Chips  and get them disqualified from the tournament.
 Pegasus hired the Eliminators to ensure that only four finalists could reach  Pegasus Castle . As there were eighty Star Chips in total issued (with ten required to enter the castle), the Eliminators' duty was to retrieve the extra forty Star Chips, to ensure no more than four finalists could enter. In the case of the  Ventriloquist of the Dead / Ghost Kaiba , he was assigned primarily to defeat  Yugi Muto , as he could imitate  Seto Kaiba  to intimidate the young duelist. There was also apparently a bounty system in place, as  PaniK  noted that Yugi had a particularly high bounty placed on him.
