 This section, or a part of it, has been transcluded from  Yu-Gi-Oh! GX - Volume 001 ; any changes involving it should be made  there  instead.  /  
 Years after Yugi's legendary battles, the game is so popular that special institutions dedicated to the art of the Duel have sprung up all over the world. Join Jaden Yuki and his pals at the Academy for the adventures of the next generation of "Yu-Gi-Oh!" [1] 
 Let the Tournament Begin!! 
 The Duel Academy Tournament moves into high gear as Jaden and his friends battle it out with each other for a chance to duel the legendary Zane "Kaiser" Truesdale. American duelists David Rabb and Reggie Mackenzie are also in the running, but their goal is not to take the title of Duel Champion—they're after nothing less than Winged Kuriboh, Jaden's most trusted, and enchanted, card! [2] 
 
 The Story So Far 
 On an island in the southern sea there is an academy that trains the next generation of duelists—the Duel Academy! Jaden Yuki learned about the excitement of dueling through an encounter with the World Dueling Champion, Koyo Hibiki. Entrusted with Hibiki's deck, Jaden takes on all challengers at the Academy in order to become a true duelist! 
 Syrus's older brother Zane, aka Kaiser, the top-ranked duelist, has returned from America and a tournament is being held at the Academy to win the right to challenge him. Jaden and the others, including some exchange students from America, have battled through the preliminaries. But  what lies in store for them in the finals?! [2] 
 
 In the Next Volume… 
 The Duel Academy tournament enters its semi-final rounds and only the best duelists remain. Jaden's in the running for the top sot, but he's got to take on his old friend and rival Bastion Misawa. The scheming David Rabb, manipulated by an evil spirit, faces Chazz Princeton in his semi-final round. To make things interesting, he challenges Chazz to a Shadow Game! Who will face off in the final round? Find out in the next volume of " Yu-Gi-Oh! GX!! "

 Message from Kazuki Takahashi 
 The  "Yu-Gi-Oh! GX"  anime is finished but the adventures of Jaden and his friends continue in the manga. The new series  "Yu-Gi-Oh! 5D's"  begins in April, so hope you'll help me support Kageyama. Thanks a lot! [2] 
 
 Message from Naoyuki Kageyama 
 The title of the book is  "Yu-Gi-Oh! GX" . Beyond giving things the  "Yu-Gi-Oh!"  name I want them to be original. That's why we use the ka tablets. I've been involved with  "Yu-Gi-Oh!"  for ten years now. It's really gone by quickly! [2]
