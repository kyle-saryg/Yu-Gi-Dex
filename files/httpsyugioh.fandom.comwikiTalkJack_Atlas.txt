 Voice Act 
 Since the world premiered yesterday am sure that everyone else noticed that Jack actually sounds like Alister from the Yugioh series because its done by the same actor.
 
 Who in turn was the same voice actor that did Bakura.-- TwoTailedFox  ( My Talk Page ) 19:16, 14 September 2008 (UTC) 
 His name is Ted Lewis. And yes, Jack sounds like Bakura.
 
 Vice Dragon 
 Shouldn't vice dragon edited to form his ground deck??
 
 He used Vice Dragon in both Decks. To date (20.10.08) it used only at the Anime Special Tour.  Diehard Guy  10:17, 20 October 2008 (UTC) 
 Help 
 Someone keeps removing the cards that Jack used in the japanese anime version.... protect the page, please.  TeardropStar  18:44, 3 January 2009 (UTC)
 
 When did he use them? It's more likely this person doesn't think Jack used the cards. Protecting the page shouldn't be necessary. Say when they appeared in your edit summary on on their user talk page. --  Deltaneos  ( talk ) 19:30, 3 January 2009 (UTC) 
 English dub accent 
 is there a difference between British and Cockney? just asking before I make a mistake in editing. -- XD Master  22:06, 29 March 2009 (UTC)
 
 Duel Against Garome 
 Has anyone else seen the sub? Marco's reaction suggest that only the two Smile monsters came from his deck for that duel.  Burnpsy  17:59, 30 July 2009 (UTC)
 Yusei and Crow both knew that Jack was going to use Zero Hole, Marco did not react to Power Invader or Zero Hole or Compulsory Return Device. Those three were Jack's cards, Smile Kids and Smile Angel are Marco's
 
 Ramen 
 Although it's probably not an important detail, Jack does seem to like ramen quite a bit in the anime. Anyway, where in the article would that go? I removed it from the "Voice and Mannerisms" section since it didn't really seem to fit. -- Blue  ( Talk ) 02:19, November 10, 2009 (UTC)
 
 Shuji Maruyama 
 is he the real artist? -- KiumaruHamachi  21:23, January 2, 2010 (UTC)KiumaruHamachi
 
 Goodwin's son 
 In the manga, Goodwin has called Jack "son" and Jack has called Goodwin "father". I'm not sure we can take that as them literally being related. It's common for older or more authoritative people to refer to boys as "son", without being related to them. And vice-versa for father.
 In response to  this undo , for people who don't have a Janime forums account, it points to a summary, written by Horoko, of  Ride 9 . Important part is it says that Jack said  "Father... the D1GP is a very fine name for a tournament..."  This doesn't contradict what I said in the  previous summary . What I said actually takes that into account. I'm aware that Jack called Goodwin "father". All the examples I gave in the summary, show that people use terms like "father" and "son", without actually being related to the person they are addressing.
 I had been under the impression, that the community had accepted that they weren't actually related or at least there's not enough evidence to say that they are yet.
 
 User:Trivi-AM  agreed on IRC. 
 PoirotH  I think agreed  here 
 FredCat100  agreed  here . 
 If anyone thinks that we should say that they are related, can you post your reasons here. Similarly if anyone else agrees with me, let us know here. And hopefully we can agree on which version to accept. --  Deltaneos  ( talk ) 20:14, May 2, 2010 (UTC)
 OK, i understand about the "son" thing as it is common for elder men to say such things, but i was unaware people commonly refer to people as fathers in the same sense. :P-- RexGodwin  06:48, May 6, 2010 (UTC)
 
 Poor grammar 
 Someone's written something about Jack Atlas battling the Ghosts, but with such a horrible grammar... could someone fix it?  —This unsigned comment was made by  109.175.42.250  ( talk  •  contribs ) 21:33, 8 May 2010 (UTC) 
 
 I'll see about correcting that section, now that you've brought it up. You know you are allowed to edit this page yourself? --  Deltaneos  ( talk ) 07:00, May 9, 2010 (UTC) 
 Borrowed Cards 
 Speed Warrior , why do you keep removing Smile Kid, Smile Angel, and Chaos King Archfiend from Jack's Deck list? Deck lists like Akiza's clearly keep track of " Borrowing " Yusei's Stardust Dragon, so what makes it so different for Jack?

 Scar-Red Nova 
 I'm not too sure about this weater it should go on sacar-red nova or jacks page but i'll put it on to both and see which gets deleted... (delete if inapropriate to page)
When i searched for stuff like *(Not actual term)ancient serpent into google you get stuff about the serpent mound in africa and that looks (when drawn out in like form picture link here > http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Serpent_Mounds_sketch.jpg  i think it looks like the line drawn at the end of 112 anyone else?
 
 Japan Name - Atlas or Atlus? 
 What happened to that name; Atlus, on the main article, was it remove or what? -- FredCat100  ( talk  •  contribs ) 18:50, July 30, 2010 (UTC)
 
 It was believed to be a mistake after the things brought up in  this forum , but since the spelling "Atlus" has been used even more times since the forum was created and never spelled "Atlas" in the Japanese anime, I'm guessing it wasn't a mistake or it has at least been used enough times for us to mention it. --  Deltaneos  ( talk ) 19:35, July 30, 2010 (UTC) 
 Okay, I've added a bit to the intro highlighting the different spellings in the Japanese version. --  Deltaneos  ( talk ) 19:42, July 30, 2010 (UTC) 
 "Atlas" was showing in  episode 120 , as showed on the screen when Team Taiyou leader scanned the Team 5D's stat. -- FredCat100  ( talk  •  contribs ) 20:11, July 30, 2010 (UTC) 
 Ah, so it was. Added that to the article too. --  Deltaneos  ( talk ) 21:11, July 30, 2010 (UTC) 
 Relationships 
 I mean, he's pretty much the second most important character but has no relationship section? Someone wanna fix this?
 
 Age difference 
 I'm not a member, so I don't know if this will show up, but I had a question regarding his age. In the show, Jack says that he was born in the Satellite while Yusei was born in New Domino. In my opinion, that makes Yusei older than Jack. Yet, the info box just has Jack at 19. My question is this: is that accurate? I was really confused on the age difference because a lot of people I have talked to are under the impression that Jack is older...
 Yeah, I'm really confused lol  —This unsigned comment was made by  22:48, 30 November 2010 (UTC)  ( talk  •  contribs )  
 
 You're correct about their birthplace, but Jack born first, Yusei a year later. As of current episode, I am sure he's around 20 years old. As following of Yusei; 19 years old. -- F red C at   Ta.P.  •  F.P.  •  J.R.  •  W.S.  •  Th.P.  •  S.C.  22:52, November 30, 2010 (UTC) 
 Yeah, but from own understanding, Satellite was created after Zero Reverse. If Jack was older, Yusei would have had to have been born in Satellite, not New Domino...if that makes any sense.  —This unsigned comment was made by  71.236.81.24  ( talk  •  contribs ) 06:04, 17 December 2010 (UTC) 
 Dub accent 
 Jack is categorically, inarguable, undeniably NOT Australian. He is speaking with a (rather terrible impression of a) Cockney accent. This accent, especially when emulated by American actors, has a torrid history of confusing American listeners, who often muddle it with Australian, but they're really quite clearly different if you stop to  listen . You can't hear the difference between Jack and Jim Crook? The Australian accent has drawled vowel sounds, the British accent is clipped. The phoenetic descriptions of a few words in this article? "Lit'l?" That's Cockney. The Australian pronunciation would be "Liddle." It's supposed to make him sound snooty and demeaning to the other characters, which is Jack's whole shtick. That's not what an Australian accent conveys at all. And you'll find a few instances of Jack using British idioms - why, I was watching episode 68 last night, in which he refers to Yusei and Crow as "you lads" - and zero instances of him using stereotypical Australian idioms like "bonzer" or "fair dinkum" or "dingo" or "crook" or whatever, which the speech of both Jim and Valon - another dub Aussie - were peppered with (EDIT: I'm sure there actually MUST be some instances of "mate", as that's a British idiom too). He is utterly, utterly British. --  Chris McFeely  ( talk  •  contribs ) 23:41, March 23, 2012 (UTC)
 
 Impressive explanation, I will let Admins eff this one up. -- F r e d C a t  23:44, March 23, 2012 (UTC) 
 I agree as well (I only tried to stop the small edit warring by directing you here so you could give an explanation for those other unregistered users to see).  Shardsilver  ( talk  •  contribs ) 23:52, March 23, 2012 (UTC) 
 ARC-V? 
 Just wondering, what's with Jack in Arc-V? Should we post a tiny bit more detail of the little bit we have?  —This unsigned comment was made by  SignerStardust  ( talk  •  contribs ) 20:27, March 22, 2015 (UTC)

 Jack Atlas ARC-V Picture 
 When Jack Atlas and Crow Hogan enter ARC-V, would we maintain their current 5D's picture as their main picture or change it to their ARC-V version. --FlashEmperor 16:36, April 18, 2015 (UTC)
 
 We might just make a separate article for them, like "Jack Atlas (ARC-V)". I have a feeling they will have different histories/timelines. -- UltimateKuriboh  ( talk  •  contribs ) 16:40, April 18, 2015 (UTC) 
 You predicted the future o_o  -Signer, the person writing a Barian Primo fanfiction
