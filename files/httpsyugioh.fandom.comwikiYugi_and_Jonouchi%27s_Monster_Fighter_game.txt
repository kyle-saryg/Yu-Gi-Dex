 Yugi and Jonouchi's  Monster Fighter  game  was a game of  Monster Fighter  between  Yugi Mutou  and  Katsuya Jonouchi  in the  Yu-Gi-Oh!  manga .
 
 Events 
 The game took place shortly after Yugi and  Sugoroku  introduced Jonouchi to  Monster Fighter . Yugi used the monster " Alti " and Jonouchi used " Killer Emaada ".
 Jonouchi began the game with "Killer Emaada" right punching "Alti", who blocked the attack. The two continued to punch and kick for a while, until Jonouchi left the weak point of "Killer Emaada", allowing Alti to kick it. This left "Killer Emaada" unable to move for two seconds, during which Yugi got "Alti" to perform his "Mach Tornado Punch", knocking "Killer Emaada" out of the ring.
 The next day at school, Yugi defeated Jonouchi in another round by knocking "Killer Emaada" out of the ring again.
