 How to Ritual Summon 
 A player can Ritual Summon a Ritual Monster by  activating  a card or effect that performs a Ritual Summon, usually a  Ritual Spell Card . When that effect resolves, the player satisfies the requirements of that card or effect which Ritual Summons, usually  Tributing  monsters from their hand and/or field, whose Levels combined equal or exceed the Ritual Monster's. After that, the player Summons the Ritual Monster from the  hand  (or other specified location) to an unoccupied  Main Monster Zone  in  face-up   Attack  or  Defense Position .
 
 Advanced Rulings 
 When a card or effect that Ritual Summons resolves, if the requirement cannot be met or the Ritual Monster cannot be Ritual Summoned, no Ritual Summon occurs, nor is any action taken for the Ritual Summon's requirement. For example, if a player cannot Special Summon when resolving a Ritual Spell Card that Tributes monsters, no monsters are Tributed.
 
 Tributing monsters for a Ritual Summon 
 If the card or effect that Ritual Summons does not mandate an exact total Level (e.g. " You must also Tribute monsters from your hand or field whose total Levels equal 6 or more. "), the player cannot Tribute additional monsters if they already met the minimum Level requirement. [1] 
 Monsters that do not have Levels, such as  Xyz Monsters  and  Link Monsters , cannot be Tributed for a Ritual Summon.
 A player can activate a card or effect that Ritual Summons even if all of their  Main Monster Zones  are used, but only if they Tribute one of their monsters on the field when that card or effect resolves (if all their Main Monster Zones are still occupied by that point). [ citation needed ] 
 Face-down  monsters can be Tributed for a Ritual Summon, unless the card text specifies otherwise (such as " Forbidden Arts of the Gishki ").
 
 Effect 
 As long as the monster is not returned to the  hand  or  Deck , it is considered to have been originally properly Special Summoned, so it can still be Special Summoned from the Graveyard or while banished. 
 Not all Ritual Spell Cards require the player to tribute monsters from their hand/field. In such cases, follow the card effect and its requirements. 
 Example 
 A required Ritual Spell Card (" Black Luster Ritual ") + A Level 7 Tribute (" Gaia The Fierce Knight ") + A Level 4 Tribute (" Manju of the Ten Thousand Hands ") = A corresponding Level 8 Ritual Monster (" Black Luster Soldier ") 
 Anime & Manga 
 Before ARC-V 
 There were no common animation patterns for Ritual Summoning, and the visual effects differ between cards.  Yu-Gi-Oh! 5D's  is the only  Yu-Gi-Oh!  anime that does not feature any Ritual Summon.
 
 Yu-Gi-Oh! ARC-V 
 In  Yu-Gi-Oh! ARC-V , when a Ritual Card is activated, the altar depicted on it appears on the field, and then the Tributed monsters turn into flames (a number of flames equal to the their individual Levels) before positioning themselves on the altar. A pillar of fire rises from the altar and explodes in the sky, after which the Ritual Monster descends from the sky. 
 
 Yu-Gi-Oh! VRAINS 
 In  Yu-Gi-Oh! VRAINS , a circle is formed and the tributed monsters turn into flames that disintegrate into the sky before entering the circle. After entering the circle, an explosion is created, therefore creating a  Ritual Monster .
 
 Manga 
 In the original manga, besides the needed tributes, Ritual Summon also requires a proper monster to become the vessel for the Ritual Monster. For example, when Yugi used " Black Luster Ritual " and " Black Magic Ritual ", he used " Gaia The Fierce Knight " and " Dark Magician " to summon " Black Luster Soldier " and " Magician of Black Chaos ", respectively. Similarly, Maximillion Pegasus used " Dark-Eyes Illusionist " to summon " Relinquished ".
