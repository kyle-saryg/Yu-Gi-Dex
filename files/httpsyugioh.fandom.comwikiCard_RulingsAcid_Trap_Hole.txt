 OCG Rulings 
 When your opponent Flip Summons " Man-Eater Bug " and targets your face-down " Hane-Hane ", you can chain " Acid Trap Hole " to the effect of " Man-Eater Bug " and  target  your " Hane-Hane ".  The effect of " Hane-Hane " cannot interrupt the current  Chain , so it does not activate yet.  " Acid Trap Hole " will destroy " Hane-Hane ", then the effect of " Man-Eater Bug " will resolve without effect - afterwards, the effect of " Hane-Hane "  activates . [1] 
 Previously Official Rulings 
   These TCG rulings were issued by  Upper Deck Entertainment  and have since been deemed unofficial by Konami. [2]  They were previously considered official and can still be correct, as long as they follow the official gameplay rules, or unless Konami has issued a ruling that says otherwise. References:  [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] 
 
 A  face-down  " Jinzo " will be  destroyed  by this card. 
 If the monster  flipped   face-up  has an effect that changes its  DEF , such as " Enraged Muka Muka ", calculate the current DEF, then determine if it will be destroyed or flipped back face-down. So if you had 4 cards in your  hand , " Enraged Muka Muka " would not be destroyed. 
 If the  targeted  monster has a  Flip Effect , that Effect is activated whether the DEF is greater than 2000 or not. If the DEF of the selected monster is 2000 or less, such as a " Hane-Hane ", it can not select itself for its Flip Effect since it is destroyed.
