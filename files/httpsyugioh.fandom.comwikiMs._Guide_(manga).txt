 When  Strong Jukyu  asks for her help to find an opponent to Duel with she blows her whistle at him reminding him that she is only working here part time. Strong calls  Shoma Yusa  over and she informs him that he needs to buy a structure deck and create an ID card to participate in events at the card shop. Miss Guide tells all the duelists that the event is about to begin and tells them the rules. She proceeds to watch the Duel between Shoma and Strong and becomes shocked when Shoma declares that he'll wipe Strong's field in a single turn and wonders if he's bluffing. After the Duel ends in Shoma's victory Miss Guide looks at his ID registration form and believes that he will have lots of fun from now on.
