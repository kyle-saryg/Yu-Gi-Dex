      Tablet of the Legend     
 The  Legend of the Dragons of Light and Time  is a legend that refers to " Number 46: Dragluon ", " Number 62: Galaxy-Eyes Prime Photon Dragon ", "  Number 100: Numeron Dragon ", and " Number 107: Galaxy-Eyes Tachyon Dragon " in the  Yu-Gi-Oh! ZEXAL  anime. 
 
 History 
 Kite Tenjo  discovered a tablet detailing the legend when he returned to  Jinlon 's  ruins  at one point. The tablet stated, "Dragons of light and time, clash at thy place of birth. Then shall the eyes of the galaxies truly awaken for the first time, opening the gate to a new world." At this point Jinlon appeared and explained to  Kite  the origin of the  Galaxy-Eyes  dragons. [1]  He shared the legend with  Quinton , believing it was related to the  Numeron Code  and that said the Code would not function without the proper " Number " cards. He also determined the place of birth was actually the moon and noted he wanted to battle  Mizar  there to test the legend's authenticity and determine who the true " Galaxy-Eyes " master was. [2] 
 
       Tablet of the Moon     
 After the  Seven Barian Emperors  attacked  Earth , Kite opted to head to the moon. When Mizar was about to defeat Quinton and  Trey , Quinton shared the information with Mizar and  Yuma , prompting Mizar to head to the moon himself afterwards. [2]  Once on the moon, Kite saw multiple copies of the same tablet.
 
       Sacred Ground     
 After Mizar arrived, Kite revealed more about the legend told to him by Jinlon himself. According to the Number spirit, the legend regarding both "Galaxy-Eyes" monsters is actually a spell cast by a  dragon  who was responsible for creating the Numeron Code in the first place. Lastly, Kite and Mizar's oncoming Duel will be able to break the spell, and thus whoever wins will obtain the key to use the Numeron Code itself. [1] 
 Kite would later call upon the power of the Numbers to create " Number 62: Galaxy-Eyes Prime Photon Dragon ". [3]  After the Duel, Kite witnessed the powers of his "Number", Mizar's  Mythyrian  and " Over-Hundred Numbers " resonate to form "  Numeron Dragon " and entrusted it to Mizar. [4]
