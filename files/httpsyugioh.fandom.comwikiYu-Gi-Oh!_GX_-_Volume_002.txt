 The Story So Far 
 On an island in the southern sea there is an academy that trains the next generation of duelists—the Duel Academy! There are three ranks, and Jaden Yuki is in Slifer Red, the lowest where students can be expelled for their performance.

Both friends and rivals are always challenging him to duels, and even though they're always tough duels, Jaden is on a winning streak 
 What does the future hold in store for Jaden…?! [2] 
 
 In the Next Volume…

As the competition kicks into high gear, the sinister plans of the mysterious duelists from America, David Rabb and Reggie Mackenzie, begin to unfold. Who will win the tournament, and what will be the ultimate legacy of Koyo Hibiki's dark duel?! Find out in the next volume of "Yu-Gi-Oh! GX"!

 Message from Kazuki Takahashi 
 The characters for "Yu-Gi-Oh! GX" existed first in the anime. But I'm really looking forward to the original characters Kageyama-kun is going to introduce. I hope they're really unique! [2] 
 
 Message from Naoyuki Kageyama 
 The story this time is about the growth of a boy with hurt feelings, and his older sister and younger brother who watch over him. I just wrote this whole story just to be able to draw the picture of Jaden from behind that appears on the last page of the Jaden stories! Greenery, changing leaves, and my alter ego! All except for the face and physique, that is! [2]
