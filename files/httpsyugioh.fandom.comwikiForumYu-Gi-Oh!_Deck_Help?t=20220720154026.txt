 If the post is not constructive,  do not post it . Do not wade in and say "<x> Deck sucks, use <y> Deck instead because everyone else is doing it". We are operating a two-strike warning policy on this; First is a warning, second is a week's ban from the Wikia. We take the idea of constructive helping very seriously, and we will not tolerate disruption to that. 
 If you would like to place a decklist in a query, please use the following:  Template:Decklist . Using this template can help to keep the decklists organized and clean, while keeping the space used in each query to a minimum.
