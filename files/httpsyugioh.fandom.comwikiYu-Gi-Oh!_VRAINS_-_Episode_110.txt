 Ai  has discovered  Akira  and  Blue Maiden  in the network. In order to seize control of  SOL Technologies  system, he challenges the two of them to a Duel. The Zaizen siblings protect each other and fend off Ai's attacks. With their minds as one, the two of them launch a counterattack against Ai.
 
 Featured Duel: Ai vs. Akira & Blue Maiden 
         
 The Duel is conducted as a  Master Duel . 
The Duel is also conducted as a  Tag-Team Duel , with Akira and Blue Maiden teaming up against Ai and sharing the same field,  GY  and LP.
 Turn 1: Blue Maiden 
Blue Maiden  Normal Summons  " Marincess Blue Tang " (1500/1200). As it was Normal or Special Summoned, the effect of "Blue Tang" lets Blue Maiden send a " Marincess " monster with a different name from her  Deck  to the  GY . She chooses " Marincess Sea Horse ". She then uses "Blue Tang" to  Link Summon  " Marincess Blue Slug " (1500/LINK-1/↓) to the  Extra Monster Zone . As it was Link Summoned, the effect of "Blue Slug" lets her add a "Marincess" monster from her GY to her hand. She chooses "Sea Horse". As it was used as material for the Link Summon of a  WATER  monster, the effect of "Blue Tang" lets Blue Maiden  excavate  the top 3 cards of her Deck and add one excavated "Marincess" card to her hand: she adds " Marincess Basilalima " to her hand. Blue Maiden Special Summons "Sea Horse" (1400/1000) from her hand to the zone "Blue Slug" points to via its own effect, then uses "Blue Slug" and "Sea Horse" to Link Summon " Marincess Coral Anemone " (2000/LINK-2/←↓). She then activates the effect of "Coral Anemone"; targeting 1 WATER monster in her GY and Special Summoning it to the zone it points to. She Special Summons "Blue Slug". Blue Maiden then uses "Coral Anemone" and "Blue Slug" to Link Summon " Marincess Marbled Rock " (2500/LINK-3/←↓→). She then activates the effect of "Marbled Rock", letting her add 1 "Marincess" monster from her GY to her hand. She chooses "Blue Tang". Blue Maiden sets 2 cards.
 Turn 2: Ai 
Ai Normal Summons " Pikari @Ignister " (1200/600). As it was Summoned, its effect lets Ai add " Ignister A.I.Land " from his Deck to his hand. Ai then uses "Pikari" to Link Summon " Linguriboh " (300/LINK-1/↙) to the Extra Monster Zone. Ai activates the Field Spell "Ignister A.I.Land". As he controls no monsters in his Main Monster Zones, the effect of "AiLand" lets him Special Summon 1 Level 4 or lower " @Ignister " monster from his hand, but he can only Special Summon  Cyberse  monsters for the rest of the turn. Ai Special Summons " Achichi @Ignister " (800/800). As he controls a Link Monster in the Extra Monster Zone, Ai Special Summons " Hiyari @Ignister " (300/400) from his hand to the zone "Linguriboh" points to via its own effect. Ai uses "Achichi", "Hiyari" and the  DARK  "Linguriboh" to Link Summon " Dark Templar @Ignister " (2300/LINK-3/↙↓↘) to the Extra Monster Zone. As he controls no monsters in his Main Monster Zones, Ai activates the effect of "AiLand" again to Special Summon " Doyon @Ignister " (400/1600) in Attack Position to a Zone "Dark Templar" points to. As it was Summoned, the effect of "Doyon" lets Ai add 1 "@Ignister" monster from his GY to his hand. Ai adds "Hiyari". As a monster was summoned to a zone his Link Monster points to, the effect of "Dark Templar" lets Ai Special Summon as many Level 4 or lower "@Ignister" monsters as possible with different names from his GY to zones his Link Monster points to. Ai targets "Dark Templar" and Special Summons "Pikari" and "Achichi" to the remaining zones it points to. He then uses "Pikari", "Doyon" and the  FIRE  "Achichi" to Link Summon " Fire Phoenix @Ignister " (2300/LINK-3/←↓→) to a zone "Dark Templar" points to. Ai activates the  Link Spell  " Judgment Arrows " (↖↑↗) in the Spell/Trap Zone the bottom Link Arrow of "Fire Phoenix" points to.
 "Fire Phoenix" attacks "Marbled Rock", and as a Link Monster it points to is battling, the effect of "Judgment Arrows" doubles that monster's ATK during damage calculation only ("Fire Phoenix": 2300 → 4600 ATK). As it was attacked, Blue Maiden activates the effect of "Marbled Rock"; sending a "Marincess" monster from her hand to the GY to prevent her monsters from being destroyed by that battle and reducing all Battle Damage to 0. As she controls a Link-3 or higher "Marincess" Link Monster, Blue Maiden activates " Marincess Wave " from her hand, negating the effects of "Fire Phoenix" until the end of the turn as well as preventing her monsters from being affected by Ai's card effects this turn since she controls a Link-2 or higher "Marincess" Link Monster": Ai activates his  Quick-Play Spell  " TA.I.med Technique ", letting him target 1 "@Ignister" monster in the Extra Monster Zone and 1 Link Monster in the Main Monster Zones, banishing the second target, banishing an amount of cards from the opponent's hand equal to the banished monster's Link Rating and finally moving the first target to a Main Monster Zone. Ai targets "Dark Templar" and "Fire Phoenix", banishing the latter to banish 3 cards from Blue Maiden's hand and moving "Dark Templar" to a zone "Judgment Arrows" points to. "Dark Templar" attacks and destroys "Marbled Rock", with the effect of "Judgment Arrows" activating ("Dark Templar": 2300 → 4600 ATK) (Akira & Blue Maiden: 4000 → 1900 LP). At the end of the Battle Phase, "Fire Phoenix" and the cards banished from Blue Maiden's hand return from the Banished Zone. 
 Turn 3: Akira 
Akira sets a monster then activates the Continuous Spell Card " Stairs of Mail ", letting him send a " Tindangle " card from his hand to the GY to either change 1 face-down Defense Position monster he controls to face-up Attack Position or to change 1 face-up Attack Position monster he controls to face-down Defense Position. He activates the effect now, sending " Tindangle Intruder " from his hand to the GY to change his set " Tindangle Angel " (500/1800) to face-up Attack Position. As "Angel" was flipped face-up, Akira activates its effect to Special Summon a  Flip monster  from his hand or GY in face-down Defense Position. He Special Summons " Tindangle Hound " from his hand. As a monster was Special Summoned to his field in face-down Defense Position, Akira Special Summons "Intruder" from his GY in face-down Defense Position via its own effect. As a monster was Set on his field, Akira Special Summons " Tindangle Base Gardna " (0/2300) from his hand via its own effect. He activates the effect of "Stairs of Mail", sending an unknown "Tindangle" monster from his hand to the GY to change "Intruder" to face-up Attack Position (2200/0). As "Intruder" was flipped face-up, its effect lets Akira add a "Tindangle" card from his Deck to his hand. He activates the effect of "Stairs of Mail" again, sending an unknown "Tindangle" monster from his hand to the GY to change "Hound" to face-up Attack Position (2500/0). As "Hound" was flipped face-up, its effect lets Akira target 1 other face-up monster on the field, increase the ATK of "Hound" equal to that monster's original ATK and then change the targeted monster to face-down Defense Position. He targets "Intruder" ("Hound": 2500 → 4700 ATK). 
 "Hound" attacks and destroys "Dark Templar", with the effect of "Judgment Arrows" activating ("Dark Templar": 2300 → 4600 ATK; Ai: 4000 → 3900 LP). Akira then activates Blue Maiden's set " Marincess Decision ", banishing a "Marincess" card from the GY to change 1 face-down Defense Position monster to face-up Defense Position while negating its effects. Akira banishes "Wave" and targets "Intruder". The other effect of "Decision" lets Akira immediately Link Summon 1 monster using monsters he controls as materials, including the targeted monster. Akira uses "Angel", "Intruder" and "Base Gardna" to Link Summon " Tindangle Acute Cerberus " (0/LINK-3/↙↑↘) to the Extra Monster Zone.
