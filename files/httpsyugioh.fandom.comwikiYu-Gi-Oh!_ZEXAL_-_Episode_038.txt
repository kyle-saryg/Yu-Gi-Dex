 "Double Jeopardy: Part 2" , known as " Connect Hope! Hope Sword Mars Slash!! " in the Japanese version, is the thirty-eighth episode of the  Yu-Gi-Oh! ZEXAL  anime. It first aired in Japan on January 9, 2012, and in the United States on November 17, 2012.
 The Duel between  Yuma  against  Dextra  and  Nistro  continues. Due to their combination, Yuma is pushed into a corner, even after Summoning " Utopia " thanks to  Astral . However due to the bonds between the two, a reversal occurs!
 
 Featured Duel: Yuma Tsukumo vs. Dextra and Nistro 
 Duel continues from  the previous episode . 
 
 
 This Duel uses  Yu-Gi-Oh! ZEXAL  anime gameplay. Rules and  card effects  may differ from that of the  TCG / OCG . See the individual card articles for more information.     
 Turn 6: Nistro 
" Blade Bounzer "  attacks  " Gagaga Gardna ", but  Yuma   activates  the  effect  of the " Tasuke Knight " in his  Graveyard , reviving it ( 4/1700/100) in  Attack Position  and ending the  Battle Phase  as he has no cards in his hand.
 Turn 7: Yuma 
Yuma  draws  " Half Unbreak ". "Tasuke Knight" attacks and  destroys  " Morpho Butterspy " (Dextra: 4000 → 3500 LP). At this point,  Number 39: Utopia  adds himself to Yuma's Deck. Yuma  overlays  "Tasuke Knight" and "Gagaga Gardna" in order to  Xyz Summon  " Number 39: Utopia " ( 4/2500/2000, ORU: 2) in  Defense Position . Yuma  Sets  a card.
 Turn 8: Dextra 
 
                 Photon Butterfly Assassin   The Summoning of " Photon Papilloperative "     
 Dextra  draws. She then  Normal Summons  " Moonlit Papillon " ( 4/1200/1600) in Attack Position. Dextra then overlays " Swallowtail Butterspy " and "Moonlit Papillon" in order to Xyz Summon " Photon Papilloperative " ( 4/2100/1800, ORU: 2) in Attack Position. Dextra's hand contains " Monster Reincarnation " and " Insect Imitation ". Dextra activates the effect of "Photon Papilloperative",  detaching  an Overlay Unit ("Photon Papilloperative": 2 → 1 ORU) in order to switch "Utopia" to Attack Position and decrease its  ATK  by 600 ("Utopia": 2500 → 1900 ATK). 
 Dextra activates her  face-down  " Berserk Scales ", increasing the ATK of "Photon Papilloperative" by 1000 ("Photon Papilloperative": 2100 → 3100 ATK) but preventing it from attacking  directly . "Photon Papilloperative" attacks "Utopia", but Yuma activates the effect of "Utopia", detaching an Overlay Unit ("Utopia": 2 → 1 ORU) to  negate  the attack. On Dextra's  End Phase , the second effect of "Berserk Scales" decreases the ATK of "Photon Papilloperative" by 2000 ("Photon Papilloperative": 3100 → 1100 ATK).
 Turn 9: Nistro 
 
                 Photon Streak Bouncer   The Summoning of " Photon Strike Bounzer "     
 Nistro  draws. He then  Tributes  "Blade Bounzer" to  Tribute Summon  " Phantom Bounzer " ( 6/2400/1200) in Attack Position. Nistro overlays "Phantom Bounzer" and " Hammer Bounzer " in order to Xyz Summon " Photon Strike Bounzer " ( 6/2700/2000, ORU: 2) in Attack Position. 
 "Photon Strike Bounzer" attacks "Utopia", but Yuma activates the effect of "Utopia", detaching an Overlay Unit ("Utopia": 1 → 0 ORU) to negate the attack. As his opponent's  Xyz Monster  activated an effect, Nistro activates the effect of "Photon Strike Bounzer" to  negate  the effect of "Utopia" and inflict 1000  damage  to Yuma by detaching an Overlay Unit ("Photon Strike Bounzer": 2 → 1 ORU). Yuma activates his face-down " Damage Diet " to halve all effect damage he receives his  turn  (Yuma: 1000 → 500 LP). "Photon Strike Bounzer" continues its attack, but Yuma activates his face-down "Half Unbreak", to target "Utopia" in order to prevent it from being  destroyed by battle  this turn and halve all  Battle Damage  he would take from battles involving it (Yuma: 500 → 100 LP). Nistro Sets a card.
 Turn 10: Yuma 
 
         " Cardcar D " is Summoned.     
 Yuma draws " Cardcar D " and subsequently Normal Summons it ( 2/800/400) in Attack Position. Yuma activates the effect of "Cardcar D", Tributing it during the turn it is Summoned in order to draw two cards ("Double Tension" and " Double or Nothing! "), but preventing him from Special Summoning this turn. Yuma activates the effect of the " Overlay Eater " in his Graveyard,  banishing  it in order to  attach  an Overlay Unit from "Photon Strike Bounzer" ("Photon Strike Bounzer": 1 → 0 ORU) to "Utopia" ("Utopia": 0 → 1 ORU). 
 "Utopia" attacks "Photon Papilloperative", but Yuma activates the effect of "Utopia", detaching an Overlay Unit ("Utopia": 1 → 0 ORU) to negate the attack. As a monster's attack was negated, Yuma activates "Double or Nothing!" to double the ATK of "Utopia" ("Utopia": 1900 → 3800 ATK) and let it attack again. Yuma then activates " Double Tension " to double the ATK of "Utopia" ("Utopia": 3800 → 7600 ATK) as it is attacking for the second time in one turn. "Utopia" attacks "Photon Papilloperative", but Nistro activates his face-down " Bounzer Guard " to changing the target of the attack to "Photon Strike Bounzer" instead. "Utopia" then destroys "Photon Strike Bounzer" (Nistro: 4000 → 0 LP). 
 According to the  Tag Duel  rules used, as Nistro lost, Dextra is eliminated too and Yuma wins.
