 Biography 
 Arc League Championship 
 Olga defeated  Haruno Mihara  on the seventh day of the  Arc League Championship , during the second round, securing her place in the Top 16. [2]  On the day of the third round, Olga and the other contestants were informed that the third round would be a city-wide  Battle Royal , with participation determined by the  Pendulum Monsters  that the contestants found. [3] 
 Olga lured  Gong Strong  further into the Iceberg Area after seeing Gong get his second Pendulum Monster, and he challenged her to a Duel. The Duel went fairly evenly until they were interrupted when  Zuzu  crashed into her. Olga was angry at Zuzu for the intrusion. The Duel turned into a Battle Royal, with Zuzu paired with Gong, and Olga paired with  Halil . Olga proceeded to Summon her ace card, " Glacial Beast Iceberg Narwhal ", but she and Halil were defeated by Zuzu's " Bloom Diva the Melodious Choir ". [4] 
 After their Duel with Zuzu and Gong, Olga and Halil walked through the Jungle Area. They encountered  Trout  and  Reed Pepper  and challenged Reed to a Duel. [5]  Even though Olga Summoned her ace monster, Reed activated the  effects  of his " Royal Cookpals " to  destroy  his opponents' monsters, then used " Metabolic Storm " to inflict  damage  to them equal to the ATK of the destroyed monsters. As per the ante rules, Trout took the Pendulum cards that Olga and Halil wagered, much to their disgust, as Trout hadn't even Dueled. [6] 
 Later, Olga and Halil slid down an ice board on the Ice Field, nearly crashing into  Yuri  and  Dennis McField . The LID pair mistook Yuri for a Battle Royal participant and challenged him to a Duel. Yuri was irritated by their intrusion, but he accepted anyway. He defeated Olga and Halil and  sealed them   into cards , which he gave to Zuzu. [7] 
 
 Friendship Cup 
 When Zuzu and  Yugo  tried to warn  New Domino City 's residents about  Duel Academy 's invasion, Zuzu showed them the cards containing Halil and Olga, no one believed them. [8] 
 
 Duel Academy 
 After  Z-ARC 's defeat and the  Standard Dimension 's transformation into the  "Pendulum Dimension" , Olga was freed from her  card . [9]  She was later seen watching  Yuya Sakaki 's Duel against  Jack Atlas  with  Halil [10]  and applauded when Yuya won. She then watched Yuya and  Declan 's  Action Duel [11]  She was happy when Yuya won the Duel and witnessed  Zuzu 's revival. [12] 
 
 Deck 
 Olga uses an  Glacial Beast  Deck focused around  Synchro Summoning  her ace monster, " Glacial Beast Iceberg Narwhal ", which prevents her opponents from using  Spells  and  Traps  when it attacks, while also being able to double any  effect damage  her opponents take.
