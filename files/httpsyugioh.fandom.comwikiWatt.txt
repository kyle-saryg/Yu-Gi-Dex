 Visually, the basic monsters of this archetype are colorful, electrically-themed animals (except " Wattkid ", " Wattaildragon " and " Wattsychic Fighter ") while the  Synchro Monsters  are based on mythical creatures.
 
 Etymology 
 Each card's name starts with "Watt", and its Japanese name is a  portmanteau  of  Ereki  with another word that always contains the  katakana  キ  ki .

 Playing style 
 The "Watt" archetype consists of low ATK LIGHT monsters with effects mostly revolving around attacking and the Battle Phase. "Watts" have effects that activate after attacking directly, being destroyed by your opponent's cards, or just simply battling. These secondary effects can restrict the opponent's ability to activate effects, although many other types of effects also exist. The two main strategies of the Deck are: an aggressive Deck relying on the Level 4 "Watts" to inflict damage through direct attacks, or using a lockdown by assembling two face-up copies of " Watthopper ", which prevents the opponent from targeting all "Watt" monsters for attacks and card effects.

 Weaknesses 
 Archetypes and monsters like the " Ally of Justice " monsters benefit from the many LIGHT monsters "Watts" have. 
 King Tiger Wanghu  can shut down a "Watt" deck with its effect to destroy monsters Summoned with 1400 ATK or less. Other than the Synchro "Watt" monsters, "Watt" monsters have less than 1400 ATK, so they will be destroyed by his effect. 
 Since most "Watts" have effects that revolve around the Battle Phase, cards that prevent attacks, like the  Mirror Trap series  and  Battle Fader , can easily stop the deck. 
 Cards that negate effects, such as " Brain Golem " or " Skill Drain " can leave your "Watt" monsters useless. " Light-Imprisoning Mirror " hurts any Deck centered around  LIGHT  monsters. 
 " Spirit Barrier " prevents your opponent from taking battle damage while they control a monster. Since "Watt" monsters have low ATK, it can be difficult to deal with. 
 " Des Counterblow " destroys monsters after they inflict battle damage by attacking directly, so it can destroy some of your key "Watt" monsters.
