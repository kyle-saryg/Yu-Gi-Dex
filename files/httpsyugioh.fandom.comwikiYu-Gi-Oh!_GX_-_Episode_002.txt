 Summary 
 The new first year students arrived at  Duel Academy  via helicopter. They were gathered in the auditorium, where they met  Chancellor Sheppard . Sheppard congratulated them on their acceptance into Duel Academy and told them to settle into their assigned dorms. Both  Jaden  and  Syrus  were assigned to the  Slifer Red  dorm, while  Bastion  was placed in  Ra Yellow . Jaden and Syrus arrived at their dorm, with Syrus thinking that the building looks rundown, while Jaden commented that it provides a great view of the ocean. They found the top bunk of the room already occupied by  Chumley Huffington , who explained that he was held back last year. He explained how the dorm system works: The  Obelisk Blue  dorm is reserved for "elite" students who do very well on their entrance exams and have inside connections, while the  Ra Yellow  dorm is the middle-ground, housing students with successful exams. Finally, the Slifer Red dorm is where new students are placed, that the Academy feels have little potential.
 Afterward, Jaden and Syrus walked around the school a bit, and found the Duel arena where students can practice their dueling skills. Two Obelisk students named  Taiyou Torimaki  and  Raizou Mototani  were telling them to get lost because the arena is only to be used by Obelisk Blue students, but then one recognized Jaden as the student who  beat   Dr. Crowler . He called for  Chazz Princeton , the Obelisk Blue who watched Jaden Duel as well. Chazz bragged that Jaden wouldn’t stand a chance against him in a Duel, but  Alexis Rhodes  intervened, commenting that they would be late for their welcoming dinners, which ended up occurring.
 That night, each of the dorms had their own dinner. The Obelisks and Ras had a five-course meal, while the Slifers hardly had anything. They were then introduced to the headmaster,  Professor Banner  and his cat  Pharaoh , and then ate. Jaden later received a message from Chazz on his  PDA , telling Jaden to meet him in the Duel arena for an  Ante Duel . Jaden, along with Syrus, sneaked out to the arena to confront Chazz. Chazz was confident that he'll win, as he was the top student at his prep school.
 The Duel was interrupted by Alexis, who warned them that security is en route, as having a Duel after-hours in the arena is against the rules. The Duel ended prematurely and everyone sneaked out. Jaden revealed to Alexis he had just drawn " Monster Reborn ", which he would have used to revive his " Elemental HERO Flame Wingman " and to attack Chazz's " Mefist the Infernal Generall " to win the Duel. He is correct, as Chazz only had " Helpoemer " and " Pandemonium Watchbear " in his  hand , neither of which would have changed the outcome. [Notes 1] 
 
 Featured Duel: Jaden Yuki vs. Chazz Princeton 
 
 This Duel uses  Yu-Gi-Oh! GX  anime gameplay . Rules and  card effects  may differ from that of the  TCG / OCG . See the individual card articles for more information.     
 Turn 1: Chazz 
 Chazz   draws  " Chthonian Polymer ". Chazz's  hand  contains " Mefist the Infernal General ", " Call of the Haunted ", " Pandemonium Watchbear  ", " Helpoemer " and " Reborn Zombie ". He  Normal Summons  "Reborn Zombie" (1000/1600) in  Defense Position  and  Sets  a card.
 Turn 2: Jaden 
 Jaden  draws " Elemental HERO Avian ". Jaden's hand contains " Elemental HERO Burstinatrix ", " Elemental HERO Clayman ", " Elemental HERO Sparkman ", " Polymerization " and " Winged Kuriboh ". He  activates  "Polymerization" to  fuse  "Avian" and "Burstinatrix" to  Fusion Summon  " Elemental HERO Flame Wingman " (2100/1200) in  Attack Position . Since Jaden Fusion Summoned a  Fusion Monster , Chazz activates his  face-down  "Chthonian Polymer" to  Tribute  "Reborn Zombie" and take  control  of "Flame Wingman". Jaden Normal Summons "Clayman" (800/2000) in Defense Position.
 Turn 3: Chazz 
Chazz draws " Chthonian Soldier " and subsequently Normal Summons it (1200/1400) in Attack Position. "Flame Wingman"  attacks  and  destroys  "Clayman". The  effect  of "Flame Wingman" then activates, inflicting  damage  to Jaden equal to his destroyed monster's  ATK  (Jaden: 4000 → 3200 LP). "Chthonian Soldier" attacks  directly  (Jaden: 3200 → 2000 LP). Chazz Sets a card.
 Turn 4: Jaden 
Jaden draws. He then Normal Summons "Sparkman" (1600/1400) in Attack Position. "Sparkman" attacks and destroys "Chthonian Soldier" (Chazz: 4000 → 3600 LP). The effect of "Chthonian Soldier" then activates, inflicting damage to Jaden equal to the  Battle Damage  Chazz just took (Jaden: 2000 → 1600 LP). Jaden Sets a card.
 Turn 5: Chazz 
Chazz draws. "Flame Wingman" then attacks "Sparkman", but Jaden activates his face-down " Mirror Gate " to switch control of both battling monsters before  damage calculation . "Flame Wingman" destroys "Sparkman" (Chazz: 3600 → 3100 LP). The effect of "Flame Wingman" then activates (Chazz: 3100 → 1500 LP). Chazz then activates " Chthonian Blast " to destroy "Flame Wingman" and inflict damage to Jaden equal to half the ATK of "Flame Wingman" (Jaden: 1600 → 550 LP). He then activates his face-down " Call of the Haunted " to revive "Chthonian Soldier" (1200/1400) in Attack Position. Chazz Tributes "Chthonian Soldier" to  Tribute Summon  " Mefist the Infernal General " (1800/1700) in Attack Position.
 Turn 6: Jaden 
Jaden draws " Monster Reborn ".
 Before Jaden can make a move, the Duel ends with no result due to external influences.
 
 Errors 
 On the fifth turn, Chazz appeared to have drawn a monster, but that should have been "Chthonian Blast" due to what was in Chazz's opening hand.
