 In  episode 155 ,  Jaden Yuki  uses this card during his Duel against  Yubel . When " Yubel - The Ultimate Nightmare " attacks " Rainbow Neos ", Jaden activates this card to reduce the ATK of "Rainbow Neos" to 0 and prevent it from being destroyed by battle. Since "Yubel - The Ultimate Nightmare" can't be destroyed by battle, the attack ends in a stalemate. After damage calculation, this card's final effect banishes "Rainbow Neos" and allows Jaden to draw one card.
