 Summary 
 After defeating  Shark  and winning the  Team Duel Tournament ,  Yuma , along with  his team , gain a club room for them. However, when they get to the room, they find  a big man  who claims that room to be his. He and Yuma then begin a  Duel  for the room.
 
 Featured Duel: Yuma Tsukumo vs. Raizo Akuma 
 Turn 1: Yuma 
 Yuma 's opening  hand  contains " Goblindbergh ", " Gagaga Gardna ", " Gentlemander ", " Gagagadraw " and " Rank-Up-Magic Limited Barian's Force ". He  draws  " Gagaga Child ". Yuma  Normal Summons  "Gagaga Gardna" (1500/2000). As he  controls  a " Gagaga "  monster , he  Special Summons  "Gagaga Child" (800/1200) from his hand via its own  effect  and changes its  Level  to that of "Gardna", making it 4. He  overlays  his two Level 4 monsters to  Xyz Summon  " Maestroke the Symphony Djinn " (1800/2300) in  Defense Position .
 Turn 2: Raizo 
 Raizo 's opening hand contains " Archfiend Emperor, the First Lord of Horror ", " Summoned Skull ", " Skull Archfiend of Lightning ", " Falling Down " and " My Body as a Shield ". He draws " Archfiend Palabyrinth ". Raizo Normal Summons "Archfiend Emperor, the First Lord of Horror" without  Tribute  via its own effect, with its  ATK  and  DEF  being halved (3000/2000 → 1500/1000); it will also be destroyed at the  End Phase . He  activates  "Falling Down", taking  control  of Yuma's "Maestroke", and activates the  Field Spell Card  "Archfiend Palabyrinth". He activates the effect of "Archfiend Palabyrinth", letting him  banish  a  Fiend - Type  monster from his hand or  field  to target an " Archfiend " monster he controls and Special Summon another "Archfiend" monster of the same Level from his  Deck . He banishes "Maestroke" and targets "Archfiend Emperor" to Special Summon another "Archfiend Emperor" (3000/2000) from his Deck in Attack Position. The other effect of "Archfiend Palabyrinth" increase the ATK of all Fiend-Type monsters by 500 ("Archfiend Emperor" A 1500/1000 → 2000/1000, "Archfiend Emperor" B 3000/2000 → 3500/2000). "Genesis Archfiend" A  attacks   directly  (Yuma 4000 → 2000). "Genesis Archfiend" B attacks directly, but Yuma activates the effect of the " Gentlemander " in his hand, Special Summoning it Defense Position as his opponent has declared an attack. His opponent must target "Gentlemander" for the attack, so a  replay  occurs and "Archfiend Emperor" B attacks and destroys "Gentlemander". Raizo  Sets  a card. At the  End Phase , "Archfiend Emperor" A is destroyed via its own effect.
 Turn 3: Yuma 
Yuma draws " Gagaga Magician ". He Normal Summons "Goblindbergh" (1400/0), whose effect activates, letting him Special Summon a Level 4 or lower monster from his hand. He Special Summons "Gagaga Magician" (1500/1200). Yuma overlays his two Level 4 monsters to Xyz Summon " Number 39: Utopia " (2500/2000) in Attack Position. He then activates " Rank-Up-Magic Limited Barian's Force ", letting him target a  Rank  4  Xyz Monster  he controls and Special Summon a " Number C " monster from his  Extra Deck  one Rank higher than the target, using the target and its Xyz Materials as Xyz Materials for the "Number C". He targets "Utopia" and Special Summons " Number C39: Utopia Ray V " (2600/2000) in Attack Position. Yuma activates the effect of "Utopia Ray",  detaching  an Xyz Material to destroy one monster his opponent controls and inflict  damage  equal to the monster's ATK. He targets "Archfiend Emperor". As his opponent has activated an effect that would destroy a monster he controls, Raizo activates his  face-down  " My Body as a Shield ",  paying  1500  Life Points  (Raizo 4000 →  2500) to negate the activation and destroy the card. "Utopia Ray V" is destroyed. As it was destroyed, Yuma activates the effect of "Utopia Ray V", letting him  return  an Xyz Monster in his Graveyard to his  Extra Deck . He returns "Utopia" and activates "Gagagadraw", banishing three "Gagaga" monsters from his Graveyard to draw two cards. Yuma Sets two cards.
 Turn 4: Raizo 
Raizo activates the effect of "Archfiend Emperor", banishing an "Archfiend" card from his Graveyard to destroy one card on the field. He destroys one of Yuma's Set cards, which is " Jar of Greed ". Yuma  chains  it, drawing a card. "Archfiend Emperor" attacks directly, but Yuma activates his face-down " Pinpoint Guard ", letting him Special Summon a Level 4 or lower monster from his Graveyard, which cannot be  destroyed by battle  or card effects this turn. He Special Summons "Goblindbergh" (1400/0) in Defense Position.
 Turn 5: Yuma 
Yuma draws " Rank-Up-Magic Numeron Force ". He Normal Summons " Tatakawa Knight " (1500/0). He overlays his two Level 4 monsters to Xyz Summon "Utopia" (2500/2000) in Attack Position. Yuma activates "Numeron Force", letting him target an Xyz Monster he controls and Special Summon a "Number C" monster of the same Type but one Rank higher from his Extra Deck, using the Xyz Monster and its Xyz Materials as Xyz Materials for the "Number C". He targets "Utopia" and Special Summons " Number C39: Utopia Ray Victory " (2800/2500) in Attack Position. "Numeron Force"  negates  the effects of all cards on the field besides "Utopia Ray Victory". "Victory" attack "Archfiend Emperor". As "Victory" has an " Utopia " monster  attached  to it as an Xyz Material, Yuma activates the effect of "Victory", detaching an Xyz Material to negate the effects of "Archfiend Emperor" and increase the ATK of "Victory" by its ATK ("Victory" 2800 → 5800). The attack continues and "Archfiend Emperor" is destroyed (Raizo 2500 →  0).
