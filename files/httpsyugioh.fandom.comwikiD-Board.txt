A  D-Board  ( Ｄ ・ボード  Dī Bōdo ) [1]  is a type of hoverboard introduced in the  Yu-Gi-Oh! VRAINS  anime. It is designed for  Speed Duels  inside  LINK VRAINS . When a Duel is about to begin within the  Data Storm , the D-Boards will appear from within the wind for the Duelists to jump onto. The D-Boards can also be used as a form of transportation inside LINK VRAINS when Data Storm winds are present, [2]  and will disappear as necessary when their owner no longer has the intent of riding the Data Storm winds.
