 History 
 At some point,  Kite Tenjo  acquired a Baria Crystal, which he used as a new power source for  Orbital 7 . Later, after he and Orbital 7 stole  Yuma's key  and found that no substance native to Earth could affect it, Kite suggested they try using the Baria Crystal on it. Using it, they successfully opened a portal, allowing Kite to enter the world inside the Key. [1] 
 Within the chamber where  Dumon ,  Girag ,  Mizar  and  Alito  meet in  Barian World , many of these crystals are present. Before leaving for Earth, Girag crushes one with only his fist. [2]  The crystals serve as devices that can be used to monitor Earth. Using them, Dumon witnessed Girag's failures, prompting his decision to send Alito to Earth too. [3] 
 The crystals also have healing properties, seen when Girag and Alito were resting inside them to heal after being defeated by Yuma. [4] 
 The crystal that powered Orbital 7 was later used to erect an energy shield to protect Kite in his Duel with  Mizar  on the Moon. [5] 
 A Baria Crystal was made as the cocoon of Don Thousand, from which he revealed his true form.  [6]
