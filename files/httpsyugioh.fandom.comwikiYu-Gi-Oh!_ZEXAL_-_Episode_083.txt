 Summary 
 Mizar  has just summoned " Number 107: Galaxy-Eyes Tachyon Dragon ". Shocked,  Yuma  exclaims that he thought there were only 100 " Numbers ". Astral confirms this; his memories had been split into 100 pieces. He wonders just what this "Number" is as he stares at it in stunned horror. (In the dub, Astral says Number 107 "should not exist".) Outside the  Sphere Field ,  Tori  turns as  Shark  and  Rio  arrive on Shark's motorcycle. Shark notices the Sphere Field and comments on how the duel has already begun. (in the dub, he wonders what monster Yuma is facing) Rio asks Tori what is happening. (this part is omitted from the dub)
 Up above, Mizar notices that "Galaxy-Eyes Tachyon Dragon" is acting rather restless, and wonders if it really wants to fight that badly. (this part is omitted from the dub) Stating that he will fulfill its wish, he commands the "Number" to attack " Utopia ". Yuma defends by activating the effect of "Utopia", with Astral commenting on the strength of  Light Wing Shield  and " Overlay Chain " together. With a smirk, Mizar asks if they really think they will survive like that. A startled Yuma states that Mizar's Battle Phase ought to have ended; Mizar simply comments on Yuma's naivety before activating the effect of "Tachyon Dragon": once per turn, when all possible attacks have been used up, he can detach an  Overlay Unit  from "Tachyon Dragon" to negate the effects of all other monsters on the field and return their ATK and DEF to normal.
 
       Mizar  using "Tachyon Dragon"s effect.     
 Applying " Tachyon Transmigration ", "Tachyon Dragon" reverts to its sealed form and emits a rainbow aura which forces "Utopia" back into its own sealed form. A shocked Astral and Yuma bear witness to the remaining parts of the effect of "Tachyon Dragon": if a card or effect was activated during this Battle Phase, then "Tachyon Dragon" gains 1000 ATK. Also, Mizar states that during the turn in which this effect is activated, "Galaxy-Eyes Tachyon Dragon" can attack an additional time. A horrified Astral realizes the implications of a monster that can alter both the past and future to its own advantage (in the dub, Astral tells Yuma to double their efforts and Duel like never before if they want to win). Mizar commands "Tachyon Dragon" to attack with " Tachyon Spiral of Destruction ". Astral begins to warn Yuma about the attack, but before he can elaborate, "Utopia" is obliterated and Yuma is hurled painfully into the Sphere Field, which shocks him on impact.
 
       Yuma being electrified by the  Barian Sphere Field .     
 Tori calls out Yuma's name as Shark grits his teeth in anger. Astral pleads for Yuma to wake up as Mizar comments on how weak humans are, noting how much damage Yuma received from just one attack of "Tachyon Dragon". (in the dub, Astral asks if Yuma is hurt badly. Mizar replies that he is and that he is nearly broken after a single attack from "Tachyon Dragon") Yuma struggles to rise, and Mizar encourages him to do so, noting how he is just a nuisance if he does not continue. He orders Yuma to "stand up, lose miserably, and hand over [his] "Numbers" to [him]." (in the dub, Mizar encourages Yuma to rise, and he can knock him down again, while adding that Yuma should think about how "Utopia" slipped away from him.) Yuma attempts to respond, but he stumbles, and Mizar continues to mock him, asking if he cannot even stand up. (in the dub, Mizar taunts Yuma, saying that he is depriving him of his sport, and that challenging humans is a rare treat) He then offers him the chance to surrender, which Yuma refuses, knowing that if he loses, he will lose Astral as well, which he cannot accept. He then falls unconscious.

 Shark resolves to take Yuma's place in the duel, but before he can do so,  Kite  flies in on  Orbital 7  and declares that he will take Yuma's place. Shark begins to tell Kite to stay out of this, but then Rio, glowing red, seems to fall into a trance, notes that "Galaxy-Eyes" is calling on "Galaxy-Eyes". Shark listens as Rio elaborates that the two dragons, which have encountered once before, are drawn together once again after transcending distant dimensions. Shark notes that she said  two  dragons.
 
         Kite takes Yuma's position.     
 Mizar notices something different about Kite. At that moment, a silhouette of " Galaxy-Eyes Photon Dragon " appears and roars, which its Tachyon "brother" responds to. The Sphere Field begins to react to the presence of both dragons and teleports Kite in. Yuma opens his eyes and murmurs Kite's name. Kite tells the two to leave the rest to him, to which Astral apologizes. Kite replies that he shouldn't worry; this is his issue as well. "There can only be one person who uses Galaxy-Eyes," he states, "and that person is me." Mizar asks if he's finished his greeting to "that loser." Kite states that if Mizar welcomed him here, then he also wants to fight him. (in the dub, Mizar asserts that he is the true "Galaxy-Eyes" master, while Kite replies that Mizar made two mistakes: underestimating his confidence and bringing him to the Sphere Field) Mizar corrects him, stating that his "Galaxy-Eyes" challenged Kite's. Kite then asks if he has no objections to him taking Yuma's place; Mizar affirms that he has none. Mizar Sets two cards and ends his turn, with the ATK of "Tachyon Dragon" returning to normal.
 
         The two "Galaxy-Eyes" send out shockwaves.     
 Kite now begins his turn continuing with Yuma's remaining 2500 Life Points. He plays " Photon Trade " discarding a " Photon " monster and drawing two cards before Special Summoning " Photon Thrasher " as he controls no monsters. Then he Normal Summons " Photon Crusher ". Shark and Rio note that Kite hs two monsters with at least 2000 ATK points, and Kite Tributes his two monsters with 2000 or more ATK to Special Summon "Galaxy-Eyes Photon Dragon". Both monsters send out shockwaves that, as Rio explains, resonate with each other. Astral is quite surprised at the two monsters. The shockwaves eventually damage the ground, causing large chasms to open up. Orbital 7 comments that the phenomenon is incomprehensible. Meanwhile, unseen by the others,  Ray  approaches on a hillside to watch the Duel.
 As both players witness the animosity between their two monsters, Mizar comments on how the legend appears to be correct. (in the dub, Mizar says that having two "Galaxy-Eyes" monsters is as rare as it is risky) Kite asks what he means, but Mizar replies that a loser such as Kite doesn't need to know about it. Kite decides to win to get his answer and declares the attack of "Photon Dragon", then activates its effect to banish both monsters, sending the last Overlay Unit of "Tachyon Dragon" to the Graveyard. At the end of the battle, both monsters are Special Summoned as Kite explains that "Photon Dragon" will gain 500 ATK for each Overlay Unit that "Tachyon Dragon" had. "Photon Dragon" absorbs the Overlay Unit as its ATK rises to 3500.
 Kite comments that removing the Overlay Unit from "Tachyon Dragon" has pulled out its fangs. Mizar asks if that's so, and activates his Set " Instant Overlay ", allowing him to attach it to an Xyz Monster that has no Overlay Units. He comments that it's a pity, and then activates the effect of "Tachyon Dragon", detaching an Overlay Unit to negate the effects of all other monsters on the field and return their ATK and DEF to normal. "Tachyon Dragon" reverts to its sealed form as Mizar declares "Tachyon Transmigration!" "Photon Dragon" loses its blue light as the rainbow aura of "Tachyon Dragon", which returns to its dragon form, negates the effect of "Photon Dragon" and returns it to its base 3000 ATK. Since Mizar activated "Instant Overlay," "Tachyon Dragon" also gains 1000 ATK. Kite knows that he can't use the effect of "Photon Dragon" anymore, but thinks that he can use " Lumenize " to protect "Photon Dragon". He wonders if this will decide it, and Sets the card to end his turn, also returning the ATK of "Tachyon Dragon" to 3000.
 Mizar draws and activates " Energy Attractor ", allowing him to use it and Kite's Set card as "Tachyon Dragon's" Overlay Units. Red beams strike the Set "Lumenize", transforming it into the twin Overlay Units which come to rest around "Tachyon Dragon." Mizar remarks that judging by the look on Kite's face, he's lost his trump card to reverse the situation. Astral adds that "Tachyon Dragon" now has two Overlay Units. Mizar then attacks, activating " Tachyon Drive ", which allows him to prevent other Spell and Trap cards from affecting a "Tachyon Dragon" monster. "Tachyon Dragon" attacks, destroying "Photon Dragon," as Kite grimly reflects that "Numbers" can only be destroyed by other "Numbers". (in the dub, Kite remarks that even though his "Photon Dragon" was taken out, it will rise again and it will be Mizar who will fall) Mizar then activates the effect of "Tachyon Dragon," and it uses "Tachyon Transmigration" again. Shark curses that Mizar used the effect again. Due to its effect, as Mizar activated "Tachyon Drive", "Tachyon Dragon gains 1000 ATK and it can attack a second time.
 Outside the Sphere Field, Rio observes that "Tachyon Drive" not only protects "Tachyon Dragon," but allows it to crush the opponent. Shark mutters that this is bad. (this part is cut from the dub) Mizar tells Kite that he should feel honoured to meet his end at "this noble dragon's claws" (in the dub, Mizar tells Kite that he will end his deranged hopes of winning) and declares a direct attack with "Tachyon Spiral of Annihilation". The attack strikes Kite, who disappears behind a cloud of smoke. Yuma whispers Kite's name as Mizar declares himself the true "Galaxy-Eyes" user, (in the dub, Mizar says that Kite failed his "Galaxy-Eyes" once again) only for the smoke to clear to reveal Kite, Life Points at 500.
 Mizar is horrified, and asks how Kite survived, then the smoke clears further to reveal "Galaxy-Eyes Photon Dragon". Kite explains that he activated the effect of " Photon Specter " from his Graveyard (sent there via "Photon Trade"), pointing out that "Tachyon Drive" only affects Spell and Trap Cards. It allowed him to Special Summon a " Photon " monster from his Graveyard in Attack Position with its effects negated and its ATK reduced by 1000, as well as preventing the monster from being destroyed in battle during the turn it was Summoned. Thus, the attack targeted "Photon Dragon," with 2000 ATK, so Kite's total damage was 2000. Mizar is disgruntled, but ends his turn, and the ATK of "Tachyon Dragon" returns to normal.
 
         Mizar meets the "Numbers" killer.     
 Kite's Duel Gazer tattoo glows as he draws. He activates " Monster Reborn " to revive "Photon Thrasher," and Normal Summons "Photon Circle". Then he activates " Upshift ", raising the Levels of all the monsters on his field to that of the one with the highest Level - 8. Noting that Kite has three Level 8 monsters, Mizar wonders if it's coming. Kite screams as a red aura surronds him, and he overlays the three monsters to Xyz Summon " Neo Galaxy-Eyes Photon Dragon ." Observing the gigantic dragon, Mizar whispers in anticipation. Kite uses the effect of "Neo Photon" to negate the effects of every other face-up card on the field as it was Xyz Summoned using "Galaxy-Eyes Photon Dragon" as Xyz Material, declaring "Photon Howling". Mizar realizes that this effect has taken away the immunity to destruction by non-Numbers of his "Number", and wonders if this is why it's regarded as a fearsome "Numbers killer." Kite then activates the effect of "Neo Photon", detaching an Overlay Unit to detach the Overlay Units from all other Xyz Monsters on the field, and then gaining 500 ATK for each one. "Neo Photon" powers up to 5000 ATK, and Kite declares its attack with "Ultimate Photon Stream of Destruction". The blast destroys "Tachyon Dragon" in a massive explosion, which blasts Mizar into the Sphere Field, reducing his Life Points to 2000. Kite ends his turn. Mizar begins to laugh, calling Kite very good - that's what a Galaxy-Eyes user should be. (this part is cut from the dub)
 
         Mizar showing this true  Barian  form.     
Mizar draws, asking Kite to let him use this card as well. He plays his own "Monster Reborn", reviving "Number 107: Galaxy-Eyes Tachyon Dragon". Both it and "Neo Galaxy-Eyes Photon Dragon" roar at each other. Mizar grins - if it comes to this, it is only fitting that he fight for real. He declares  Barian Battlemorph , and glows with light, transforming into his  true form . Down below, everyone looks at the Barian in shock, as Astral and Kite observe Mizar's true form.          Mizar summoning " Neo Galaxy-Eyes Tachyon Dragon ".     Mizar says that he'll show them the true power of Barian, and activates " Rank-Up-Magic Barian's Force ", allowing him to use an Xyz Monster as an Overlay Unit to summon a " CXyz " monster". Using "Tachyon Dragon" as Xyz Material, he chants "The power of Barian, born from Chaos, dwell in the Numbers to create a new Chaos!" Astral and Kite look on in shock as Mizar declares a " Chaos Xyz Evolution ", and a door resembling the Barian emblem appears as Mizar chants "Pierce through the galaxy and revive from before the creation of time!" As the door shatters open, he yells, "Surpass the eternal dragon's star! " Chaos Number 107! Neo Galaxy-Eyes Tachyon Dragon! " (in the dub, Mizar chants "Barian power born from chaos, surge through my Number and bestow it with great might! Go Chaos Xyz Evolution! Face the multiverse and ignite new life into my great beast!") The evolved "Tachyon Dragon", a three headed dragon wreathed in flames, roars as it appears (its ATK value unseen).
         " Neo Galaxy-Eyes Tachyon Dragon " threatens to destroy the field.     
 Kite is shocked to see a "Neo Galaxy Eyes" form of "Tachyon Dragon". Both dragons roar at each other, and Mizar protests that it's not working - there's too much energy. The energy from "Neo Galaxy-Eyes Tachyon Dragon" begins to engulf the Sphere Field and forces Mizar back into his human form, who tells Kite to save to duel for later, and he tells him his name. He vows to control both "Galaxy-Eyes" one day, and vanishes in the smoke. The Sphere Field begins to break up, and Tori cries out Yuma's name. Kite's red aura fades as the field dismisses itself entirely, and he and Yuma begin to fall. Orbital 7, transforming into his glider form, swoops in and rescues Kite, while Shark runs to save Yuma, who hits the ground and rolls towards the chasm that the two "Galaxy-Eyes" monsters created. Shark grabs Yuma as Yuma falls over the edge, but it breaks under Shark's weight, and they fall screaming into the chasm, with Tori, Rio, Astral and Kite looking on in horror.
 
 Featured Duels 
 Yuma Tsukumo vs. Mizar 
 Duel continues from  the previous episode . 
 Turn 2: Mizar 
" Number 107: Galaxy-Eyes Tachyon Dragon "  attacks  " Number 39: Utopia ", but  Yuma   activates  the  effect  of "Utopia",  detaching  an  Overlay Unit  ("Utopia": 2 → 1 ORU) to  negate  the attack. Mizar activates the effect of "Galaxy-Eyes Tachyon Dragon", detaching an Overlay Unit [Notes 1]  ("Galaxy-Eyes Tachyon Dragon": 2 → 1 ORU) to negate the effects of all other face-up  monsters  on the  field , increase the ATK of "Galaxy-Eyes Tachyon Dragon" by 1000 for each card effect that  resolved  during the  Battle Phase  ("Galaxy-Eyes Tachyon Dragon": 3000 → 4000 ATK), and allow it to attack again. "Galaxy-Eyes Tachyon Dragon" attacks and  destroys  "Utopia" (Yuma: 4000 → 2500 LP). 
 Yuma gets badly injured from colliding with the Sphere Field, rendering him unable to continue the Duel, so  Kite  takes his place and continues the Duel with Yuma's remaining 2500  Life Points .
 
 Kite Tenjo vs. Mizar 
 Turn 2: Mizar 
Mizar  Sets  a card. On Mizar's End Phase, the effect of "Galaxy-Eyes Tachyon Dragon" expires ("Galaxy-Eyes Tachyon Dragon": 4000 → 3000 ATK).
 Turn 3: Kite 
 Kite  draws. He then  activates  " Photon Trade " to  draw  two cards by sending " Photon Specter " (a " Photon "  monster ) from his  hand  to the  Graveyard  (Kite draws " Photon Thrasher " and " Lumenize "). As he  controls  no monsters, he  Special Summons  "Photon Thrasher" ( 4/2100/0) in  Attack Position  via its own effect. He then  Normal Summons  " Photon Crusher " ( 4/2000/0) in Attack Position. Kite  Tributes  "Photon Thrasher" and "Photon Crusher" in order to Special Summon " Galaxy-Eyes Photon Dragon " ( 8/3000/2500) from in Attack Position via its own effect (as the Tributed monsters had at least 2000 ATK). 
 "Galaxy-Eyes Photon Dragon" attacks "Galaxy-Eyes Tachyon Dragon" and Kite activates the second effect of "Galaxy-Eyes Photon Dragon" to  banish  both monsters. At the end of the  Battle Phase , both "Galaxy-Eyes Photon Dragon" ( 8/3000/2500) and "Galaxy-Eyes Tachyon Dragon" ( 8/3000/2500) are Special Summoned from the Banished Zone in Attack Position. Due to the last effect of "Galaxy-Eyes Photon Dragon", it gains 500 ATK for every Overlay Unit that was sent to the Graveyard via its third effect ("Galaxy-Eyes Photon Dragon": 3000 → 3500 ATK). 
 Mizar activates his face-down " Instant Overlay " to  attach  this card as an Overlay Unit to "Galaxy-Eyes Tachyon Dragon" as it doesn't have any Overlay Units ("Galaxy-Eyes Tachyon Dragon": 0 → 1 ORU). He then activates the effect of "Galaxy-Eyes Tachyon Dragon" to detach "Instant Overlay" ("Galaxy-Eyes Tachyon Dragon": 1 → 0 ORU), negate the effects of "Galaxy-Eyes Photon Dragon" and return its ATK to its original value ("Galaxy-Eyes Photon Dragon": 3500 → 3000 ATK). Kite's hand contains " Photon Circle ", "Lumenize" and " Upshift ". Kite Sets a card ("Lumenize").
 Turn 4: Mizar 
Mizar draws. He then activates " Energy Attractor " to  target  "Galaxy-Eyes Tachyon Dragon" (as it has no Overlay Units) and attach "Energy Attractor" and Kite's set card to "Galaxy-Eyes Tachyon Dragon" as Overlay Units ("Galaxy-Eyes Tachyon Dragon" 0 → 2 ORU), but he may not Normal or Special Summon this this turn. "Galaxy-Eyes Tachyon Dragon" attacks "Galaxy-Eyes Photon Dragon" and Mizar activates " Tachyon Drive " to make "Galaxy-Eyes Tachyon Dragon" (a "Tachyon Dragon" monster) immune to  Spell / Trap Cards  this turn. Only "Galaxy-Eyes Photon Dragon" is destroyed as it was not a " Number " monster. 
 Mizar then activates the effect of "Galaxy-Eyes Tachyon Dragon" ("Galaxy-Eyes Tachyon Dragon": 2 → 1 ORU; 3000 → 4000 ATK) in order to let it attack again. "Galaxy-Eyes Tachyon Dragon" attacks  directly , but Kite activates the effect of the "Photon Specter" in his  Graveyard , banishing it in order to revive "Galaxy-Eyes Photon Dragon" (a "Photon" monster) with its ATK reduced by 1000 and its effects negated as well as grant "Galaxy-Eyes Photon Dragon" immunity to destruction  by battle  this turn ( 8/3000 → 2000/2500). A replay occurs, and Mizar uses "Galaxy-Eyes Tachyon Dragon" to attack "Galaxy-Eyes Photon Dragon", but the latter isn't destroyed (Kite: 2500 → 500 LP). On Mizar's End Phase, the effect of "Galaxy-Eyes Tachyon Dragon" expires ("Galaxy-Eyes Tachyon Dragon": 4000 → 3000 ATK).
 Turn 5: Kite 
Kite draws " Monster Reborn " and subsequently activates it to revive "Photon Thrasher" ( 4/2100/0) in Attack Position. He then Normal Summons "Photon Circle" ( 4/1000/1000) in Attack Position. Kite then activates "Upshift" to target "Galaxy-Eyes Photon Dragon" and make the Levels of all other face-up monsters he control become the same Level as "Galaxy-Eyes Photon Dragon" ("Photon Circle" and "Photon Thrasher":   3 → 4). Kite then overlays "Galaxy-Eyes Photon Dragon", "Photon Circle", and "Photon Thrasher" in order to Xyz Summon " Neo Galaxy-Eyes Photon Dragon " ( 8/4500/3000, ORU: 3) in Attack Position. 
 Since "Galaxy-Eyes Photon Dragon" was used for the Xyz Summon of "Neo Galaxy-Eyes Photon Dragon", Kite activates the latter monster's first effect to negate the effects of all other face-up monsters. Kite then activates the second effect of "Neo Galaxy-Eyes Photon Dragon", detaching an Overlay Unit ("Neo Galaxy-Eyes Photon Dragon": 3 → 2 ORU) to send all Overlay Units attached to "Galaxy-Eyes Tachyon Dragon" to the Graveyard ("Galaxy-Eyes Tachyon Dragon": 1 → 0 ORU), increase the ATK of "Neo Galaxy-Eyes Photon Dragon" by 500 for each one ("Neo Galaxy-Eyes Photon Dragon": 4500 → 5000 ATK) and give it one attack for each Overlay Unit sent to the Graveyard  (thus only getting to attack once, just like in a normal situation) . "Neo Galaxy-Eyes Photon Dragon" attacks and destroys "Galaxy-Eyes Tachyon Dragon" (Mizar: 4000 → 2000 LP).
 Turn 6: Mizar 
Mizar draws. He then activates "Monster Reborn" to revive "Galaxy-Eyes Tachyon Dragon" ( 8/3000/2500) in Attack Position. Mizar activates " Rank-Up-Magic Barian's Force " to  Rank-Up  "Galaxy-Eyes Tachyon Dragon" via  Chaos Xyz Evolution  in order to Xyz Summon " Chaos Number 107: Neo Galaxy-Eyes Tachyon Dragon " ( 9/4500/3000, ORU: 1). The power of "Neo Galaxy-Eyes Tachyon Dragon" threatens to destroy the  Barian Sphere Cube , so Mizar cancels the Duel.
 
 Errors 
 When  Mizar  constructed the  Overlay Network  using " Rank-Up-Magic Barian's Force " to  Rank-Up   Number 107: Galaxy-Eyes Tachyon Dragon , he stated he was constructing it with two monsters, instead of 1. This is corrected in the dub. 
 When " Number 107: Galaxy-Eyes Tachyon Dragon " finished using its  effect  against " Galaxy-Eyes Photon Dragon " it is still shown to have 1  Overlay Unit , when it should have had none. 
 When  Kite  looks at his  hand  after "Tachyon Dragon" used its effect, the cards have the old  card backings . This was corrected in the dub.
