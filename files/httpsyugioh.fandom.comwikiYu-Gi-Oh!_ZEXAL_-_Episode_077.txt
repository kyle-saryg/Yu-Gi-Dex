 " Rule Duel ", known as " Disorderly Duels Are Against School Rules!? Sally Forth! Special Disciplinary Commander " in the Japanese version, is the seventy-seventh episode of the  Yu-Gi-Oh! ZEXAL  anime. It first aired in Japan on October 28, 2012 and in the United States on September 7, 2013.
 Yuma 's been appointed Class Representative! While Yuma is quite eager and willing to do the job,  Caswell Francis , known by all as "Class Representative", has mixed feelings about this. The  Student Council President  appears before Caswell, appointing him as the "Chief Disciplinarian". The Chief Disciplinarian's job is to crack down on violations of school rules, which ends up angering a lot of students at the academy. In order to stop this ridiculous system, Yuma challenges the Student Council President, who turns out to be under  Barian  control, to a Duel!

 Featured Duel: Yuma Tsukumo vs. Carlyle Chesterton 
 
 This Duel uses  Yu-Gi-Oh! ZEXAL  anime gameplay. Rules and  card effects  may differ from that of the  TCG / OCG . See the individual card articles for more information.     
 For this duel,  Caswell Francis  may return cards to a player's hand. 
 Turn 1: Yuma 
 Yuma  draws. He then  Normal Summons  " Gagaga Magician " ( 4/1500/1000) in Attack Position. Caswell returns "Gagaga Magician" to Yuma's hand as its attire is a violation of the school's dress code. Yuma  Sets  a card.
 Turn 2: Carlyle 
 Carlyle  draws " Mirror Stage of Discipline " and subsequently activates it. Now the  ATK  and  DEF  of all of Carlyle's  face-up   monsters  will remain at their  original values . He then Normal Summons " Tamagushi the Righteous " without  Tribute  via its own  effect  by reducing its ATK to 0, however "Mirror Stage of Discipline" prevents the ATK of "Tamagushi" from decreasing ( 6/1000/2200). As he  controls  a " Priestess " monster, Carlyle  Special Summons  " Sakaki the Honor Student " ( 6/1600/1200) in  Attack Position  via its own effect, though it may not  attack  this  turn . 
 Carlyle  overlays  "Tamagushi" and "Sakaki" in order to  Xyz Summon  " Norito the Moral Leader " ( 6/2700/2000, ORU: 2) in Attack Position. "Norito the Moral Leader" attacks  directly , but Yuma activates his  face-down  " Impenetrable Attack " to reduce the  Battle Damage  he would take to 0. Carlyle then activates the effect of "Norito the Moral Leader" to negate and destroy "Impenetrable Attack" by  detaching  an  Overlay Unit  ("Norito the Moral Leader": 2 → 1 ORU). The direct attack continues (Yuma: 4000 → 1300 LP). Carlyle Sets a card.
 Turn 3: Yuma  
Yuma draws. He then Sets a monster. Carlyle activates his face-down " Surprise Inspection " to switch Yuma's set " Gagaga Girl " ( 3/1000/800) in Attack Position. This would be a violation of the dress code, so Caswell moves to return "Gagaga Girl" to Yuma's hand. Yuma activates " Clear Robe " to reduce the ATK and DEF of "Gagaga Girl" to 0 in order to prevent it from  leaving the field , but Carlyle activates the effect of "Norito the Moral Leader" to negate and destroy "Clear Robe" ("Norito the Moral Leader": 1 → 0 ORU). Therefore, Caswell's ruling stands and "Gagaga Girl" returns to Yuma's hand. As Yuma controls no monsters and the effect of a Spell/Trap Card he used was negated, Yuma activates the effect of " Tatakawa Knight " to inflict 1500 damage to Carlyle by sending "Tatakawa Knight" from his hand to the  Graveyard  (Carlyle: 4000 → 2500 LP). Yuma activates " Monster Reborn " to revive "Tamagushi" ( 6/1000/2200) in Defense Position and under his control. Yuma Sets a card.
 Turn 4: Carlyle 
At this point, Carlyle tries to get Caswell to negate the effects of "Tatakawa Knight" and "Monster Reborn" due to them being acts of school violence and stealing respectively, however Caswell finds these declarations unreasonable and unjustified. After a conversation with Yuma, Caswell stops the ruling, so the duel will be conducted as a Normal Duel from this point. 
 Carlyle  draws  " Rank-Up-Magic Barian's Force " and subsequently activates it to  Rank-Up  "Norito the Moral Leader" via  Chaos Xyz Evolution  in order to Xyz Summon " Chaos Xyz Simon the Great Moral Leader " ( 7/3000/2500, ORU: 1) in Attack Position. Carlyle activates the effect of "Simon the Great Moral Leader" to detach "Norito the Moral Leader" ("Simon the Great Moral Leader": 1 → 0 ORU) and switch "Tamagushi" to Attack Position. "Simon the Great Moral Leader" attacks "Tamagushi", but Yuma activates his face-down " Half Unbreak " to prevent the destruction of "Tamagushi"  by battle  and halve the Battle Damage he takes (Yuma: 1300 → 300 LP). As "Simon the Great Moral Leader" battled and its  target  was not destroyed by battle, Carlyle activates " Double Check " to destroy "Tamagushi". 
 Turn 5: Yuma 
Yuma draws "Gagagawind". He then Normal Summons "Gagaga Magician" ( 4/1500/1000) in Attack Position. Yuma then activates " Gagagawind " to Special Summon "Gagaga Girl" (as it's a "Gagaga" monster) in Attack Position with its Level increased by one ( 3 → 4/1000/800). Yuma then overlays "Gagaga Magician" and "Gagaga Girl" in order to Xyz Summon " Number 39: Utopia " ( 4/2500/2000, ORU: 2) in Attack Position. As "Gagaga Girl" was used as an Overlay Unit for an Xyz Summon with another "Gagaga" monster, Yuma activates the effect of "Gagaga Girl" in order to reduce the original ATK of "Simon the Great Moral Leader" to 0 ("Simon the Great Moral Leader": 3000 → 0 ATK). "Utopia" attacks and destroys "Simon the Great Moral Leader" (Carlyle: 2500 → 0 LP).

 Mistakes 
         Incorrect  card backings .     
 In the original, when " Gagaga Girl "  returns  to  Yuma 's hand, his  hand  contains the  card backings  used in the previous series. This was corrected in the dub. 
 When Carlyle activates  Rank-Up-Magic Barian's Force , his  Duel Gazer  Disappears. 
 Differences in adaptations 
 The skirt length differences of " Tamagushi the Righteous " are removed from the dub. However, "Tamagushi" still blushes. 
 " Gagaga Girl " running toward " Gagaga Magician " is cut from the dub. 
 Caswell  helping  Spencer  in a flashback is cut from the dub. 
 Caswell's ruling of  Tori 's,  Summer 's, and  Jen 's skirts being too short is changed to "No gossiping!". However, they are still seen blushing.
