 Summary 
 Present 
 Akiza  and  Crow  watch as their  Planetary Gear  stops. The walls created by  Sherry's  " Soul-Binding Gate " begin to crumble, causing Sherry to fall. Crow runs into the falling debris to try and save her. Afterwards, Sherry, Crow and Akiza find they are miraculously okay as  Black Rose Dragon  has saved them. As Sherry weeps over what she has done, Crow talks her into coming with them to try and change the future.
 The streets in  New Domino  are deserted as the  Ark Cradle  descends closer.
 Up above,  Vizor  and  Yusei  have been traveling along their route for so long, they consider that they may be lost.
 In another route,  Jack ,  Leo  and  Luna  have also been traveling for quite a while. Leo asks if they should turn back, but having come this far, Jack thinks they should continue. Leo agrees and assumes that they'll reach the core soon and see Yusei again. Luna then wonders if Yusei is really going to die, but Jack reminds them that they're here to stop that future. Jack then thinks to himself that if Yusei really does die, Jack won't be able to settle the scores and prays for Yusei not to die.
 
       The devices and cuffs Aporia attaches to his opponents.     
 Jack and the twins come to the end of their route and dismount from  Phoenix Whirlwind . Seeing the  Ener-D  light, they suspect that they have reached their Planetary Gear.  Aporia  then appears before them, affirms that they are correct and vows to stop them reaching the gear. A hole is opened in the wall and three devices are ejected. They clamp onto Jack, Leo and Luna's chests and cuffs come out of the floor and wrap around their left feet. They struggle to pull off the devices but they're stuck. Needles begins to come out of the devices and pierce into their bodies in the direction of their hearts. Jack curses Aporia and demands to know what these are. Aporia explains that these are to stop them running away, but he says that he shall crush them before they can even think of running away. He repeats that he shall not let them get to Planetary Gear, not unless they can defeat him in a Duel. The twins are worried, but Jack says to bring it on, as he shall defeat Aporia.
 To their surprise, Leo and Luna find that their  Duel Disks  can activate, meaning that the Ener-D is working again. Leo is excited as this means he can help too. Jack reminds him to be careful and this is a fight for  Team 5D's . Leo gets even more excited and turns to Luna, telling her to do her best. Luna nods, but gets a bit worried. However Leo vows to protect her.
 Aporia explains that this Duel shall follow  Tag Duel  rules. He will start with 4000  Life Points  and go first. After his turn, his opponent's get a turn each and they will continue to rotate that way. The ring comes off Aporia's back and forms into his Duel Disk. 
 
       Aporia connects to Fortissimo.     
 Aporia begins by activating the  Field Spell  " Fortissimo the Mobile Fortress ". The arena to a blue tube-like enclosure. The walls are lined with hexagons connected by pipes, all connected to a giant fortress that Aporia stands in. The floor Jack and the twins are standing on is left floating mid-air inside the tube. Aporia's legs join and his lower body open to reveal a number of connection ports. An array of wires come out of the fortress and connect to him. With this, Aporia says that the Duel is now setup; His opponent's life is connected to this Duel. If their  Life Points  reach 0, so do their lives. Leo realizes that this means they could die. Jack refuses to let Aporia treat their lives like that, but Aporia points out that he doesn't have a choice. He explains that thing attached to Jack, Leo and Luna's chests cause the Planetary Gear to spin, meaning that their "wasteful hearts will be fighting against machines".
 
 
 Flashback 
       Z-one and Aporia discuss the embodiments of despair.     
 Z-one  approaches Aporia and asks if he wants to stop being human. Aporia says that he does and Z-one explains that Aporia's three embodiments of despair created three humans, whom Z-one has named  Lester ,  Primo  and  Jakob  and the three of them were used for his rebirth. Aporia says that he no longer needs despair; After losing to Team 5D's in the  World Racing Grand Prix , he lost his feeling of despair and that is what saved him. When he lost and felt there would be trouble, he felt despair. That is why he has decided that he no longer needs it nor hope. He then says all he needs are machines because with them, he believes he can protect Z-one for the sake of the future. 
 
 
 Present 
 Aporia says that for the sake of the future, he shall not let his opponents past, not until their Life Points hit 0.
 The effect of "Fortissimo the Mobile Fortress" activates. Once per turn it lets Aporia  Special Summon  a  Level  4 or lower  Machine - Type   monster  from his  hand  So he Special Summons " Meklord Army of Wisel ". He then  Normal Summons  " Meklord Army of Skiel " and  Sets  three cards in his  Spell & Trap Card Zone  before ending his turn. The twins are surprised to see him using new monsters.
 
         The damage turns out to be real.     
 Leo goes next, thinking he is ready to prove his skills. He Summons " Morphtronic Staplen " in  Defense Mode , but Aporia activates one of his  face-down  cards; the  Continuous Trap Card  " Level Cannon ". When a player Summons a monster, "Level Cannon" inflicts 200 damage times the monster's  Level  to the player. Two blasts are fired at Leo, who tries running away, but falls forward, due to the cuff on his leg. His Life Points drop to 3200 and when the smoke from the blasts cleared, Luna noticed the floor had been damaged and wondered if that was a real impact. Aporia explained that like he said their lives are linked to the Duel, so as their Life Points decrease, they will receive real pain. If they don't want that to happen, he advises the to come at him with full force.
 Jack curses Aporia again and insists that Aproria should be fighting him alone. He orders Aporia to release the other two, but Aporia remains silent. Leo stands up and tells Jack not to worry about it. He insists it was only a small amount of damage and he's okay. However he secretly worries about Luna taking that kind of damage. Leo Sets three cards in his Spell & Trap Card Zone and ends his turn.
 
         Luna gets hit by the rockets from "Damage Boost".     
 Luna goes next. As she  draws  her card, she worries that she will take the same impact as Leo if she Summons a monster. Leo tells her not to worry, as he will protect her. Luna looks at his three face-down cards and thinks that he might have something that can prevent the damage. Luna Sets two cards in her Spell & Trap Card Zone and Summons " Armored White Bear " in Defense Mode. The effect of "Level Cannon" activates, but Leo  chains  " Damage Eraser " to  negate  the damage and gain the same amount of Life Points. He says that he won't let Aporia  harm Luna so easily. However, Aporia chains " Damage Boost " to negate the effect of "Damage Eraser" and inflict double the damage. An array of rockets are fired at Luna, who lets out a wail as her Life Points drop to 2400. Leo asks if she's okay, but she drops to her knees and ends her turn.
 
         Luna gets struck by the laser from "Fortissimo".     
 In Luna's  End Phase , Aporia uses the effect of "Fortissimo the Mobile Fortress" to inflict another 100 damage to Luna since she doesn't control a Machine-Type monster. Leo objects, but a beam is fired out of the wall and strikes Luna. Luna's Life Points are lowered to 2300 and she lies on the floor injured. Leo starts to blame himself for Luna taking so much damage and begins to cry. However Jack tells him not to cry, as they have to fight this battle until the end.
 With their lives on the line, Jack thinks that the twins bodies won't be able to take this, so he vows to stop it. Jack begins his turn and activates " Trap Pause " to negate the effects of his opponent's Continuous Trap Cards until the End Phase. Aporia's "Level Cannon" card turns gray as its effect is negated. For each card negated, Jack draws a card. 
 Jack discards " Synchro Soldier " to Special Summon " Power Giant " from his hand. The Level of "Power Giant" is decreased by the Level of the monster discarded to Summon it, so its Level becomes 5. Next Jack Normal Summons " Dark Resonator ". He tunes the two monsters and  chants   "The ruler's heartbeats will now file through here. Take witness to its creation shaking power. Synchro Summon! My soul, Red Demon's Dragon" , as he  Synchro Summons  " Red Dragon Archfiend ".
 Leo celebrates and vows to also stay strong in order to protect Luna. Leo activates " Power-Up Adapter ", which is equipped to "Morphtronic Staplen". This prevents "Morphtronic Staplen" from  attacking , buts transfers its ATK to "Red Dragon Archfiend". He tells Jack that the rest is up to him. Although Jack doesn't seem too impressed. Aporia activates " Power Gravity " to transfer to the ATK boost to one of his monsters and drop the original target's ATK to 0. The ATK of "Meklord Army of Wisel" and "Red Dragon Archfiend" become 3200 and 0 respectively. Leo starts to blame himself again. Annoyed, Jack Sets a card in his Spell & Trap Card Zone and ends his turn.
 
         Leo blaming himself     
 In Jack's End Phase, the effect of "Fortissimo the Mobile Fortress" activates, dropping Jack's Life Points to 3900. Leo falls to his knees and apologizes to Jack. However Jack tells him not to cry again, as the Duel isn't over yet. He orders him to stand up and continue. Leo defeatedly asks what he can do, but Luna tells him that she's okay and asks him to do his best. Leo's eyes begin to water, as he thinks he's not a good brother.
 Aporia begins his turn. Since there is only one card in his hand, he is able to activate " Aurora Draw ", which lets him draw 2 cards. Aporia Normal Summons " Meklord Army of Granel ". The effect of "Level Cannon" then activates and drops his own Life Points to 3200. However he appears unharmed, when the smoke clears. Jack curses Aporia and asks him if he feels the pain, but Aporia ignores him.
 Aporia activates the effect of "Meklord Army of Granel", "Gravity Prester". This halves the  DEF  of "Armored White Bear". With "Meklord Army of Wisel", Aporia attacks "Red Dragon Archfiend". "Meklord Army of Wisel" uses its " Ghoul Kick-Up " attack to slice "Red Dragon Archfiend" in two and drop Jack's Life Points to 700. The device on Jack's chest starts flashing red and Jack falls to the ground in pain. The effect of "Meklord Army of Wisel" allows "Meklord Army of Skiel" to inflict  Piercing  damage. "Meklord Army of Skiel" attacks "Armored White Bear" with its "Twin Pulse" attack, destroying it and dropping Luna's Life Points to 1800. Lastly "Meklord Army of Granel" attacks Luna with its "Gravity Prester" attack, dropping her Life Points to 200. She falls to the floor and Leo tries going over to her, but is held back by the cuff on his foot. He realizes that Luna and Jack are both lying unconscious and asks why this happened.
 
         Leo faces Aporia alone as Luna and Jack are knocked unconscious.     
 Aporia activates " Lock-On Laser ". When an opponent  Sets  a card in the  Spell and Trap Card Zone , it will inflict 200 damage to them. He comments that his opponents act on their feelings alone and shall pay for such actions with their Life Points, as their real lives trickle away in the process. He suggests that Luna and Jack may even  already be gone, as they lie motionless. Leo drops to his knees. Aporia says that by having hearts humans are so easily robbed of hope and by spending their time searching for such desires they subject themselves to suffering. He calls this ridiculous and blames their hearts on the destruction of the future. He address Leo and informs him that this is despair. A tear drops from Leo's eye as Aporia announces the end of his turn.
