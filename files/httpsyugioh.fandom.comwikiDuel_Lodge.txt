For the Duel Sanctuary in the  Yu-Gi-Oh! ARC-V  anime, see  Duel Sanctuary (ARC-V) .      
       Duel Sanctuary     
 The  Duel Sanctuary , known as the  Duel Lodge  (決闘庵  Kettō an ) in the Japanese version, is a dojo owned by  Roku . It is located in the mountains around  Heartland City . Roku carved many statues that honor famous  Duel Monsters  cards from previous eras. With the holographic technology of  Augmented Reality , he can make the statues come to life for  Statue Duels . [1] 
 An alternate version of  Duel Sanctuary  appears in  Yu-Gi-Oh! ARC-V . [2] 
 The statues include:
 
 Blade Armor Ninja 
 Blue-Eyes Ultimate Dragon 
 Blue-Eyes White Dragon 
 Cyber Dragon 
 Dark Magician 
 Dark Magician Girl 
 Elemental Hero Flame Wingman 
 Elemental Hero Neos 
 Flame Swordsman 
 Jinzo 
 Rainbow Dragon 
 Red-Eyes Black Dragon 
 Super Vehicroid - Stealth Union 
 Roku trains students to better themselves at  Duel Monsters  and other tasks. His former disciples include  Kaze . [1]  Hidden within the Lodge is a powerful Deck of cards, which Roku gives to  Yuma Tsukumo  after the boy defeats Kaze. [3]  Although he wasn't trained there,  Astral  also considers himself a disciple. [1] 
 
 Trivia 
 Each of the monster statues found in the Duel Sanctuary, with the exception of "Blade Armor Ninja" represent a different duelist from the  second series anime  and  GX  series, including  Seto Kaiba ,  Zane Truesdale ,  Yugi Moto / Yami Yugi ,  Jaden Yuki ,  Joey Wheeler ,  Jesse Anderson  and  Syrus Truesdale . 
 While many monsters used by powerful duelists from the  second series anime  and  GX  are present in statue form, no cards used by powerful duelists from  Yu-Gi-Oh! 5D's  can be found here. This may suggest that ZEXAL is meant to take place in a timeline alternative to the one seen in 5D's.
