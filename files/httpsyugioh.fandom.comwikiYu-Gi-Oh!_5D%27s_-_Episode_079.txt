 "Putting It All Together" , known as  "Toward an Unseen World"  in the Japanese version, is the seventy-ninth episode of the  Yu-Gi-Oh! 5D's  anime. It first aired in Japan on October 7, 2009 and in the United States on November 6, 2010. This episode is a clip show.
 Having come to a deep understanding that they can't do anything without  Yusei ,  Jack  and  Crow  began to rethink whether he really needs them.
 In the English dubbed version,  Rex Goodwin  had a different voice actor in this episode's flashback than he did in the previous season, despite the dialogue being the same. At the same time, however,  Luna  has her dub voice actress from the previous season in this episode's flashbacks, despite the fact that the dub voice actresses for Luna and  Leo  were changed between seasons.
 
 Summary 
 While  Yusei  is out testing their new engine,  Jack  and  Crow  discuss the changes that have recently taken place in their lives. The two grow concerned for Yusei, as Crow points out that he does tend to keep some of his feelings to himself rather than share them with his friends. The two decide to go find him and figure out what's troubling him once and for all.
 When they meet up with Yusei, he reveals his unease around  Ghost  and tells them that he suspects that  Iliaster  is behind everything, as  Roman  had told him that it was a man from Iliaster who set him down the path of becoming a  Dark Signer .
 Furthermore, they are using the  WRGP  for some mysterious plan, if  Sherry  was to be believed. The three decide to work towards mastering  Vizor 's  Accel Synchro  as a means to effectively combat Iliaster's plot and to protect the city.
 Meanwhile, an unconscious young man named  Bruno  washes up on the shore of a beach.
