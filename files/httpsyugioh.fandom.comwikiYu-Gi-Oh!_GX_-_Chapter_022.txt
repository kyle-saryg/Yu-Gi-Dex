 Conclusion!!... But Then What?! 
 
 "Shadow Game...!!" , known  "A Game of Darkness...!!"  in the Japanese version, is the twenty-second chapter of the  Yu-Gi-Oh! GX  manga . It was first printed in Japanese in  V Jump  magazine and in English in  Shonen Jump  magazine. Both of which were printed in  volume 3  of the  Yu-Gi-Oh! GX  graphic novels afterwards.
 
 Summary 
 The shadow that was responsible for putting  Koyo Hibiki  into a coma reveals that it had been sealed into a stone three thousand years ago, but had abandoned its body and since taken on a new vessel. He describes himself as a  Ka . With  the priests  that sealed him long dead, and even  the Pharaoh  himself and the  Millennium Items  gone, there will be no one to stop him. He's found that final piece needed to restore himself -  the spirit  of  Jaden Yuki 's " Winged Kuriboh " card.
 David Rabb  and  Reggie MacKenzie  confront Jaden in the hallway. Rabb is shocked that not only does a  Slifer Red  student have one of the spirits, but he's aware that it exists. Furthermore, Jaden possesses " Elemental Hero Terra Firma ", a one-of-a-kind  Legendary Planet . He reveals that they came to island specifically for the purpose of obtaining the card, and Jaden responds that he'll never give up his partner. David's earring glows, and the shadow speaks through him as his body is shrouded in darkness, saying he could always take by force, through a  Shadow Game . Jaden believes the shadow could be a hallucination, and it states that it will sacrifice Jaden as a congratulation to itself on its resurrection. An announcement for the next round comes over the school's intercom, and the shadow concludes its plans will have to go on hold for now. Assuming that Reggie wins her next match, she'd be pitted against Jaden in the semifinals, where the shadow could take "Winged Kuriboh". Rabb is surprised the shadow intends to use Reggie instead of him. As Reggie departs for her match against  Bastion Misawa , he walks by Jaden and tells him that "it was such a shame about  Koyo Hibiki ", which greatly disturbs him as even more questions rise up in his mind.
 Reggie is concerned about the dragon spirit that David saw, thinking that it could interfere with their plans. Regardless, she heads to the duel field and her duel with Bastion begins. He goes first,  Summoning  " Onmoraki " in  Attack Position  and  Setting  a card. Bastion vows to advance on so he can face Jaden in the next round. Reggie  activates  the " Angel's Ring "  Field Spell Card , which will increase the attack points of all  Fairy - Type  monsters by 200 points. She Summons " Hecatrice " in Attack Position, who attacks and  destroys  "Onmoraki". Bastion begins his turn, and activates " Mystical Space Typhoon " to destroy "Angel's Ring". This activates the effect of "Hecatrice", letting Reggie add " Divine Sanctuary " from her  Deck  to her  hand . Bastion Summons " Crow Tengu ", who attacks and destroys "Hecatrice".  Syrus Truesdale  seems confident that Bastion will make it to the next round, while  Alexis Rhodes  isn't so sure, having already dueled against and lost to Reggie in the preliminaries. Reggie activates "Divine Sanctuary", which decreases the attack points of all non-Fairy types by 500, while letting her Summon  Level  5 and 6 Fairies without  Tribute , and Level 7 and 8 Fairies with only one.
 She Summons the " Tethys, Goddess of Light ", who attacks and destroys "Crow Tengu", reducing Bastion to 2200  Life Points . She Sets a card, and Bastion activates his  face-down  " Night of One Hundred Horrors ", which lets him  Special Summon  as many  Yokai  monsters from his  Graveyard  as possible, but they will be destroyed during the  End Phase . He Special Summons "Onmoraki" and "Crow Tengu". The effect of the former lets him  draw a card , while the effect of the latter lets him destroy "Tethys". He then Summons " Mezuki ". Reggie is impressed, but still appears confident in her victory.
