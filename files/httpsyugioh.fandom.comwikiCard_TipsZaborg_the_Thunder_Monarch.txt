 This card can be searched by " Dogu ", " Single Purchase ", " Temple of the Kings ", " Transmodify ", " Witch of the Black Forest ", " Rescue Ferret ", " Chaos Zone ", " Return of the Monarchs " and " Ehther the Heavenly Monarch ". 
 Make sure your opponent has at least 1 monster on the field to destroy, so you don't have to destroy any of your monsters. However, you can prevent this if you control " By Order of the Emperor ", which would allow you to draw a card instead.
