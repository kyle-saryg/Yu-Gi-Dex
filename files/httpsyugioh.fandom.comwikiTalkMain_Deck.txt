 In terms of the sixty card limit, do the cards in the Fusion/Extra deck count also to contribute to that, or no?
 
 No. The Extra Deck does not count towards the 60-card limit, and has a separate 15-card limit.-- TwoTailedFox  ( My Talk Page ) 22:27, 8 October 2008 (UTC)

 How do you make your deck?

 Are small decks relly better? 
 In my opinion a large but balanced deck is just as good, if not better, than a 40 card deck. What dose everyone else think?  Demaster45 
 Well with a small deck you have better chances of drawing your best cards, however with a large deck you won't run out of cards so easily, so I'd say they're about the same.  SpaceGhidorah  14:21, February 12, 2010 (UTC)
 Realistically speaking, it all depends on what cards you have. If you don't have the most powerful cards and need to make several combos (equip cards, traps, etc.) or if the goal of your strategy is to deck out your opponent (I personally find this to be a rather dull strategy) then a large deck can play to your advantage. If you have 1 or 2 strong cards that can win the duel alone or a possible OTK in your deck then 40 cards is by far the best option. The only time I've ever decked out is when my own strategy backfired, and I had over 40 cards.

Making a deck as small as possible is key to increasing consistency and drawing the right cards at the right time.
 The only 2 reasons to ever add more than the minimum is to increase the variety of cards in your deck and give yourself more options, and also to avoid losing to mill decks.
 
Neither reason is very convincing to me.
 If you want to increase variety in your deck you can replace cards already in your deck which you have multiples of instead of adding more.
 Sometimes maintaining precise ratios between cards would require adding cards, but replacing cards is usually preferable, and the deck should still be kept as small as possible while maintaining those ratios.
 If milling is a problem you'd be better off using cards in your side deck whose effects counter milling strategies than adding sub-optimal cards to your maindeck and weakening other match-up.
 
Note: No matter how good each of the cards in your deck is, there is ALWAYS a "worst card". experienced players spend a lot of time identifying the worst card(s) in their deck and removing/replacing them to make their deck a little bit better.
 
 If your deck is currently larger than 40 cards play some games and take note of which cards you tend to draw when you win and which cards you draw more often when you lose. You'd probably win more often if you removed some of the second category of cards.
 
 Of course that's only important if your main goal is winning or getting to play your favorite cards a lot.
 If your goal is for each game to be as different as possible from the last than a 60 card deck with 60 different cards would be ideal. Also you should avoid using xyz, sychros, or any cards which search your deck.

 60-card limit? 
 Since when is there a MAXIMUM to your Main Deck? --Guest
 When Synchros came out (August 2008 in the US), two new max limits were made, 15 for the Extra Deck (the former Fusion Deck) and 60 for the Main Deck.
 Q: y was it changed to 60 cards in the decks how can that be helpful(can understand the the 15 extra deck limit)
 
The main use of setting an upper limit to deck size as far as I can tell is to make sure decks are small enough to shuffle easily.
 The fringe benefit is to make milling/deckout feasible as a strategy.

 Need Help 
 What do you do if you run out of cards in your main and extra deck thus having no cards to draw and no cards to play? other than attacking and playing a few magic/trap cards is there some way of getting more drawable cards?
 If you are unable to draw when you are required to do so you lose but cards like  Pot of Avarice  adds cards to your deck preventing you from  Decking Out

 Maybe something about  Convulsion of Nature  should be added? Just a suggestion.

 sorry to sound like the noob asking this, but, are the two last thing anywhere in the rule book? cause, 5 years now putting the deck sideways, and close to 3 putting the RFP monsters close to my chest.
 
 can you be more specific cause i cant understand "the two last thing" you say and the rest of your text, and you should sign your post  91.140.52.162  ( talk ) 14:09, March 14, 2012 (UTC) 
 
Unless you're playing in a tournament the relative positions of your main deck and extra deck and removed from play zone shouldn't matter. Just make sure your opponent is clear as to which cards are in which zone, and allow your opponent to see the cards in your removed from play zone when asked or if cards are moved to/from the remove from play zone
