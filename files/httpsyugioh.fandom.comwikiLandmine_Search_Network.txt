 Prior events 
 Hirutani  forced  Katsuya Jonouchi  to rejoin  his gang  by threatening to beat-up the other kids in Jonouchi's class should he refuse. However after one of the other members punched  Yugi Mutou , Jonouchi decided he had enough and started a fight with the rest of the gang later at  J'z . The gang overwhelmed Jonouchi and took him to their " torture chamber ". Here Jonouchi was tied to a hook hanging from the ceiling, while the other gangsters beat him and shocked him with their stun guns. Jonouchi still managed to knock one of them unconscious by kicking him in the face.
 While Yugi,  Hiroto Honda  and  Anzu Mazaki  were looking for Jonouchi, Yugi turned to his  Millennium Puzzle  and asked it to help him find Jonouchi. He then switched to  Dark Yugi , who located the gang at the torture chamber.
 
 The game 
       The switch     
 Dark Yugi allowed one of the gangsters to punch him back so he could secretly set up a trap while he stood up: he placed a metal bar under the arm of the gangster Jonouchi had knocked out, causing him to hold his stun gun over a puddle of water, created from rain through a hole in the ceiling. He then tied the Millennium Puzzle to a chain over the gangster's head and stood up on a tire over the puddle.
 Yugi challenged the gang to a game and warned them that there was a time bomb hidden at their feet with a switch attached. If they could find the switch, he offered them his life. However if they couldn't, he warned them that there would be a  Penalty Game ; the bomb would explode taking them with it.
 
       The gang get electrocuted.     
 The gangsters thought Dark Yugi was bluffing and prepared to shock them. However Hirutani realized that that they were wet from the rain and after being lured into a puddle. He warned the others not to use their stun guns, since the electricity would otherwise flow into the puddle and shock all of them.
 Thinking that their stun guns were the switch Dark Yugi warned them about, the gang proceeded to attack him without using them. However Dark Yugi laughed that they didn't find the switch and it was about to activate. The gangsters then noticed the unconscious member's arm over the puddle. Water then dripped from the Millennium Puzzle onto his forehead, waking him up and causing him to move his arm, which fell into the puddle with his stun gun switched on. The gangsters got shocked, while Dark Yugi was protected by the tire.
 
 
 Aftermath 
 Jonouchi had been beaten too badly to see what happened between Dark Yugi and the gang. By the time he regained consciousness, he was untied. Dark Yugi had switched back to Yugi, and Anzu and Honda had arrived.
