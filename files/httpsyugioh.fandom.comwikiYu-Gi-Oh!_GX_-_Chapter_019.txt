 Let the Tournament Begin!! 
 
 "The First Round Ends!!" , known as  "End of the Preliminary Rounds!!"  in the Japanese version, is the nineteenth chapter of the  Yu-Gi-Oh! GX  manga . It was first printed in Japanese in  V Jump  magazine and in English in  Shonen Jump  magazine. Both of which were printed in  volume 2  of the  Yu-Gi-Oh! GX  graphic novels afterwards.
 
 Summary 
 Reggie MacKenzie  Summons " The Splendid Venus " in her  Duel  with  Alexis Rhodes , and explains that it is one of  monsters  known as the " Legendary Planets ". She explains that its  effect  will cause all monsters on the  field  that are not of the  Fairy - Type  to lose 500 attack and defense points. Alexis' " Frost Tiger " has its attack decreased to 1400, and Reggie attacks with "Venus". Alexis  activates  her  face-down  " Twin Pillars of Ice ", which produces two ice pillars. She removes a pillar, which reduces the  Battle Damage  to zero and prevents "Frost Tiger's" destruction. Reggie compliments Alexis' move and Sets a card to end her turn.
 Alexis activates " Soul Infusing Sculptor ", which removes the second ice pillar and  Special Summons  a " Pillar Token " in Attack Position. Alexis Tributes "Frost Tiger" and the "Pillar Token" to Summon " Ice Queen ". Reggie states that Alexis' dueling skills are as impressive as her  brother's , but it doesn't matter - "Ice Queen" will still grovel before "The Splendid Venus". Alexis claims it will be the reverse, and activates " Crown of Command ",  equipping  it to "Ice Queen". Any monster that battles her will lose 500 attack and defense points, which would make up the attack power lost from "Ice Queen" via "Venus'" effect. Alexis attacks, and Reggie moves to activate her face-down card. Before she can, Alexis plays " Instant Freeze " from her hand, which would return Reggie's Set card to its face-down position and prevent its activation for three turns. However, "The Splendid Venus'" other effect prevents the  negation  of her  Spell  and  Trap Cards . Thus, she is able to activate " Light of the Master ", which increases the attack and defense points of one Fairy-type monster by 300. "Ice Queen" is destroyed. Reggie has won, as Alexis as no monsters to defend her, and "Venus" would attack her  directly  next turn.
 Reggie thanks her for the Duel, stating she was glad to experience the strength that  Duel Academy  holds, and they both vow to Duel again in the tournament finals. Reggie asks Alexis if she knows anything about cards with spirits in them. Alexis responds that she doesn't, but that he heard  Jaden Yuki  talk of that once. Jaden himself has just met  David Rabb  in the forest, and is speaking to him in the best English he can muster, very slowly, not realizing that David is fluent in Japanese. David explains this, and Jaden challenges him to a Duel, which David declines, as dueling a  Slifer Red  student would garner as many tournament points as a  Ra Yellow  or  Obelisk Blue  student, and David aims to enter the finals. He states that Yellow would be worth five Reds, while a Blue would be worth ten Reds. In addition, he's already dueled  one  red student, and states he was no match for him. David departs, and Jaden is infuriated by his disrespect for the color red. He vows to make it the finals so he can Duel David. He encounters and Oblisk Blue student, who does agree to Duel him.  Chancellor Sheppard ,  Dr. Crowler ,  Professor Hibiki  and  Zane Truesdale  watch the Duels taking place around the island from various points, and are impressed at the results. Soon after, the preliminary rounds come to a close.

 Alexis' turn 
Alexis activates " Soul Infusing Sculptor ", removing the second ice pillar from and  Special Summoning  a " Pillar Token " (0/0) in Attack Position, whose name is treated as "Frost Tiger". Alexis  Tributes  her two  monsters  to  Tribute Summon  " Ice Queen " (2900/2100) in Attack Position, whose ATK/ DEF  are decreased by 500 via the effect of "Venus", to 2400 and 1600, respectively. Alexis activates " Crown of Command ",  equipping  it to "Ice Queen". If "Ice Queen" battles, "Crown of Command" reduces the ATK and DEF of the monster it is battling by 500. Alexis attacks, and Reggie activates her face-down " Light of the Master ".
