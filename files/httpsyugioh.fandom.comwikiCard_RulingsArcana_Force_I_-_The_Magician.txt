 Previously Official Rulings 
   These TCG rulings were issued by  Upper Deck Entertainment  and have since been deemed unofficial by Konami. [1]  They were previously considered official and can still be correct, as long as they follow the official gameplay rules, or unless Konami has issued a ruling that says otherwise.

 The heads/tails effects of " Arcana Force I - The Magician " are Continuous Effects and are applied immediately after the Spell Card resolves. 
 The heads effect of " Arcana Force I - The Magician " does not change its original ATK. It creates a new current ATK equal to twice its original ATK. Any other increases or decreases of ATK are reapplied to this new ATK value. 
 If " Arcana Force I - The Magician " is affected by a Spell Card that changes its ATK, like “ Shrink ” or “ Rush Recklessly ,” first the Spell Card’s effect is applied, then “ Arcana Force I – The Magician ’s” effect is applied, changing its current ATK to twice its original ATK, or 2200.
