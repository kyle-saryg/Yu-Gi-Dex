 Yami Yugi ,  Seto Kaiba ,  Lumis  and  Umbra  faced each other in a game of  Duel Monsters , during the  Battle City  arc, in the  Yu-Gi-Oh!  anime . It is based on the  Explosive Tag Team Match of Death  from the  manga .
 
 Prior Events 
 After  Joey Wheeler 's duel with  Mako Tsunami ,  Tristan Taylor  parts from the group to pick up  Serenity Wheeler . Suddenly, Joey,  Téa Gardner  and  Solomon Muto  find  a young man calling himself Namu  carrying an injured  Bakura Ryou . Mr. Muto offers to take Bakura to the hospital. A short while later, Joey and Tea are surrounded by Rare Hunters and are captured.
 Suddenly, outside an office building, two cloaked duelists arrive and they inform  Yugi Muto  and  Seto Kaiba  that their friends are now in their possession and if they want to find them, they will have to duel them for that information. The two lead Yugi, now in his alter-ego, and Kaiba to the top of a building and introduce themselves as  Lumis and Umbra , the  two   duelists  they met before, but now they are taking part in another duel. In this duel there are devices placed under the glass of each duelists feet. The moment the display on the devices, which are life points, reach zero, they'll cause the glass to shatter and the duelist to fall into a vortex leading to the Shadow Realm. To save their friends, the duel commences.

During each of Lumis' Standby Phases, he must pay 1000 Life Points or else "Mask of Brutality" will be destroyed.  Umbra  then  activates  " Masked Doll " to  negate  the cost of "Mask of Brutality".
 Turn 4: Kaiba 
 Kaiba  draws. He then  Sets  two cards. Kaiba's hand contains " Saggi the Dark Clown ", " Monster Reborn ", "Vorse Raider", and " Battle Ox ". Kaiba then  Normal Summons  " Vorse Raider " (1900/1200) in  Attack Position .

Now the equipped monster can't attack and if it's the only monster Yugi controls, Lumis or Umbra can attack Yami Yugi directly. During each of Yami Yugi's Standby Phases, "Mask of the Accursed" will inflict 500 damage to him.  Lumis   Sets  a card.
 Turn 6: Yami Yugi 
Yami Yugi draws "Beast of Gilfer". The effect of "Mask of the Accursed"  activates  (Yami Yugi 4000 → 3500).  Yami Yugi  attempts to  Tribute  "Beta The Magnet Warrior" in order to  Tribute Summon  " Beast of Gilfer ", but  Lumis   activates  his face-down " Mask of Restrict ". Now  Yami Yugi  and  Kaiba  are forbidden from  tributing  any of their monsters for a Tribute Summon.  Yami Yugi  then  Sets  a card and  Normal Summons  " Kuriboh " (300/200) in  Defense Position .

Kaiba  then  activates  his face-down " Ring of Defense " to protect his  Life Points  from the effect of "Ring of Destruction", but  Umbra   activates  his face-down " Spell Transfer " to negate the effect of "Ring of Defense" and activate the effect of "Spell Transfer" as the effect of "Ring of Defense", allowing Umbra to protect himself from the effect of "Ring of Destruction" (Seto Kaiba 4000 → 2100). 
 A replay then occurs and Umbra uses "Shining Abyss" to  attack   Kaiba  directly, but  Yami Yugi   activates  his face-down " Multiply " to create a large wall made up of "Kuribohs". The attack destroys part of the wall, but the wall quickly regenerates shortly after the attack is through.

 "The Masked Beast"  attacks   Yami Yugi  directly, but  Kaiba  blocks the  attack  with "Battle Ox". "The Masked Beast"  destroys  "Battle Ox".  Yami Yugi  then  activates  his face-down "Card Destruction" to make every duelist  discard  their  hand  and  draw  the same numbers of cards they  discarded . Since "Beast of Gilfer" was  sent  to the  Graveyard , its  effect  activates, allowing  Yami Yugi  to  equip  it to "The Masked Beast" and decrease its  ATK  by 500 ("The Masked Beast": 3200 → 2700/1800), but this isn't known to the other players yet.

 Aftermath 
 The platform Umbra is standing on shatters and Umbra himself falls into the vortex. He tries to pull a parachute but even though the chute opens, it's too late, as Umbra's mind is sent to the Shadow Realm. Yami and Kaiba get into an argument when suddenly, Marik, who is controlling Lumis, informs Yugi that Joey and Tea are now his mind slaves. Furious, Kaiba asks him where Mokuba but Lumis falls unconscious. Suddenly, a helicopter appears with Mokuba inside it. Kaiba reluctantly agrees to help Yami save his friends since Tea saved Mokuba.
