 Personality 
 Hans is quite a psychotic man in nature as when he went to speak to  Nicolas  and  Hermann  after their victory over  Team Unicorn , he kept hitting things with an iron rod even though there was no purpose. He also takes enjoyment in others pain such as laughing hysterically when people are hurt by his plans.
 
 Biography 
 Pre-World Racking Grand Prix 
 Before the WRGP, Hans lives in the slums with  Nicolas  and  Hermann  claiming that the unity of  Satellite  and  New Domino City  didn't affect their lives at all. One day, Hermann was riding his  Duel Runner  when  Primo  stood in his way causing him to dodge and crash which in turn caused Hans and Nicolas to question Primo's intentions. Primo then awarded them with a couple of  Dark   cards  which would help them cause other Duel teams to crash which would win them the WRGP by default earning them titles of Duel kings which would lead them to a life of glory and fame. Agreeing to this, Hans along with his team mates agreed and formed Team Catastrophe to enter the  World Racing Grand Prix .
 
 World Racing Grand Prix 
 Hans was first seen when  Andre  was Dueling  Yusei Fudo  along with his team mates which were all smiling at the Duel calling them weak due to them not understanding true power. He was then later seen when they beat  Team Unicorn  and was smiling smugly about the incident which surprised  Team 5D's  as both Andre and  Jean  were badly hurt and needed instant medical attention. After this, he along with his team mates wanted to destroy Team 5D's so that they only had 2 members to enter with. Since Hermann had already broken Crow's arm, they decided to go after  Akiza Izinski  whilst she was practicing for their upcoming match. They used the effect of " Hook the Hidden Knight " to lock  Akiza's Duel Runner  which caused her to crash and go into a small coma. They then cheered and drove off thinking that taking  Jack Atlas  and Yusei Fudo out with their cards of darkness would be easily done.
 On the day of their match, to their surprise  Crow Hogan  attended and took part in the Duel, dodging the damage from the card of darkness which caused Hans and Nicolas to get angry.
