 Previously Official Rulings 
   These TCG rulings were issued by  Upper Deck Entertainment  and have since been deemed unofficial by Konami. [1]  They were previously considered official and can still be correct, as long as they follow the official gameplay rules, or unless Konami has issued a ruling that says otherwise. References:  [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] 
 
 When a monster selected for " Amazoness Blowpiper "'s effect is  flipped  face-down, the effect is reset. 
 After selecting a monster with " Amazoness Blowpiper "'s effect, if " Amazoness Blowpiper " is  flipped  face-down or removed from the field, its effect still applies until the end of the turn.
