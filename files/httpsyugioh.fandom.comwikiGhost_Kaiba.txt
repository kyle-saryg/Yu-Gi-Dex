 Ghost Kaiba , known in the Japanese version as the  Imitator of Death  and in the English video games as the  Mimic of Doom , was one of  Pegasus ' hired  Eliminators . He replaces the  Ventriloquist of the Dead , from the manga.
 He claimed that Kaiba was dead and that he was Kaiba's ghost back for revenge. He took on the form of  Seto Kaiba  to Duel  Yugi Muto , and also used Kaiba's Deck in the Duel. However, once the real Kaiba is revealed to be alive, the Mimic was forced to reveal his true form, which was an ugly, obese clown. 
 In the Japanese version, the Mimic was either an extremely talented master of disguise or more likely a shapeshifter, taking into account that he even seemed capable of altering his own body weight. In the English dub, the Mimic claimed to be Kaiba's evil side which  Yami Yugi  had separated from him and banished to the  Shadow Realm , and that he was brought back as a separate being by  Pegasus  with the power of his  Millennium Eye .

 Biography 
 Ghost Kaiba faced  Yami Yugi  in a Duel over  Mokuba 's release, and he "proved" that he was Seto Kaiba by playing the " Blue-Eyes White Dragon ".
 In the meantime, the real Kaiba, having survived his encounter with Pegasus's goons, began to hack and find out about the Duel. Yugi defeated the first "Blue-Eyes White Dragon" using a combination of " Dark Magician ", " Magical Hats " and " Spellbinding Circle ", but the second Blue-Eyes White Dragon destroyed "Dark Magician". Kaiba hacked into the Duel arena to weaken this dragon, and the third "Blue-Eyes White Dragon" still in the Deck. After seeing this, and then the dragon suddenly being destroyed, Yugi realized that Kaiba was still alive and demanded to know the impostor's true identity.
 
       Ghost Kaiba being inflicted with a mind crush.     
 He began playing monsters in defense mode until he found the final "Blue-Eyes", but Yugi revived one of the other "Blue-Eyes White Dragons" and raised its power with " Mystical Elf " and " Book of Secret Arts ", using it to destroy Ghost Kaiba's final dragon and wipe out his remaining Life Points. Yugi defeated him and banished him back to the Shadow Realm for good. In the Japanese version, he used the  Millennium Puzzle 's power to make him disappear off the face of the earth. Despite Yugi's victory,  Kemo  took Mokuba back to Pegasus.
