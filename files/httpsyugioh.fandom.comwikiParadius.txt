           The Paradus insignia.     
 Paradius  is an organization lead by  Dartz  during the " Waking the Dragons " arc of  Yu-Gi-Oh! . It hid the secret activities of  Doma . Its insignia is similar to " The Seal of Orichalcos ".
 It is said that Paradius owns a small piece of every company in the world. This company briefly took control of both  KaibaCorp  and  Industrial Illusions . The organization's headquarters itself appears to be a type of castle. In Dartz's conference room, he has a mirror which transports him from his sea lair to Paradius headquarters.
 The Paradius building hosted the  Duels  of  Mai Valentine  against  Rafael  and the rematch between  Yami Yugi  and Rafael.
