 Description 
 A complete set of  Heart Pieces  is the starting key for each  Duelist 's coaster. When a Duelist's  Life Points  hit zero, they are ejected from their car and parachuted down. The empty car is switched to a different track and the winner continues on. [1] 
 There are special spots on the track, with  Spell  and  Trap Card  markings. If a Duelist goes over one of these spots, they will  activate  the card's  effect . 
 
         A Magic Point readout with card list.     
 Trap Points have effects that inflict  Effect Damage  (" Secret Barrel ", " The Paths of Destiny ", " Cemetary Bonb ", and an  unnamed trap  that dealt 200 points of damage) while Spell Points have effects that let you gain Life Points (" Mooyan Curry ", " Dian Keto the Cure Master " and " Rain of Mercy ").
 This incorporates a new element of luck and strategy, as one could be on the verge of defeat but can also find themselves revived or unexpectedly defeated. Life Points don't reset every time there's a new Duel. [1]  As such, skills such as handling speed, keeping track of which lanes your opponents are in, and keeping in mind the amount of Life and the type of cards set along the track add for a much more unpredictable Duel style. [1] 
 
 Rules 
 The following are known rules of this system. [2] 
 
 There are no  turns . Duelists may  Normal Summon   monsters  and activate  Spell  and  Trap Cards  whenever they wish. 
 Draw Phases  are conducted only when a Duelist hits a Draw Point. 
 Monsters cannot be  Set , they must be Normal Summoned in  Defense Position . 
 You may only  attack  another Duelist if they are on the same lane as you and in front of you. Also, you can switch lanes in order to avoid attacks. 
 You begin with 4000  Life Points , which are not restored after each Duel. 
 Ramming your opponents is legal. 
 A player may use their allies' monsters for a  Fusion  or  Xyz Summon . 
 Players may Set Spell and Trap Cards on the coaster in order to damage other players with their effects.
