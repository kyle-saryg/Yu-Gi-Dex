 Etymology 
 "Sun Shadow" is a direct translation of his Japanese name Hikage. This is in contrast to his brother  Moon Shadow 's name (Tsukikage), as evidenced further by the sun insignia on his forehead.
 
 Biography 
 Arc League Championship 
       Sun Shadow saves Celina     
 During the  Battle Royal , he and his brother,  Moon Shadow , initially stayed in the Jungle Area.  Declan Akaba  hired him and Moon Shadow to keep  Celina  safe from the  Fusion Dimension  in hopes that she would join their cause.
 Sun Shadow saved Celina and  Zuzu Boyle  from the  Obelisk Force  by using a smoke bomb to stun them. [2] 
 Sun and Moon Shadow saved  Shay  from being captured by  Sora Perse . Sun Shadow stalled Sora with a Duel, while Moon Shadow took the chance to lead Shay and Celina to safety. Sun Shadow lost and was  sealed  into  a card  as a result. [3] 
 
 Friendship Cup Finals 
 Moon has been trying to free Sun ever since he was sealed away and challenged Sora after he appeared in the  Synchro Dimension . [4] 
 
 Duel Academy 
       Sun Shadow appearing behind his brother Moon Shadow.     
 After  Z-ARC 's defeat and the  Standard Dimension  being reborn into the  "Pendulum Dimension" , Sun Shadow was freed from his  card , but had lost his memories of  Zuzu  and the events involving people from  other dimensions . He appeared next to  Moon Shadow  when the latter was reminding  Yuya ,  Gong , and  Sylvio  of their past. [5]  He is later seen watching Yuya's Duel against  Jack Atlas  with Moon Shadow [6]  and applauded when Yuya won. He then watched Yuya and  Declan 's  Action Duel . [7]  He was happy when Yuya won the Duel and witnessed  Zuzu 's revival. [8]
