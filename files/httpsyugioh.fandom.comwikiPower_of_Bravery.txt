In addition, the banished monster will be Special Summoned to your side of the field at the end of your opponent's next turn. 
" Morphtronic Celfon ", Obtain  Leo's  trusty companion, "Morphtronic Celfon"! When it's in attack position, you can roll a die and excavate cards from the top of your Deck equal to the roll, and Special Summon 1 Level 4 or lower " Morphtronic " monster from among them! 
" Vylon Epsilon ", A Synchro Monster that lets you destroy 1 monster your opponent controls by sending an Equip Spell Card equipped to it to the Graveyard.
