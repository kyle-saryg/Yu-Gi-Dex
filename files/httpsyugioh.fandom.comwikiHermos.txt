 Hermos, like other legendary knights, is named after Plato's work. Hermos is named after  Hermocrates  from Plato's dialogues  Timaeus  and  Critias .
 In his human form, Hermos wears red armor. Like the other knights he bears a similar facial expression to his chosen duelist,  Joey Wheeler .
 His red color scheme follows him into his dragon form.
 Hermos has a  Duel Monsters  card form. The card, " Claw of Hermos ", along with its counterparts " The Eye of Timaeus " and " Fang of Critias " are unlike other cards. They have their own set of rules and are color coded blue. Although  Monster Cards , the Dragons are played similar to if they were  Spell Cards  and can combine with other cards. Hermos can combine with monsters to form  Equip Spell Cards . It has been shown to combine with five such cards; " Big Bang Blow ", " Queen's Knight ", " Red-Eyes Black Dragon ", " Rocket Warrior " and " Time Wizard " to form " Big Bang Dragon Blow ", " Goddess Bow ", " Red-Eyes Black Dragon Sword ", " Rocket Hermos Cannon " and " Time Magic Hammer ".
 
 Biography 
 Ancient Atlantis 
 Hermos and the other legendary knights,  Timaeus  and  Critias  resided in the Spirit's World, until  Atlantis  became corrupt by the  Orichalcos .  Ironheart  Summoned them to the human world, to help him defeat  Dartz , who was trying to wipe out the population of Atlantis and start fresh. However Dartz weakened the knights by turning them into dragons.
 The  Legendary Dragons , fought alongside rebels from Atlantis and more Duel Spirits against Dartz,  Orichalcos Soldiers  and  The Great Leviathan .
 The battle ended with neither side victorious and Atlantis sunk to the bottom of the sea. The Dragons were sealed in crystal prisons, until they would be needed again.
 
 Present time 
         Joey acquires Hermos.     
 Joey Wheeler  was chosen as a Legendary Duelist to wield Hermos. During a Duel with  Mai Valentine , he and Yugi were subconsciously taken to the Duel Monsters Spirit World, where they saw Hermos trapped in his prison. By removing a sword Joey set Hermos free and got the card " Claw of Hermos ", so that he may Summon "Hermos" while playing  Duel Monsters .
 As a card, Hermos had the ability to combine itself with monster to create  Equip Spell Cards . Joey used it to form " Time Magic Hammer " in his Duel against Mai. He also used it against Rex to create " Red-Eyes Black Dragon Sword ", against Valon to create " Rocket Hermos Cannon " and " Big Bang Dragon Blow " and in his second Duel against Mai to create "Red-Eyes Black Dragon Sword" again.
 After Joey lost to Mai, Mai had a change of heart stormed off to face Dartz taking the "Hermos" card with her. However she was confronted by  Rafael , who defeated her and took the card. When Yugi arrived, Rafael gave him the card, before they dueled. Yugi used it in the Duel to create " Goddess Bow ".
 When Yugi and Kaiba faces Dartz, Yugi used " Legend of Heart " to change the dragons back to their true forms. Together with  Timaeus  and  Critias , Yugi was able to defeat Dartz's " Divine Serpent Geh " and win the Duel.
 However The Great Leviathan, was Summoned again. Hermos took part in the battle against it, this time his side emerged victorious. He, Timaeus, Critias and  Dark Magician Girl  appeared on the beach to thank Yugi before returning to the spirit world.
