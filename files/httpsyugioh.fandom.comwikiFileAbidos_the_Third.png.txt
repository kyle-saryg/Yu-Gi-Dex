       Linework     
 Abidos the Third  (アビドス３世  Abidosu San-sei ) is an ancient boy pharaoh and the fifth of the  Shadow Riders . He never lost a single Duel. Abidos regained physical form through the powers of the  Shadow Charm  circlet he wore.
 Kagemaru  has Abidos the Third awakened to fulfil his duties to the shadows. Abidos the Third then orders for his chariot to be prepped for launch.
 With an army of mummies, Abidos gathers  Jaden Yuki  and company on his celestial golden yacht for a Duel.
 During the Duel with Jaden, Abidos displays rather mediocre skills as a Duelist, and lacks an understanding on direct attacks, believing them to be against the rules when Jaden inflicts him with one. Thinking back to his previous duels, he realized that the only reason he kept winning was because his opponents always lost on purpose, fearing retribution in the event that they defeated him. Jaden decided it was time Abidos learned how to really Duel and this Duel was a good start where he even had Abidos remove his mask. Abidos summons " Spirit of the Pharaoh " and pushes Jaden to a corner, but he makes a comeback with " Hero Flash!! ". 
 Satisfied with his defeat, Abidos departs for the afterlife, giving Jaden his Shadow Charm, the latter making a promise to meet him again in one hundred years time. 
 
 Trivia 
 His name is derived from the name of the ancient Egyptian city, Abydos. Abidos' character is based on a real world pharaoh, apparently  Tutankhamun .
