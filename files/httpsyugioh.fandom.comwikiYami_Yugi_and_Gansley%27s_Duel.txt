 Prior Events 
 After  Noah Kaiba  isolates everyone and dumps them into the virtual world, he sends  Gansley ,  KaibaCorp 's former CEO, after Yugi. Yugi finds himself at a lakeside where he soon encounters a strange creature. The creature tells him he is Gansley, but since he has no body of his own anymore, he has taken on the form of his  Deck Master , " Deepsea Warrior ". He proposes that he and Yugi will duel and if he loses, he will claim his body as his own. In order to duel, both players will create decks from the cards in the virtual card database. When Yugi is about to pick " Dark Magician " as his Deck Master, " Kuriboh " comes out of it's own card. 
 
 The Deck Masters 
 Yami Yugi : " Kuriboh "
 Gansley : " Deepsea Warrior "
 
 Featured Duel: Yami Yugi vs. Gansley 
 Yugi 's  Deck Master  is " Kuriboh ".  Gansley 's Deck Master is " Deepsea Warrior ".
 Turn 1: Gansley 
 Gansley   draws  a  monster  and subsequently  Sets  it.
 Turn 2: Yugi 
 Yugi  draws " Obnoxious Celtic Guardian " and subsequently Normal Summons it (1400/1200) in  Attack Position . He then Sets a card. "Obnoxious Celtic Guardian"  attacks  and  destroys  Gansley's Set monster, which is " Ashingray " (500/500). The  Flip Effect  of "Ashingray" then  activates , forcing Yugi to  discard  a card (" Exchange "). As "Ashingray" was  destroyed by battle  the second effect of "Ashingray" activates, letting Gansley  Special Summon  another copy of "Ashingray" from his  Deck  (500/500) in  face-down   Defense Position . Yugi's hand contains " Gazelle the King of Mythical Beasts ", " Berfomet ", and " De-Spell ".
 Turn 3: Gansley 
Gansley draws " Ipiria " and subsequently Normal Summons it (500/500) in Attack Position. The effect of "Ipiria" then activates, allowing Gansley to draw a card. Gansley then  Flip Summons  "Ashingray" (500/500). This activates the Flip Effect of "Ashingray" and Yugi discards "De-Spell".
 Turn 4: Yugi 
Yugi draws " Polymerization " and subsequently activates it to  fuse  the "Berfomet" and "Gazelle the King of Mythical Beasts" in his hand in order to  Fusion Summon  " Gazelle the King of Mythical Beasts " (2100/1800) in Attack Position. Yugi then activates his face-down " Quick Attack " to allow "Chimera" to attack this  turn  even though it's a Fusion Monster. "Chimera" attacks "Ipiria", but Gansley activates the  Deck Master ability  of "Deepsea Warrior", Reflector Hold, to  negate  the attack and inflict  damage  to Yugi equal to the attacking monster's ATK (Yugi 4000 → 1900) by  Tributing  "Ashingray" and Ipiria".
 Yami Yugi has 1900  Life Points  remaining and controls "Obnoxious Celtic Guardian (1400/1200) and "Chimera the Flying Mythical Beast" (2100/1800) in Attack Position.
 Gansley has 4000 Life Points remaining and controls no cards.
 Turn 4: Yugi 
" Obnoxious Celtic Guardian "  attacks   directly  (Gansley 4000 → 2600). Because Gansley received at least 1000 or more  Battle Damage , he  Special Summons  " Ruklamba the Spirit King " (1000/2000) from his  hand  in  Attack Position  via its own  effect .
 Turn 5: Gansley 
 Gansley   draws  " Yowie " and subsequently  Normal Summons  it (500/500) in Attack Position. Since "Yowie" was Normal Summoned, its effect activates, forcing  Yugi  to skip his next  Draw Phase . Gansley then activates " Premature Burial " to  pay  800  Life Points  (Gansley 2600 → 1800) and revive " Ipiria " (500/500) in Attack Position. The effect of "Ipiria" activates, allowing Gansley to draw one card. [Notes 1] 
 Turn 6: Yugi 
Due to the effect of "Yowie", Yugi skips his  Draw Phase . "Obnoxious Celtic Guardian" attacks "Ipiria", but Gansley activates his  Deck Master ability  to  negate  the attack and inflict  damage  to Yugi equal to the  ATK  of "Obnoxious Celtic Guardian" (Yugi 1900 → 500) by  Tributing  "Ipiria" and "Yowie". Gansley then activates the effect of "Ruklamba", Tributing it to Special Summon two monsters from his hand whose combined ATK are 2000 or less. He Special Summons " Wall of Illusion " (1000/1850) and another "Ruklamba" (1000/2000) in Attack Position. Gansley's hand contains " Ashingray ", " Melchid the Four-Face Beast ", and a third copy of "Ruklamba".
 Yami Yugi has 500  Life Points  remaining and controls "Obnoxious Celtic Guardian (1400/1200) and "Chimera the Flying Mythical Beast" (2100/1800) in Attack Position.
 Gansley has 1800 Life Points remaining and controls "Ruklamba the Spirit King" (1000/2000) and "Wall of Illusion" (1000/1850) in Attack Position.
 Turn 7: Gansley 
 Gansley   draws  "Rainbow Snake Eingana", while his hand contains " Melchid the Four-Face Beast ", " Ashingray ", and " Ruklamba the Spirit King ". Gansley  Normal Summons  "Melchid the Four-Face Beast" (1500/1200) in  Attack Position . "Melchid"  attacks  and  destroys  " Obnoxious Celtic Guardian " (Yugi 500 → 400).
 Turn 8: Yugi 
 Yugi  draws "Rainbow Blessing" and subsequently  Sets  it.
 Turn 9: Gansley 
Gansley draws " Offerings to the Doomed " and subsequently  activates  it to destroy " Chimera the Flying Mythical Beast " at the cost of skipping his next  Draw Phase . Since "Chimera" was destroyed, Yugi activates the effect of "Chimera" to revive " Berfomet " (1400/1800) in  Defense Position .
 
       " Rainbow Snake Eingana " swallows " Berfomet ", leaving Yugi with no monsters on the field.     
 Gansley  Tributes  "Melchid" and " Wall of Illusion " to  Tribute Summon  " Rainbow Snake Eingana " (2200/2400) in Attack Position. "Eingana" attacks and destroys "Berfomet". "Ruklamba the Spirit King" then attacks  directly , but Yugi activates his  Deck Master 's  ability  to  negate  the attack and move his Deck Master, " Kuriboh " (300/200), to the field in Attack Position.
 Turn 10: Yugi 
Yugi draws "Swift Gaia the Fierce Knight". He then activates his face-down " Rainbow Blessing ",  equipping  it to "Kuriboh". As he has no other cards in his hand, Yugi Normal Summons " Swift Gaia the Fierce Knight " (2300/1700) in Attack Position without Tributing. Yugi activates the effect of "Rainbow Blessing" to Tribute the equipped "Kuriboh" and allow all other monsters he  controls  to attack directly this  turn . "Swift Gaia" attacks directly (Gansley does not activate his Deck Master's ability at this point as it doesn't stop direct attacks) (Gansley 1800 → 0).
 
 Aftermath 
 Gansley's Deepsea Warrior dematerializes and Yugi begins to search for his friends.
 
 Notes 
 
 ↑   Gansley  was neither shown declaring the effect of "Ipiria", nor shown drawing a card afterwards. However, the number of cards in his hand can be seen later, which indicates that the effect was used.
