 Lyrics (TV Size) 
 Kanji Rōmaji English 
 
 天 の 川 浮 かぶ 背 の 低 い 丘 
 見 渡 す 景 色 は 想 像 と 違 う 
あの 頃 と 比 べ 前 に 進 めた？ 
 答 えはＮＯじゃない だけど 足 りない 
 意 地 悪 な 神 が 僕 等 試 すんだ 
 空 席 を 埋 めて 次 のステージ 向 かおう 
「どんな 関 係 ？」 なんて 聞 かれたら 
 友 達 以 上 かな...それも 少 し 違 うか 
 絆 と 云 う 言 葉 が 相応 しい 
 喧 嘩 し 合 いながら  分 かち 合 いながら 
「ねぇ 今 何 処 ？」 「 地 球 ん 中 」 
 宇 宙 飛 行 士 じゃないから 
オゾンより 下 なら 問 題 無 い 
「わかってる、すぐ 行 く。」 
 朝 まで 騒 ぎたいのでしょう 
 大 切 な 居 場 所 で
 
 
 Ama no gawa ukabu Se no hikui oka 
Miwatasu keshiki wa Souzou to chigau 
Ano koro to kurabe Mae ni susumeta? 
Kotae wa NO ja nai Dakedo tarinai 
Ijiwaru na "Kami" ga Bokura tamesunda 
Kuuseki wo umete Tsugi no suteeji e mukaou 
"Donna kankei?" nante kikaretara 
Tomodachi ijou ka na... Sore mo sukoshi chigau ka... 
"Kizuna" to iu kotoba ga fusawashii 
Kenkashiai nagara Wakachiai nagara 
"Nee ima, doko?" "Chikyuun naka" 
Uchuuhikoushi ja nai kara 
Ozon (ozone) yori shita nara mondai nai 
"Wakatteru, sugu iku" 
Asa made sawagitai no deshou 
 
Taisetsu na ibasho de 
 A short hill where the Milky Way appears, 
the landscape I look out over is different from what I’d imagined, 
Have we moved forward since those times? 
The answer isn't NO but it's not enough, 
A malicious "god" is testing us, 
let’s fill up the empty seat and head to the next stage 
When asked "What kind of relationship do you have?" 
I say "Maybe a little more than just friends"... but that's not quite right either... the word "bond" is more appropriate, 
while fighting with each other, while breaking off relations with one another, 
"Hey, where are you right now?" "Somewhere on Earth" 
I’m not an astronaut 
so if it's anywhere beneath the ozone, it's no problem! 
"Got it, I'll be there soon" 
Do I want to cause a disturbance until morning 
 
in those important whereabouts?
