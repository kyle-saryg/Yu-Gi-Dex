 Design 
 Personality 
 He is a character who loves Dueling and is excited to be in a completely new environment. He is always filled with energy. He is also shown to get ahead of himself often, as when he Dueled  Zuzu , he announced  drawing  a  Pendulum Monster , and placed both active Pendulum Monsters in his  Monster Zones  rather than the  Pendulum Zones .
 Even when things don't go his way he is never shown without optimism, and actually tries to make the best out of everything he experiences, often mentioning that he "will learn from that" when something excites or amuses him in particular.
 
 Appearance 
 Halil wears a red and orange vest with a black t-shirt. He has a small yellow and orange hat and green scarf. Not only does he wear multiple gold earrings, Halil also has long puffy black hair. His hair has a few bangs in front of his face. He has dark skin and brown eyes.
 
 Voice/Mannerisms 
 In the original, Halil speaks with an accent indicative of a foreigner learning Japanese, by using non-standard pronunciations, while in the dub, he speaks with a strong English accent.
 
 Biography 
 Arc League Championship 
 On the day of the third round, Halil and the other contestants were informed that the third round would be a city-wide  Battle Royal , with participation determined by the  Pendulum Monsters  that the contestants found. [2] 
 His first Duel was against  Zuzu Boyle  in the Iceberg Area of the Action Field, who he gave a Pendulum Monster beforehand because she only had one of the required two. Halil was able to take the card back during the Duel with a card effect. While Zuzu reached for an Action Card, she ended up sliding off the ice shelf and into  Olga , who was Dueling  Gong  at the time, resulting in both Duels being combined into a  Tag-Team Duel  with Zuzu being paired with Gong. [1]  After Gong was defeated, Zuzu proceeded to defeat both Halil and Olga. [3] 
 After their Duel with Zuzu and Gong, Halil and Olga walked through the Jungle Area. They encountered  Trout  and  Reed Pepper  and challenged Reed to a Duel. [4]  Even though Hail Summoned his ace monster, Reed activated the  effects  of his " Royal Cookpals " to  destroy  his opponents' monsters, then used " Metabolic Storm " to inflict  damage  to them equal to the ATK of the destroyed monsters. As per the ante rules, Trout took the Pendulum cards that Halil and Olga wagered, much to their disgust, as Trout hadn't even Dueled. [5] 
 Later, Halil and Olga slid down an ice board on the Ice Field, nearly crashing into  Yuri  and  Dennis McField . The LID pair mistook Yuri for a Battle Royal participant and challenged him to a Duel. Yuri was irritated by their intrusion, but he accepted anyway. He defeated Halil and Olga and  sealed them   into cards , which he gave to Zuzu. [6] 
 
 Friendship Cup 
 When Zuzu and  Yugo  tried to warn  New Domino City 's residents about  Duel Academy 's invasion, Zuzu showed them the cards containing Halil and Olga, no one believed them. [7] 
 
 Duel Academy 
 After  Z-ARC 's defeat and the  Standard Dimension  being reborn into the  "Pendulum Dimension" , Halil was freed from his  card . [8]  He is seen watching Yuya's Duel against  Jack Atlas  with  Olga [9]  and applauded when Yuya won. He then watched Yuya and  Declan 's  Action Duel . [10]  He was happy when Yuya won the Duel and witnessed  Zuzu 's revival. [11] 
 
 Deck 
 Halil uses a  " Lamp "  Deck, focused around  burn   effects  and  Fusion Summoning . His  monsters ' effects allow him to quickly gather the tools needed to Fusion Summon as well as rapidly inflict  effect damage  to his opponent(s).
