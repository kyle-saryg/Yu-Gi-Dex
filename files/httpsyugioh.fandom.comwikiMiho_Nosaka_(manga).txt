 Biography 
       Miho turns Honda down.     
 Hiroto Honda  had a crush on her and bought a  love jigsaw puzzle  from  Sugoroku Mutou , the grandfather of  Yugi Mutou , as a gift for Miho. He got Yugi to write a love letter to Miho on the puzzle, that would be revealed on completion, for him. Yugi,  Jonouchi  and Honda put the puzzle on Miho's desk before class. Later, a beautiful teacher named  Ms. Chono  decided to do a desk check. When she found the puzzle, she asked who it was from. Yugi, Jonouchi, and Honda all confessed, so Chono decided to solve it to find out which one it was from, after announcing she will expel the person who made the puzzle. All the attention drawn to herself caused Miho to be greatly embarrassed which caused Honda great grief. [1] 
 Dark Yugi  came out and turned the jigsaw in a Shadow Game, causing Chono to feel the pain she was inflicting on others as she solved the jigsaw. When she solved the puzzle, her makeup peeled away, revealing an ugly face. Embarrassed, Chono ran out of the classroom. [1] 
 Miho turned down Honda after he directly asked her out. Afterwards, Yugi and Jonouchi bought him a hamburger to cheer him up, and Honda became friends with Yugi. [1]
