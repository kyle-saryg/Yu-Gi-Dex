 Karim  (神官カリム  Shinkan Karimu ) is one of the six  Sacred Guardians  that served under  Pharaoh Atem  in Ancient Egypt 3000 years ago during his reign, and was the owner of the  Millennium Scales  at the time.
 A powerful and incredibly loyal man, Karim was dedicated to serve the Pharaoh, going as far as even sacrificing his life for him. A powerful Priest, he seemed to partner up with  Seto  and often fused their  Ka 's together. He fought alongside Atem and the others when Bakura waged war on Egypt, but ultimately died in the conflict; heavily wounded, he gives up the last of his life force to  Shada  in order to ensure he will continue to protect the Pharaoh.
 
 Biography 
 Karim is a Priest serving  Pharaoh Atem . When  Thief King Bakura  raided the palace, he attempted to fight off against him, but failed. Bakura later fled when Atem Summoned " Obelisk the Tormentor ". He took part in the fight in  Kul Elna  against Bakura and his  Diabound . He was severely weakened by Bakura. When Bakura separated the Priests from each other, he gave the last of his  ba  to  Shada  so he could fight off against the " Giant Axe Mummy ".
