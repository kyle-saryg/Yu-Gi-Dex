 Earthbound Spell 
 
 Earthbound Immortal Wiraqocha Rasca , known as  Earthbound God Wiraqocha Rasca  (地縛神 Ｗｉｒａｑｏｃｈａ Ｒａｓｃａ,  Jibakushin Wirakocha Rasuka ) in the Japanese version is a character version of the card " Earthbound Immortal Wiraqocha Rasca ". It is one of the " Earthbound Immortals ", and it is said to be the strongest of them. It is used by  Rex Goodwin , representing the power of darkness that he seeks to control. 
 
 Appearance 
 Like all "Earthbound Immortals", "Wiraqocha Rasca" is a gigantic black, exaggerated animal with a secondary color; "Wiraqocha Rasca" is a condor with a pink secondary color. "Wiraqocha Rasca" is the only "Earthbound Immortal" to have a part of its body that is neither black, nor its associated secondary color; "Wiraqocha Rasca" has a white fur ruff surrounding the base of its neck and glowing yellow eyes. "Wiraqocha Rasca" is one of the largest of the "Earthbound Immortals". "Wiraqocha Rasca" has powerful legs, with talon-less toes, and three stalks protuding from the back of its head. The massive wingspan of "Wiraqocha Rasca" makes up most of its bulk; both the wings and its tail are three times the length of the body. The tail is made of of around twenty long black strands; the wings have long feathers extending from the sides and base, with pink designs on the main area of the wings and a large spike extending from the "elbow".
 
 Biography 
 Rex Goodwin  traveled to the  B.A.D.   Ener-D  Reactor to Duel  Roman Goodwin , where he intentionally allowed Roman to defeat him, killing himself in order to gain the power of a  Dark Signer , and thus use the power of the  King of the Netherworld  to destroy the world, then use the power of the  Crimson Dragon  to remake it. As Rex expired, he saw a black condor flying towards him; and thus came into possession of "Wiraqocha Rasca".
 Rex Summoned "Wiraqocha Rasca" during his  Turbo Duel  against  Crow Hogan ,  Jack Atlas , and  Yusei Fudo , taking the souls of hundreds of  New Domino City  citizens to fuel it. Its Summoning prompted the approaching King of the Netherworld to attack the Duelists with multiple condors, and Rex swiftly brought the Duel under his control with the powerful effect of "Wiraqocha Rasca". "Wiraqocha Rasca" took both Jack and Crow down to 1  LP  and eliminated them from the Duel, but Yusei remained in the game despite "Wiraqocha Rasca" reducing his LP to 1 as well. Yusei was eventually able to Summon " Majestic Star Dragon ", negating the effect of "Wiraqocha Rasca" and destroying both it and the King of the Netherworld.
