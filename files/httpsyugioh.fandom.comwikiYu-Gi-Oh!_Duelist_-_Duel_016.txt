 Summary 
       Dark Yugi , surprised to see the  ventriloquist  play " Blue-Eyes White Dragon ".     
 Much to  Dark Yugi 's surprise the  ventriloquist  has just  Summoned  " Blue-Eyes White Dragon ", a card which is only owned by the real  Seto Kaiba .  Mokuba  warns Dark Yugi to be careful;  Industrial Illusions  sent a spy to steal Kaiba's Deck.
 Saruwatari  thinks to himself that this is just the beginning; even if Dark Yugi defeats the ventriloquist, there are plenty of other  Player Killers  mixed in with the Duelists brought to  the island .
 The ventriloquist silently laughs and thinks that Dark Yugi cannot win, as his guilt and Kaiba's cards will smother him. He gets the  Kaiba puppet  to claim that he is really Kaiba borrowing the body of a doll, so that he can get his revenge on Dark Yugi. Dark Yugi starts to wonder if part of Kaiba's soul, which contains his undying grudge and thirst for vengeance, really is part of the doll. He wonders if Kaiba will always be his arch-rival.  Jonouchi  tells Dark Yugi to calm down and  Honda  insists that the it is just the ventriloquist throwing his voice.
 As the Duel continues, the ventriloquist has the puppet forfeit his attack to play a card  face-down  instead and laugh that soon Dark Yugi's monsters will have nowhere to run. Dark Yugi begins his turn and wonders if the face-down is a  Spell  or  Trap Card . Since his " Dark Magician " isn't powerful enough to compete with the "Blue-Eyes White Dragon" in battle, he switches it to  Defense Mode . He also Summons " Curse of Dragon " in Defense Mode. The puppet laughs that he knew Dark Yugi would do that and says that it won't save him, as he activates his face-down Trap Card, " Stop Defense ". This switches Dark Yugi's monsters to  Attack Mode , meaning that he can take damage to his Life Points if they're destroyed in battle. On the ventriloquist's turn, "Blue-Eyes White Dragon" uses its " Burst Stream " attack to destroy "Curse of Dragon", dropping Dark Yugi's Life Points to 1000.
 Dark Yugi starts to panic and wonders how he can win now. Saruwatari laughs and comments that he bets Kaiba is happy if he's watching from Heaven. Mokuba's eyes began to tear and he angrily says that his brother isn't dead. Dark Yugi had told him before that Kaiba would come back and he had believed him, Mokuba says and asks Dark Yugi where he is, as he has been waiting a long time. Dark Yugi thinks that Mokuba is right and he too has faith in Kaiba. He thinks to himself that he won't lose and begins his next turn.
 
       Dark Yugi hides his cards with " Magical Hats ".     
 Dark Yugi activates " Magical Hats ", hiding "Dark Magician" under one of four hats. "Blue-Eyes White Dragon" can only attack once per turn, so Dark Yugi hopes it attacks an empty hat. The ventriloquist begins his turn and has the "Blue-Eyes White Dragon" attack a hat, which turns out to be empty. On his next turn, Dark Yugi plays another card. The ventriloquist can't see the card and wonders if it went under one of the hats. Dark Yugi explains that there are three top hats remaining; if the ventriloquist attacks the right one, he'll destroy "Dark Magician", but if he chooses the wrong hat, he'll activate the Trap Card that was just Set. The ventriloquist attacked the middle hat. However this contained the Trap Card, " Spellbinding Circle ", which ensnared the "Blue-Eyes White Dragon" within a hexagram and reduced its  ATK  from 3000 to 2300. With the dragon weakened, Dark Yugi got "Dark Magician" to emerge from its hat and attack and destroy "Blue-Eyes White Dragon" with its "Black Magic" attack. The ventriloquist's Life Points drop to 700 and Dark Yugi's friends celebrate him beating what they believe to be the world's rarest card.
 
         Kaiba  wakes from his coma.     
 Much to Dark Yugi's surprise the "Blue-Eyes White Dragon" reappears and destroys "Dark Magician", dropping him to 500 Life Points. The ventriloquist has the puppet ask what the matter is and remind Dark Yugi that Kaiba has three "Blue-Eyes White Dragon" cards and he just after playing the second one. Thinking that there are no cards in his Deck that can defeat a "Blue-Eyes White Dragon", Dark Yugi thinks he has lost. He Summons " Feral Imp " and ends his turn. The ventriloquist laughs that this is the end and declares an attack on "Feral Imp". However the dragon refuses to attack. Standing up and disregarding the puppet, he demands to know what was happening. The dragon then begins to disappear. He wonders what's going and drops the puppet. Dark Yugi suspects that this is to do with the real Kaiba.
 Meanwhile in  Kaiba Manor , Kaiba awakes from his coma and steps out of his wheelchair.  His maid  was just about to enter the room as this happened and she dropped her tray in surprise to see him awake. Kaiba looks out the window and thinks "Yugi...".

 Anime adaption 
 In the  Yu-Gi-Oh!  second series anime , parts of the ninth episode, " " Duel With a Ghoul " " and beginning of the tenth episode " " Give up the Ghost " " are based on this chapter. There are a number of differences including:
 
 Yami Yugi  (Dark Yugi) Dueled  Ghost Kaiba , who disguised himself as Kaiba, rather than the  Ventriloquist of the Dead . 
 Kaiba  was not in a coma. During the Duel, he was in a secret chamber outside  Kaiba Manor , where he hacked into Pegasus' computer system and searched for Yugi's Duel. 
 Pegasus  was shown to be watching the Duel and also sent some men to capture Kaiba. 
 Ghost Kaiba mentioned that were only four " Blue-Eyes White Dragon " cards in the world and that he, while pretending to be Kaiba, ripped it up the fourth one. 
 The destruction of the "Blue-Eyes White Dragon" was caused by Kaiba infecting its  Solid Vision  with a virus.
