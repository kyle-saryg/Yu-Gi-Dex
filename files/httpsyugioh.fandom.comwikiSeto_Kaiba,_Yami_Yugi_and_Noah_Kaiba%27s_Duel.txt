 Featured Duel: Seto Kaiba/Yami Yugi and Noah Kaiba's Duel 
 Turn 1: Seto 
Seto draws. He then  Normal Summons  " Giant Germ " (1000/100) in  Attack Position  and  Sets  a card ("Crush Card Virus").
 Turn 2: Noah 
 
       The effect of "Chiron the Mage" activates.     
 Noah draws. He then Normal Summons " Chiron the Mage " (1800/1000) in Attack Position. Noah then  activates  the effect of "Chiron the Mage" to  destroy   Seto 's  face-down  " Crush Card ". "Chiron the Mage" attacks and destroys "Giant Germ" (Seto 4000 → 3200). Since "Giant Germ" was destroyed in battle and sent to the Graveyard, its effect activates, inflicting 500  damage  to  Noah  (Noah 4000 → 3500) and allowing Seto to  Special Summon  another "Giant Germ" (1000/100) in Attack Position.
 Turn 3: Seto 
Seto draws. He then  Tributes  "Giant Germ" in order to Tribute Summon " Vampire Lord " (2000/1500) in Attack Position. "Vampire Lord" attacks and destroys "Chiron the Mage" (Noah 3500 → 3300). Since "Vampire Lord" inflicted  Battle Damage , its effect activates, allowing Seto to declare a card type and force Noah to send a card of that type from his Deck to the Graveyard. Seto declares " Monster ", so Noah  sends  " Giant Soldier of Stone " from his  Deck  to the  Graveyard .
 Turn 4: Noah 
Noah draws. He then activates " Fissure " to destroy "Vampire Lord". Noah then Normal Summons " Aeris " (1800/1400) in Attack Position. "Aeris" attacks  directly  (Seto 3200 → 1400). Noah then Sets a card.
 Turn 5: Seto 
Seto draws. On Seto's Standby Phase, he activates the second effect of "Vampire Lord" to revive itself (2000/1500) in Attack Position as it was previously destroyed by an opponent's card effect. Seto then Normal Summons " Slate Warrior " (1900/400) in Attack Position. "Vampire Lord" attacks "Aeris", but Noah activates his face-down " Earthshaker " to pick  DARK  and  WIND  as the  Attributes  targets for "Earthshaker's" effect and force Seto to choose one of the picked Attributes. After Seto declares an Attribute, all monsters of that Attribute are immediately destroyed. Seto chooses DARK, so "Vampire Lord" is destroyed. "Slate Warrior" attacks and destroys "Aeris" (Noah 3300 → 3200).
 Turn 6: Noah 
Noah draws. He then activates " Giant Flood " to destroy all monsters on the field and forcing both players to discard every monster in their hands to the Graveyard. At this point, Noah reveals his  Deck Master : " Shinato's Ark ". Due to the Deck Master Ability of "Shinato's Ark", any monsters that are sent to the Graveyard can be absorbed into "Shinato's Ark" instead. Noah also reveals to Seto that the monsters that are currently in the Graveyard have all been absorbed into "Shinato's Ark".
 Seto has 1400  Life Points  remaining and controls no cards.
 Noah has 3200 Life Points remaining and controls no cards.
 Turn 6: Noah 
After revealing his  Deck Master  to be " Shinato's Ark ",  Noah  activates the  Deck Master ability  of "Shinato's Ark" to add all the monsters that are currently in the Graveyard into itself.
 Turn 7: Seto 
Seto's hand contains "Dragon's Rage", " Ring of Destruction ", " Ring of Defense ", and " Quick Attack ". Seto draws " Spear Dragon " and subsequently Normal Summons it (1900/0) in Attack Position. "Spear Dragon" attacks directly, but Noah activates his Deck Master's ability to  Special Summon  " Vampire Lord " (2000/1500) to his side of the field in  Defense Position  and have it intercept the attack. "Spear Dragon" destroys "Vampire Lord" and inflicts piercing damage to Noah (Noah 3200 → 2800). "Vampire Lord" returns into Noah's "Shinato's Ark". Since "Spear Dragon" attacked, its secondary effect switches it to Defense Position at the end of the Damage Step.
 Turn 8: Noah 
Noah draws. He then Normal Summons " Giant Rex " (2000/1200) in Attack Position. "Giant Rex" attacks and destroys "Spear Dragon". "Spear Dragon" goes into Noah's "Shinato's Ark".
 Turn 9: Seto 
Seto draws " Pot of Greed " and subsequently activates it to draw two cards. Seto then activates the Deck Master Ability of " Kaiser Sea Horse " to allow himself to summon a  LIGHT  monster in his hand with one less tribute this turn. Seto Normal Summons " Different Dimension Dragon " (1400/1500) in Defense Position and sets three cards.
 Turn 10: Noah 
Noah draws " Deepest Impact " and subsequently activates it to destroy all monsters on the field and halve both players'  Life Points  (Noah 2800 → 1400; Seto 1400 → 700). "Giant Rex" goes into Noah's "Shinato's Ark". Since "Different Dimension Dragon" cannot be destroyed by the effects of Magic or  Trap Cards  that don't have a specific target, it remains on the field. Noah then activates " Ice Age Panic " to Special Summon " Last Tusk Mammoth " (800/1200) in Attack Position. 
 "Last Tusk Mammoth" attacks "Different Dimension Dragon". Noah explains to Seto that when "Last Tusk Mammoth" battles a monster, all Battle Damage that Noah would take will be inflicted to Seto instead. Seto then activates his face-down "Ring of Destruction" to destroy "Last Tusk Mammoth" and inflict its ATK as damage to both players. Seto then activates his face-down "Ring of Defense" to prevent himself from taking the damage inflicted by the effect of "Ring of Destruction" (Noah 1400 → 600).
 Turn 11: Seto 
Seto draws. He then switches "Different Dimension Dragon" to  Attack Position . Seto then discards " Thunder Dragon " from his hand via its own effect in order to add two "Thunder Dragons" from his  Deck  to his  hand . The discarded "Thunder Dragon" goes into "Shinato's Ark". Seto then activates " Polymerization " to fuse his two "Thunder Dragons" together and Fusion Summon " Twin-Headed Thunder Dragon " (2800/2100) in Attack Position. The two "Thunder Dragons" that were just used go into Noah's "Shinato's Ark". Seto then activates " Quick Attack " to allow "Twin-Headed Thunder Dragon" to attack this turn (NOTE: In real life this is not necessary, but this Duel follows the  Battle City Rules ). Noah activates the Deck Master Ability of "Shinato's Ark" to Special Summon " Giant Soldier of Stone " (1300/2000) and "Giant Rex" (2000/1200) in Defense Position. 
 Seto then activates his face-down " Dragon's Rage " to allow his  Dragon - Type  monsters to inflict piercing damage this turn. "Different Dimension Dragon" attacks and destroys "Giant Rex". "Different Dimension Dragon" then inflicts piercing damage to Noah (Noah 600 → 400). "Giant Rex" goes back into "Shinato's Ark". Seto is about to use "Twin-Headed Thunder Dragon" to attack "Giant Soldier of Stone", but Noah uses a brain-washed  Mokuba  as a shield to protect himself. Seto has to choose whether to continue his attack and hurt Mokuba, or stop the attack and possibly lose the Duel and control of  Kaiba Corporation .
 Seto has 700  Life Points  remaining and controls "Different Dimension Dragon" (1400/1500) and "Twin-Headed Thunder Dragon" (2800/2100) in Attack Position. Both monsters are affected by the effect of " Dragon's Rage ".
 Noah has 400 Life Points remaining and controls "Giant Soldier of Stone" (1300/2000) in Defense Position.
 Turn 11: Seto 
 Noah  has just summoned a brain-washed  Mokuba  to use as a shield to protect himself just as  Seto  was about to attack " Giant Soldier of Stone " with " Twin-Headed Thunder Dragon ". Seto calls off his attack.
 Turn 12: Noah 
Noah draws. He then activates his  Deck Master 's secondary effect to remove every monster in " Shinato's Ark " from play and increase his  Life Points  by 500 for each one. Twelve monsters are removed from play (Noah 400 → 6400). Noah then activates " Dark Hole " to destroy all monsters on the field (Seto's " Different Dimension Dragon " stays in play because "Dark Hole" doesn't target it). "Giant Soldier of Stone" and "Twin-Headed Thunder Dragon" go into "Shinato's Ark".
 Turn 13: Seto 
Seto draws. He then switches "Different Dimension Dragon" to  Defense Position .
 Turn 14: Noah 
Noah draws. He then Normal Summons " Gradius " (1200/800) in Attack Position. Noah then activates " Cyclon Laser ", equipping it to "Gradius" and increasing its ATK by 300 ("Gradius": 1200 → 1500/800). Now "Gradius" can inflict piercing damage to Seto when it attacks a Defense Position monster. Noah then activates " Matter Leveler " and equips it to "Gradius". Now when "Gradius" attacks a Defense Position monster, the ATK of "Gradius" will become equal to the DEF of the that monster plus 100 during damage calculation only. 
 "Gradius" attacks "Different Dimension Dragon". The effect of "Matter Leveler" activates ("Gradius": 1500 → 1600/800). "Different Dimension Dragon" is not destroyed due to "Gradius" not having at least 2000 ATK, but due to the effect of "Cyclon Laser", "Gradius" inflicts piercing damage to Seto (Seto 700 → 600). After damage calculation, the effect of "Matter Leveler" expires ("Gradius": 1600 → 1500/800).
 Turn 15: Seto 
Seto draws. He then passes his turn.
 Turn 16: Noah 
Noah draws "Gradius' Option". Since Noah controls "Gradius", he Special Summons " Gradius' Option " (?/?) in Attack Position. Due to the effect of "Gradius' Option", it gains the same ATK,  DEF , and effects that Noah's "Gradius" already has (? → 1500/? → 800). 
 "Gradius" attacks "Different Dimension Dragon". The effect of "Matter Leveler" activates ("Gradius": 1500 → 1600/800). "Different Dimension Dragon" is not destroyed due to "Gradius" not having at least 2000 ATK, but due to the effect of "Cyclon Laser", "Gradius" inflicts piercing damage to Seto (Seto 600 → 500). After damage calculation, the effect of "Matter Leveler" expires ("Gradius": 1600 → 1500/800). 
 "Gradius' Option" attacks "Different Dimension Dragon". The effect of "Matter Leveler" activates ("Gradius' Option": 1500 → 1600/800). "Different Dimension Dragon" is not destroyed due to "Gradius' Option" not having at least 2000 ATK, but due to the effect of "Cyclon Laser", "Gradius' Option" inflicts piercing damage to Seto (Seto 500 → 400). After damage calculation, the effect of "Matter Leveler" expires ("Gradius' Option": 1600 → 1500/800). At this point, Yugi and Seto both try to get Mokuba to come back to his senses. Mokuba starts to break ahold of Noah's possession.
 Turn 17: Seto 
Seto draws "Blue-Eyes White Dragon". He then sets a card. Seto then activates the  Deck Master Ability  of " Kaiser Sea Horse " to allow himself to Normal Summon a  LIGHT  monster with one less tribute. Seto Tributes "Different Dimension Dragon" in order to Tribtue Summon " Blue-Eyes White Dragon " (3000/2500) in Attack Position. "Different Dimension Dragon" goes into "Shinato's Ark". 
 Upon seeing "Blue-Eyes White Dragon", Mokuba snaps out of Noah's mind control and immediately goes back to Seto's side. "Blue-Eyes White Dragon" attacks and destroys "Gradius" (Noah 6400 → 4900). Since "Gradius" was destroyed, "Gradius' Option" is destroyed too due to the latter's final effect. Both "Gradius" and "Gradius' Option" go into "Shinato's Ark".
 Turn 18: Noah 
Noah activates "Shinato Ark's" Deck Master Ability to remove all monsters in "Shinato's Ark" from play and gain 500 Life Points for each one removed. Five monsters are removed from play (Noah 4900 → 7400). Noah draws. Seto then activates his face-down " Last Turn ", forcing both players to discard their entire hands and choose a monster on their side of the field to battle. Seto chooses "Blue-Eyes White Dragon" while Noah chooses "Shinato's Ark". Both monsters will then battle each other. All Battle Damage from this Battle Phase will be nullified and whichever player that has the monster that remains standing after the battle will be the winner. 
 "Blue-Eyes White Dragon" attacks and destroys "Shinato's Ark". The final Deck Master Ability of "Shinato's Ark" then activates, allowing Noah to Special Summon " Shinato, King of a Higher Plane " (3300/3000) in Attack Position and make it Noah's new Deck Master. "Shinato, King of a Higher Plane" attacks and destroys Seto's "Blue-Eyes White Dragon." Due to the effect of "Last Turn", Noah wins the Duel by default as his monster was still standing by the End Phase.
 Noah then turns the Kaiba Brothers to stone. Angered,  Yugi Muto  changes into  Yami Yugi  and offers to continue the duel, in which Noah accepts.
 Turn 19: Yami Yugi 
Yami Yugi draws " Gazelle the King of Mythical Beasts " and subsequently Normal Summons it (1500/1200) in  Defense Position .
 Turn 20: Noah 
Noah draws, intending to get a monster, but he doesn't draw a monster. " Shinato, King of a Higher Plane " attacks and destroys "Gazelle". The first  Deck Master ability  of "Shinato" then activates, halving Yami Yugi's  Life Points  (Yugi 400 → 200). Since Yami Yugi's Life Points were reduced, the second Deck Master ability of "Shinato" activates, increasing Noah's Life Points by the amount Yami Yugi lost (Noah 7400 → 7600).
 Turn 21: Yami Yugi 
Yami Yugi draws a monster and subsequently sets it.
 Turn 22: Noah 
Noah draws " Yata-Garasu " and subsequently Normal Summons it (200/100) in  Attack Position . "Shinato" attacks Yugi's set monster, " Obnoxious Celtic Guardian " (1400/1200), but the latter isn't destroyed due to its own effect. Noah then activates " Spring of Rebirth ". Now every time a monster returns to its owner's hand Noah will gain 500 Life Points. At the End Phase, "Yata-Garasu" returns to Noah's hand due to its own effect (Noah 7600 → 8100).
 Turn 23: Yami Yugi 
Yami Yugi draws a monster and subsequently sets it.
 Turn 24: Noah 
Noah draws " Asura Priest " and subsequently Normal Summons it (1700/1200) in Attack Position. "Asura" attacks and destroys "Obnoxious Celtic Guardian". Due to the effect of "Asura", it can attack every monster on Yugi's side of the field once each. "Asura" attacks & destroys Yugi's set monster, " Cyber Jar ". Since "Cyber Jar" was flipped, its Flip Effect activates, destroying all monsters on the field and forcing both players to draw five new cards and  Special Summon  any  Level  4 or lower monsters that they drew. Yami Yugi reminds Noah that since "Shinato" has been moved to the field, he will lose when the effect of "Cyber Jar" destroys "Shinato". 
 Noah then activates his Deck Master's third special ability, saving "Shinato, King of a Higher Plane" from destruction by returning it to Noah's side. However it cannot move back to the field for the remainder of the Duel. After "Asura" and "Cyber Jar" go to the Graveyard, Yugi and Noah draw five cards and Special Summon any Level 4 or below monsters they drew. Yugi draws " Sangan " (1000/600) and " Gamma The Magnet Warrior " (1500/1800) and subsequently Special Summons them both in Defense Position. Due to the effect of "Cyber Jar", the only monsters Noah has drawn are  Spirit monsters , and since they cannot be Special Summoned, all the cards he drew are added to his hand.
 Turn 25: Yami Yugi 
Yami Yugi draws. He then Tributes his two monsters in order to Tribute Summon " Dark Magician " (2500/2100) in Attack Position. Since "Sangan" was sent from the field to the  Graveyard , its effect activates, allowing Yami Yugi to add " Big Shield Gardna " from his  Deck  to his hand. Yami Yugi's hand contains "Big Shield Gardna", " Dark Magic Ritual ", " Valkyrion the Magna Warrior ", and " Swords of Revealing Light ". "Dark Magician" attacks directly (Noah 8100 → 5600).
 Turn 26: Noah 
Noah draws " Next World " and subsequently activates it to select Yugi's "Dark Magician" ( Level  7) and  Normal Summon  one Spirit monster from his hand with the same Level as the selected monster without any Tributes. Noah Normal Summons  Yamata Dragon " (2600/3100) in Attack Position without any Tributes. Noah's hand contains " Yata-Garasu ", " Sebek's Blessing ", " Otohime ", " Great Long Nose ", and " Pyro Clock of Destiny ". " Yamata Dragon " attacks and destroys "Dark Magician" (Yugi 200 → 100; Noah 5600 → 5700). At the End Phase, "Yamata Dragon" returns to Noah's hand due to its own effect (Noah 5700 → 6200).
 Turn 27: Yami Yugi

 Turn 28: Noah 
Noah draws a monster and subsequently sets it.
 Turn 29: Yami Yugi

 Turn 31: Yami Yugi 
Yami Yugi draws " Nutrient Z ". He then Sets a card.
 Turn 32: Noah 
At this point, Noah gets tired of Yugi's friends cheering him and turns  Duke Devlin  to stone to discourage them from cheering. Noah draws. He then activates his face-down " Pyro Clock of Destiny " to skip the turn count by one, thus destroying "Swords of Revealing Light" one turn sooner. Noah then  Flip Summons  " Otohime " (0/100) to Attack Position. Since "Otohime" was flipped face-up, its effect activates, allowing Noah to switch "Kuriboh" to Attack Position. Noah then Tributes his two monsters in order to Tribute Summon "Yamata Dragon" (2600/3100) in Attack Position. "Yamata Dragon" then attacks "Kuriboh".
 Yami Yugi has 100  Life Points  remaining and controls "Big Shield Gardna" (100/2600) and "Kuriboh" (300/200) in Attack Position and one set card.
 Noah has 8200 Life Points remaining and controls "Yamata Dragon" (2600/3100) in Attack Position and " Spring of Rebirth ".
 Turn 32: Noah 
Noah's " Yamata Dragon " has just attacked " Kuriboh ", but Yugi activates his face-down " Nutrient Z " to increase his  Life Points  by 4000 before  Damage calculation  (Yugi 100 → 4100). "Yamata Dragon" then destroys "Kuriboh" (Yami Yugi 4100 → 1800; Noah 5900 → 8200). Noah then activates " Sebek's Blessing " to gain Life Points equal to the Battle Damage Yugi just took (Noah 8200 → 10500). At the End Phase, "Yamata Dragon" returns to Noah's hand due to its own effect (Noah 10500 → 11000).
 Turn 33: Yami Yugi 
Yami Yugi draws " Alpha The Magnet Warrior " and subsequently Normal Summons it (1400/1700) in  Attack Position . "Alpha the Magnet Warrior" attacks directly (Noah 11000 → 9600).
 Turn 34: Noah 
Angered that he failed to defeat Yugi in his previous turn, Noah decides to turn one of Yugi's friends to stone for every turn he takes, starting with  Tristan Taylor . Noah draws " Inaba White Rabbit " and subsequently Normal Summons it (700/500) in Attack Position. "Inaba White Rabbit" attacks directly via its own effect (Yugi 1800 → 1100; Noah 9600 → 10300). At the End Phase, "Inaba White Rabbit" returns to Noah's hand due to its own effect (Noah 10300 → 10800).
 Turn 35: Yami Yugi 
Yami Yugi draws " Dark Renewal ". He then Sets a card ("Dark Renewal"). Yami Yugi then Tributes "Alpha The Magnet Warrior" in order to Tribute Summon " Dark Magician Girl " (2000/1700) in Attack Position. Since there is one " Dark Magician " in Yugi's  Graveyard , "Dark Magician Girl" gains 300  ATK  due to its own effect ("Dark Magician Girl": 2000 → 2300/1700). "Dark Magician Girl" attacks directly (Noah 10800 → 8500).
 Turn 36: Noah 
At this point, Noah turns  Serenity Wheeler  to stone. Noah draws. He then Normal Summons "Inaba White Rabbit" (700/500) in Attack Position. Yugi then activates his face-down "Dark Renewal" to " Big Shield Gardna " and Noah's "Inaba White Rabbit" and  Special Summon  "Dark Magician" from his Graveyard (2500/2100) in Attack Position ("Dark Magician Girl": 2300 → 2000/1700). Noah then sets a card.
 Turn 37: Yami Yugi 
Yami Yugi draws " Magician of Black Chaos ". He then activates " Dark Magic Ritual " to Tribute " Valkyrion the Magna Warrior " from his hand and  Ritual Summon  "Magician of Black Chaos" (2800/2600) in Attack Position. "Dark Magician", "Dark Magician Girl", and "Magician of Black Chaos" all attack directly, but Noah activates his face-down " Chaos Barrier Field " to negate the attack and force "Magician of Black Chaos" and "Dark Magician Girl" to battle instead. "Magician of Black Chaos" destroys "Dark Magician Girl" (Yugi 1100 → 300; Noah 8500 → 9300). The last effect of "Chaos Barrier Field" then ends the Battle Phase.
 Turn 38: Noah 
At this point, he offers Yugi to forfeit the Duel. If he does so, he'll free everyone except Seto and Mokuba. However,  Joey Wheeler  interferes and says that Seto would want him to win even though they're rivals. Not wanting any interference, Noah turns Joey to stone. Yami Yugi then refuses the offer and the Duel continues. Noah draws. He then sets a monster and sets two cards (He arrogantly shows Yugi one of them, " Ground Breaking ", boasting that knowing what it was wouldn't help him).
 Turn 39: Yami Yugi 
Yami Yugi draws  Card Destruction . Noah activates his face-down "Ground Breaking" to add "Inaba White Rabbit" from his Graveyard to his hand. Noah intends to summon "Inaba White Rabbit" on his next turn, so he can use it to attack directly through its own effect and win. Yami Yugi then activates "Card Destruction" to force both players to discard their hands and draw the same amount of cards they discarded. (At this point, Yami Yugi's hand is empty, so he doesn't have any cards to discard.)
 "Magician of Black Chaos" attacks and destroys Noah's set monster. It is revealed to be " Otohime ". Since "Otohime" was flipped face-up, its effect activates, allowing Noah to switch "Dark Magician" to  Defense Position . Noah then activates his face-down " Vessel of Illusion " to Special Summon a " Spirit Token " with the same  Level ,  Type ,  Attribute , ATK and  DEF  as the Spirit Monster that was just destroyed (0/100) in Defense Position.
 Turn 40: Noah 
Noah draws. He then almost turns  Téa Gardner  to stone, but she still shows confidence and cheers for Yugi. He then lets her stay until the end of his turn. Noah then activates " Change of Heart " to take control of Yugi's "Dark Magician" until the end of the turn. Noah then Tributes "Dark Magician" and his "Spirit Token" in order to Tribute  Hino-Kagu-Tsuchi " (2800/2900) in Attack Position. He then activates " Flaming Fist ", increasing "Hino-Kagu-Tsuchi's" ATK by 200 ("Hino-Kagu-Tsuchi": 2800 → 3000/2900). Now if "Hino-Kagu-Tsuchi" inflicts Battle Damage this turn, "Flaming Fist" will increase Noah's Life Points by 500. 
 "Hino-Kagu-Tsuchi" attacks and destroys "Magician of Black Chaos" (Yugi 300 → 100; Noah 9300 → 9500). The second effect of "Flaming Fist" activates (Noah 9500 → 10000). Noah then activates " Spiritual Energy Settle Machine ". Now any and all of Noah's Spirit monsters like "Hino-Kagu-Tsuchi" will remain face-up on the field and they don't return to his hand on the End Phase even if they were Normal Summoned or flipped face-up. Also during each of his End Phases, he must discard a card to keep "Spiritual Energy Settle Machine" on the field or else it will be destroyed. 
 On Noah's End Phase, he discards a card to keep "Spiritual Energy Settle Machine" in play. At the same time, the effect of "Flaming Fist" expires ("Hino-Kagu-Tsuchi": 3000 → 2800/2900). Noah keeps his word and turns Téa to stone. At this point, Yami Yugi is about to give up, but Yugi shows him that his friends are always with him and are still counting on him. This is enough to encourage Yami Yugi to continue the Duel.
 Turn 41: Yami Yugi 
Yami Yugi draws " Card of Sanctity " and subsequently activates it to make both players  draw  until they hold six cards (Yami Yugi and Noah both draw six cards each). Yami Yugi then activates " Monster Reborn " to revive Seto's " Blue-Eyes White Dragon " (3000/2500) in Attack Position (as this Duel is a continuation of the Duel between Seto and Noah). He then " Polymerization " to fuse "Blue-Eyes White Dragon" with two other "Blue-Eyes White Dragons" in his hand and Fusion Summon " Blue-Eyes Ultimate Dragon " (4500/3800) in Attack Position. 
 Yami Yugi then activates " Quick Attack " to allow "Blue-Eyes Ultimate Dragon" to attack the turn it was summoned (NOTE: Not necessary in the real game, but this Duel uses  Battle City Rules ). "Blue-Eyes Ultimate Dragon" attacks and destroys "Hino-Kagu-Tsuchi" (Noah 10000 → 8300). Yami Yugi then " De-Fusion " to return "Blue-Eyes Ultimate Dragon" to the  Fusion Deck  and revive all three "Blue-Eyes White Dragons" (3000/2500 each) in Attack Position. All three "Blue-Eyes White Dragons" attack directly.
 Turn 41: Yami Yugi 
 Yami Yugi  has just attacked directly with his three " Blue-Eyes White Dragons " ( Noah  8300 → 5300 → 2300 → 0).
 Yami Yugi wins.
