 Biography 
 Mrs. Andrews is  Nelson 's manager, as well as an actress on his show, playing  Galaxy Queen . She first appeared when her son was talking to  Yuma Tsukumo , and forced Yuma out, as Nelson should concentrate on his role as Sparrow. She was shown to be quite cold and wanted her son to completely focus on his career. [1] 
 
       Mrs. Andrews as  Galaxy Queen .     
 That evening, Number 83, when found by Nelson, designed itself to look like Galaxy Queen from the show, becoming  Number 83: Galaxy Queen . Using its powers, the " Number " card made him believe it was his mother. [1] 
 During the Duel between Yuma and Nelson, she was brought there by  Tori Meadows , and saw what had happened to her son. After the Duel, they reconciled, and she promised to let him be himself more instead of forcing him into his role. [2]
