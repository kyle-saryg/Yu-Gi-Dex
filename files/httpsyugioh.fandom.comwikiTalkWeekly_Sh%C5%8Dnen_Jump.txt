 Gallery 
 We've got a ton of images of various issue covers in our unused files. Perhaps we can make a gallery here? -- Golden Key  ( talk  •  contribs ) 19:50, January 9, 2013 (UTC)
 
 Yeah, you can thank me for those. =) A gallery would parallel what the  One Piece wiki  does (or did, at least; now they've got some table/slider combo going on).  「 ディノ 奴 千？！ 」 ?  ·  ☎ Dinoguy1000  23:12, January 9, 2013 (UTC) 
 Well then, thank you. =) 
 Ugh, sliders. Based on conversations I've seen around the site, the majority of people don't like them, and for so many images it would be terribly inconvenient. I'd just go with the gallery. -- Golden Key  ( talk  •  contribs ) 23:26, January 9, 2013 (UTC) 
 Not to mention they (still) don't work properly in Monobook - the sliding/image loading has been fixed (finally), but none of the links seem to.  「 ディノ 奴 千？！ 」 ?  ·  ☎ Dinoguy1000  23:33, January 9, 2013 (UTC)
