 In between  episode 100  and  episode 101 ,  Breo  made  Yusei Fudo  send this card from the top of his Deck to the Graveyard at an unspecified point during their Turbo Duel against each other. 
 In  episode 102 , Yusei uses this card during his Turbo Duel against  Jean . He banishes this card from his Graveyard to switch " Dragon Knight Draco-Equiste " to Attack Position after Jean used " Barrier Wave " to switch Yusei's monsters to Defense Position and inflict damage to Yusei equal to the DEF of " Rapid Warrior " (the  Continuous Effect  of "Dragon Knight Draco-Equiste" wasn't active at that point due to "Dragon Knight Draco-Equiste" being in Defense Position).
