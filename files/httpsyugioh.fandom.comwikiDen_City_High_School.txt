 Den City High School  is a location in the  Yu-Gi-Oh! VRAINS  anime. It is a high school for students who reside in  Den City , equipped with facilities similar to that of a university. The school appears to focus on education rather than Dueling, and teaches a curriculum that includes advanced mathematics and quantum mechanics. The students are often seen carrying an electronic notepad which they often use during their class hours. Teachers also use these notepads to give lectures.
 The classrooms resemble lecture halls and are equipped with an electronic whiteboard that can additionally be connected to a student's  Duel Disk , allowing them to access videos of  LINK VRAINS .
 Cameras are also hinted to be present on the ceilings of the classroom, as one of such was used to spy on  Yusaku Fujiki  when he was conversing with  Naoki Shima .
 As stated by Naoki to Yusaku, no student is allowed to have part time jobs.

 Uniform 
 The standard uniform consists of a slate-colored jacket with light blue trim over a white dress shirt with a blue tie. The boys wear black pants and most of them keep their collars unbuttoned, while the girls wear a black jacket over a light yellow jumper and a black miniskirt and stockings, exposing most of their legs (in the dub, the stockings are changed into leggings, covering their legs entirely). Some opt to wear a pink heart-shaped clip on their ties.
