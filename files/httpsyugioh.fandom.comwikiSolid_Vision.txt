        " Hitotsu-Me Giant ", rendered with Solid Vision     
 Solid Vision  are interactive holographic projections.  Seto Kaiba  used this phenomenon to create holographic monsters in order to recreate the Experience of Death  Penalty Game  and enhance games, including  Duel Monsters ,  Dungeon Dice Monsters  and  Capsule Monster Chess .
 Duel Monsters  cards contain  microchips . When the cards are played in a  Battle Box ,  Dueling Arena ,  Duel Disk  or  Duel Runner , the microchip is activated. The data it contains is used to created the Solid Vision holograms. [1]  There are also certain situations where the holograms can inflict real damage.

 Usage 
 In the manga and Toei anime, Kaiba created Battle Boxes which used Solid Vision to enhance  Duel Monsters  and made a deal with  Industrial Illusions  to produce them.
 During  Death-T , Kaiba used  Battle Boxes , to create holograms of the monsters Summoned in  Duel Monsters  and  Capsule Monster Chess . Whoever lost a game, would be subject to the Illusion of Death by virtual reality. He tested the Penalty Game on human subjects, finding that the average person went insane after ten minutes of the torture.
 Battle Boxes were used exclusively for the original manga version of the  Duelist Kingdom  tournament.
 In the 2000's anime,  Dueling Arenas  were used instead of Battle Boxes and Death-T did not happen.
 To combat  Pegasus'  mind reading, Kaiba used Solid Vision to create  Duel Disks  to play  Duel Monsters  with. These have been primarily used to play  Duel Monsters  in the series starting with Battle City.
 In  Yu-Gi-Oh! 5D's , Solid Vision is also used to play  Duel Monsters  on  Duel Runners .
 In  Yu-Gi-Oh! ZEXAL , a new system of Solid Vision, called  AR Vision  is used with  D-Gazer . The Duel Disks also have a new model called a  D-Pad . This makes it so that the Duel can only be seen by a person if they wear the D-Gazer.
 In  Yu-Gi-Oh! ARC-V , solid vision has now been developed into solid vision with mass by a collaboration between  Leo Akaba  and  Yusho Sakaki . The former founded the  Leo Corporation  to mass produce real solid vision for the general public, leading to the creation of  Action Duels . Real Solid Vision is widely used by  Duel Academy ,  The Resistance  and  Sector Security . The solid vision system is renamed the  ARC (Augmented Reality Combat) System  in the dub.
 According to  Leo Akaba , Real Solid Vision was discovered in the  Original Dimension  and it lead that Dimension's ruin. Monsters produced with Real Solid Vision become self-aware, as Monsters have souls. This caused  a duelist  and  his four dragons  to go in a rampage and merge  into a single celestial dragon .
 In  Yu-Gi-Oh! The Dark Side of Dimensions , the new Duel Disk, developed by  Kaiba Corporation , creates Solid Vision holograms from images in the user's brain.

 Trivia 
 Kazuki Takahashi  explained in an interview in  Duel Art  that Solid Vision was inspired by the holographic Dejarik board from  Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope . [2] 
 Pre-Arc V (which has an explanation) fans often questioned how the holograms were able to cause explosive force during Duels that lacked magic.
