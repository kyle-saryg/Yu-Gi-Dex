 Biography 
 Bashford had a strong relationship with  Adam , who he would often  Duel  and gave him " Kid Junk ".
 Due to his obsession with his work, his wife left him and took custody of Adam. Bashford became a hermit afterwards. He allowed the amount of scrap-iron in the garden to go out of control and did not see his wife or son after their separation. He built an old-fashioned  Duel Arena  in the hopes that Adam would return to Duel him.
 Martha  and  Schmidt  became concerned over Bashford's safety, as he is living alone amongst unstable piles of scrap metal. Unable to convince him to move into Martha's place, they send  Crow  to speak with him.
 After Crow,  Yusei ,  Jack  and  Blister  arrive outside Bashford's property, he attempts to shoo them away. Crow tries to forcefully enter his house, but Bashford fends him away with a series of traps (One of those traps looks like " Scrap-Iron Scarecrow ") and a holographic " Two-Headed King Rex " from the Dueling Arena. 
 Crow challenges him to a Duel in the arena. If Bashford wins, Crow will leave and if Crow wins, Bashford will come with them to Martha's. Bashford reluctantly accepts. He uses a scrap metal family themed  Deck ; Both Yusei and Jack recognize the strategy, but are confused as to why he does not  Summon  the  child card . 
 Because he didn't, he is defeated. The shockwaves from the Duel causes the mountains of junk to fall over, destroying his house. Crow manages to save Bashford, by pulling him into a cabinet to shield them both.
 Before the house collapses, Yusei manages to retrieve a picture of Bashford and his family. Yusei guesses that the reason Bashford did not Summon " Kid Junk " is because he gave it to his  son . 
 Bashford tells them of how he lost contact with Adam due to his own neglect. Yusei, Jack, Blister and Crow tell him that they are his  sons  and convince him to come to Martha's where he will have plenty of grandchildren.
 Bashford moves in to Martha's, where he makes a  Stardust Dragon statue  out of scrap metal in front of the house. He asks Crow to give him a shoulder massage as his new son.

 Bashford uses a  Scrap-Iron Family Deck  that revolves the use cards with the word " Junk " in their name. This, in combination with the  Field Spell  " Junk Factory ", which besides powering them up, also makes  monsters   return  to the owner's  Deck  instead of being  sent  to the  Graveyard  when they are  destroyed . Additionally, his  Trap Cards , much like " Scrap-Iron Scarecrow " are capable of being reused each  turn , having the  effect  to  Set  themselves  face-down  instead of going to the  Graveyard .
