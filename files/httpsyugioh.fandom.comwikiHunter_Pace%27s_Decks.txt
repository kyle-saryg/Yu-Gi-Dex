 Hunter  uses a  Skull of Fire Deck [1]  focusing on the " Burning Skull "  series . His Deck later comes to be known as the  Super Revenge Deck [2]  primarily focused on his " Skull Flame " and recycling his " Burning Skull Heads " to inflict a large amount of  effect damage . During the  Fortune Cup , he uses a  Speed Acceleration Deck , [3]  which focuses on a strategy devoted more toward accumulating a large amount of  Speed Counters  through cards such as " Acceleration Zone " and " Doom Acceleraetor " which gives him early access to more powerful  Speed Spell Cards  such as " Speed Spell - Accelerate Draw " and " Speed Spell - End of the Storm ". He also uses " Speed King Skull Flame " as a contingency.
