        Yusei Fudo's criminal mark.     
 A  criminal mark  is a special variety of facial tattoo given to criminals who have committed crimes in  New Domino City  or to fugitives in the  Yu-Gi-Oh! 5D's  series and in the  New Domino City  of the  Synchro Dimension  in  Yu-Gi-Oh! ARC-V .
 Usually, people with these marks are sentenced to live in  Satellite  to serve their time working in the factories. If they have broken stricter laws (such as trespassing into New Domino City without authorization), they are sent to the Facility. These marks serve various purposes, like identification of people with criminal records or tracking fugitives down in case they escape or commit further crimes.

 Branding criminals 
         The device used to mark criminals.     
 Criminal marks are placed on the offender using a laser that carves a unique shape on the offender's face. (The process stings at most, as Yusei is notably showing shock instead of pain)  In the dub, the carving is replaced with a tattoo of radiophilic dye that creates a specific pattern unique to each criminal and cannot be removed. Additional criminal marks may be put on a criminal's face if that criminal commits repeated crimes.
 
 Tracking people with markings 
         A Security tracker.     
 Security trackers are used to find the location of a marked criminal by tracing the signal emitted by the mark. An individual criminal can be tracked due to the unique pattern of the tattoo. The criminal appears as a dot on a map.
 The signal is known to be easy to jam as  Yusei Fudo  and  Blister  have been able to almost effortlessly jam criminal marks using a laptop or a small handheld device.
 
 Social attitudes 
 People with criminal marks are treated negatively (Very much like the social stigma regarding tattoo's in Japan today) by residents of New Domino City (In the dub,  Luna  said that her father once fired a pool cleaner simply because the pool cleaner had a criminal mark; it is implied that this sort of discrimination is normal in New Domino City, and that Luna's disapproval of it is considered a minority opinion.  Leo  was apprehensive to assist Yusei at first because of his status as a (former) criminal). During Yusei's first  Fortune Cup  match, the crowd was initially against him when it was shown that he had a criminal mark; it was only Yusei's dueling ability that enabled him to gain the crowd's approval. After the defeat of the Dark Signers, it appears that this discrimination has lessened.

 Trivia 
 Most of the residents of Satellite and  Satisfaction Town  have criminal marks. 
 In  Yu-Gi-Oh! 5D's World Championship 2009: Stardust Accelerator , when the player gets captured by Sector Security he/she is given a criminal mark. 
 After being revived by the destruction of " Earthbound Immortal Ccarayhua ",  Sayer  possibly received a criminal mark after he was arrested by  Sector Security  and sent to the  Facility , according to the  Yu-Gi-Oh! 10th Anniversary Animation Book . 
 Criminal marks appear in the manga, though their origins are never commented on, nor are people who bear them discriminated against. (Possibly they're just tattoos. Or the writer forgot to write in a reason for them earlier in the story.) 
 It's possible that some with criminal marks may have attempted to "remove" them by carving off the part of their skin that the mark was on. Though a gruesome idea, if the mark was small and somewhere not near the eyes, it would be possible therefore eliminating the mark at the cost of self-maiming. Or at the very least, get some surgery to change their face in the underground if they had the connections; since plastic surgery would completely restructure or remove the original skin that was marked.
