The  Rule of 3000 ATK and DEF  is a completely unwritten rule stating that in order for a  monster  to have an  original ATK or DEF  of over 3000, it either must have  negative effects  to limit its playability, or otherwise have special  conditions  for being  Summoned . This rule has never been acknowledged by UDE or KDE. This rule is similar to the " Level 4 ATK and DEF Rules ".

 General Statements About Monsters 
       " Super Conductor Tyranno ", a monster that breaks the rule by having over 3000 original ATK and being Normal Summonable with no  drawback .     
 In general, monsters may be  Normal Summoned  with neither any special conditions nor any negative effects, such as the iconic " Blue-Eyes White Dragon ". Many such monsters even have beneficial effects. However, monsters sometimes either possess negative effects in order to remain Normal Summonable, such as " Arcana Force XXI - The World " (which also happens to have one of the best effects in the game if you win a coin flip) or " Ultimate Obedient Fiend ", or must have Summoning conditions that prevent them from being Normal Summoned.  Extra Deck  monsters do not fall into the latter category as it is an inherent game mechanic, no monsters can be Normal Summoned from the Extra Deck as a monster needs to be in the hand to be Normal Summoned
 " Super Conductor Tyranno ", " Thunder King, the Lightningstrike Kaiju " and " Jizukiru, the Star Destroying Kaiju " are examples of exceptions to this rule. There are currently  216  monsters with over 3000 ATK.
