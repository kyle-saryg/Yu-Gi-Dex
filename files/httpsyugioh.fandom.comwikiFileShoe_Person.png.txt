 The  Junky Scorpion owner  (ジャンキースコーピオンのオーナー  Jankī Sukōpion no Ōnā ) is a character in the  Yu-Gi-Oh!  manga . He is the owner of a store called  Junky Scorpion . He tried to con  Katsuya Jonouchi  out of a pair of shoes he bought.
 
 Biography 
 The owner claimed that someone in America was killed over the shoes he wears. [1] 
 
       The owner tries to kill the scorpion.     
 When  Katsuya Jonouchi  came to his shop to buy a pair of rare  Air Muscle  shoes, the owner refused to sell them, unless Jonouchi could prove he's worthy. The owner pretended to slip  his pet scorpion  into the shoe and told Jonouchi he must put his foot inside before he can buy the shoes. Jonouchi did so and the owner sold him the shoes at half price. Jonouchi traded his old shoes to pay some of the cost. The owner then paid a group of thugs, the  Muscle Hunters , 3000 yen each to mug Jonouchi and his friends and steal back the shoes. [1] 
 After  Yugi Mutou  found out about the owner's con, he changed to  Dark Yugi  and confronted the owner. The owner did not want Yugi to leave the store, knowing his secret, so he hid his scorpion in one of the shoes as he gave it back, hoping to poison Dark Yugi. However Dark Yugi was not fooled and put coins in the shoe to play a  Shadow Game ,  coin in sneaker . [1] 
 In the Shadow Game, the owner and Yugi took turns grabbing coins out of the shoe, trying to avoid being stung by the scorpion. The winner was the player who got the most coins. The owner also added a rule, where if he wins, Dark Yugi must give him 100,000 yen for each coin he gets. The owner stabbed the toe of the shoe with a knife, in an attempt to kill the scorpion and grab all the coins. However, he missed and got his hand stuck in the shoe, allowing the scorpion to sting him. [1] 
 He was taken to the hospital for treatment, while Yugi took the shoes back to Jonouchi. [1]
