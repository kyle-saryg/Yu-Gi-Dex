 Message from Kazuki Takahashi 
 Mr. Yoshida, the "ZEXAL" writer, has helped out on every "Yu-Gi-Oh!" anime series. He's more important to the current "Yu-Gi-Oh!" world than I am, and I created the original! [2] 
 
 Message from Shin Yoshida 
 In this volume, you'll finally get to see Yuma take on the second and third assassins. Enjoy watching all these unique characters duel! [2] 
 
 Message from Naohito Miyoshi 
 This manga's jetting in its own unique story! Things unfold a bit differently than they do in the anime, and at first working on this part made me nervous, but now I'm having fun again! Keep cheering us on! [2]
