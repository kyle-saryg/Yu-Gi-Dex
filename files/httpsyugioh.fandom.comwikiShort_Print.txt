"SP" redirects here. For the  phase , see  Standby Phase .   
 Short Prints  are identical to  Commons , except they are harder to find. The current ratio of finding one in a pack is approximately 1:30. This rarity only exists in the  TCG , although it is essentially the same as the  OCG's   Normal Rare . This rarity was discontinued after  Ancient Sanctuary , but was re-introduced in the TCG in  Phantom Darkness . In the latest booster packs, the cards that are chosen to be Short Printed cards are the same as the ones chosen to be Normal Rares in the OCG.
 The term "Short Print" is also applied by players to cards of other rarities, like Super or Ultra Rares, that appear to be harder to find in booster packs, although there is no evidence that some cards of other rarities are short printed with regard to those of the same rarity.
 According to  a post  by  Kevin Tewart , all  Booster Packs  contain Short Print cards.
 On the Official Card Database, this rarity is unmarked.
 
 Example 
 
 Trivia 
 In older booster packs, several cards are considered to be  Super Short Print , which are also identical in appearance to  Common  cards, but even more difficult to find (as compared to a regular Short Print card). However,  Kevin Tewart  has  stated  that no such rarity exists.
