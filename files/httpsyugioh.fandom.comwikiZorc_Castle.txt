 Events 
 In the setting of the game, the castle once belonged to a king and queen. However  Zorc  assassinated them and turned it into his den of evil and terrorized people of the land with monsters. [2] 
 Yugi  and his friends played  Monster World  as adventurers, who tried to stop Zorc's reign. They received directions to the castle from Villager D, who was played by  Mr. Karita . [2]  By the time they reached the castle, Dark Bakura had sealed the souls of Yugi and his friends in the figures of their characters, while  Dark Yugi  was left to roll for his friends. [1] 
 The adventurers got trapped in the tower with the spiked ceiling about to crush them. However Dark Yugi managed to figure out how to get the middle block and rolled a key number. [1] 
 Since Zorc, who was Dark Bakura's avatar, had lost his left hand earlier, Dark Bakura lost control of his left hand to  Ryo Bakura . Ryo was able to take advantage of this to hinder Dark Bakura's plays. Annoyed by this, Dark Bakura pushed his left hand down on top of one of the castle's towers injuring it so Ryo couldn't use it against him. [3]
