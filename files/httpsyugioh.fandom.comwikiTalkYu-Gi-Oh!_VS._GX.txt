 Ahem, I'm not sure if you read the article, but it was said that the original idea was scrapped, in other words canceled, so this movie will not be produced and released in theaters. -- Qim1  ( talk  •  contribs ) 03:44, July 3, 2011 (UTC) 
 Yes, those ideas are already included in the original "Yu-Gi-Oh! GX" show, and Judai vs. Yuugi duel are already set as last two episodes of GX. So yes, that movie is dead, and never born again. -- F r e d C a t  11:17, July 3, 2011 (UTC)
