 Characteristics 
 Aside from the obligatory alternate folding feature, and a cosmetic refit, this Disk functions identically to the  KC mass production Disk . The shift from standby to active mode of this version of the Duel Disk is much less pronounced than the KC mass production variant, only requiring the top section of the card platform to extend.
 An updated version of the Academia Disk has the color of the user's dorm on it. In season four, the students use these new Duel Disks.
 Unlike previous models, there is no sound effect when cards are placed on the Duel Disk to signify that the Duel Disk recognizes and activates a specific card. However, In  Yu-Gi-Oh! Bonds Beyond Time , there was actually a sound effect when Jaden places a card on his Duel Disk.

 History 
         Alexis Rhodes  checks what card her  Tag-Team Duel  partner  Bastion Misawa  has  Set .     
 Duel Academy students originally used the  KC mass production Disk , before this one was introduced. [1]  In the final season of  Yu-Gi-Oh! GX , color variations were released. Students got red, yellow or blue disks depending on the color of their dormitory. [2]  Other variations of the Academia Disk exist, such as those used by  Amnael  and  Adrian Gecko . [3] [4]  Duelists in  Yu-Gi-Oh! 5D's  often use  Duel Disks  that resemble the Academia Disk, but they come in different color combinations.

 In the  Yu-Gi-Oh! GX  manga , the Academia Disk is shown to have a further function. The central "gem" functions as a screen that a Duelist can use to check cards  Set  by partners in  Tag-Team Duels [5] , as well as to check cards in the  Graveyard  of their partners and opponents. [6] 
 In the  Yu-Gi-Oh! 5D's  manga , the Academia Disk is shown being used by individuals not related to the Academia, implying that it was a standard replacement for the  Battle City model .
 
 
 Real world 
         Mattel's Academia Duel Disk     
 As with the  KC mass production Disk  and  Chaos Duel Disk , Mattel made replicas of the Academia Disk. They fixed one of the main problems of the Disks by resizing the  Zones  to fit cards with protective sleeves. However, it can only hold 40 cards with sleeves. Many of the other problems remained, including:
 
 No place for  banished  cards and the  Fusion Deck . 
 Straps are one size only. This was a major problem for players who were bulky in the wrist region and used the Academia Disk in order to save space and not use a table or for fans who wished to use the disk as part of a cosplay outfit. 
 The  Life Point  counter is still limited to 9990. 
 Owners of the Academia Disk accounted that between different Academia Disk that there was a variance of 34 - 40 cards held within the Deck Zone. 
 This Duel Disk is the first one that is identical to its anime counterpart. Although the main flaw with the Duel Disk was addressed in the new Academia Disk, many of the major flaws still remained unaddressable. Although the Duel Disks are perceived as "toys", few use the Academia Disk in place of taking up space on a table. Along with the release of the Academia, Mattel produced a specialized carrying pack for the new disks, although none have been used or seen in stores. Due to past sales of the Academia Disk and the limited popularity with the toy as a dueling medium, Mattel discontinued the production of the Academia Disk several months after its release.
 
         The Japanese Slifer Red Academia Disk.     
 A  Slifer Red  Academia Disk was released in Japan in November 23, 2007, retailing at ¥5985 (¥5700 excluding tax). [7]  Also included with the product were 100  card sleeves , a card case, three  Booster Packs :  Tactical Evolution ,  Gladiator's Assault  and  Phantom Darkness  and five  promotional cards :  " Elemental Hero Prisma ", " Card Ejector ", " Hidden Armory ", " Assault Armor " and " Evil Blast ".
