Jaden Yuki 's Deck  has evolved greatly within both the anime and  manga  versions of  Yu-Gi-Oh! GX . His Deck mostly contains " Elemental Hero " monsters, and his strategies normally focus of  Fusion Summoning  his weaker monsters for stronger ones with various effects.
 In Season 2, he gains a card called " Elemental Hero Neos " (which becomes his  signature card ), a card of his own design. This card is known for  Contact Fusions  with the " Neo-Spacian " monsters. He reveals that this kind of  Special Summoning  can be used without a " Polymerization " card.
 While his manga incarnation still uses "Elemental Hero" monsters, he does not generally use the same ones that his anime counterpart utilizes. He later begins using the " Masked Hero " monsters in place of them.
 So far, he has been featured in more Duels than any other character in the franchise.

 During the  Seven Stars  arc , Jaden plays an  " Elemental Hero " Deck , composed of  Spell  and  Trap Cards  that  support  them, as well as his spirit partner " Winged Kuriboh ". His  Deck  largely supports  Fusion Summoning  stronger "Elemental Hero" monsters, often using a colorful array of Spell Cards, which have additional effects besides the aforementioned effect, allowing great flexibility in strategies. All "Elemental Hero" monsters fuse in some combination, granting Jaden a myriad of different effects to take advantage of.

 After his second  Duel  with  Aster , Jaden's  Deck  is left blank to his eyes due to  Sartorius ' powers. With the inability to use his old Deck, Jaden received a new one that included  the cards he created as a child  for a  KaibaCorp  contest. Once his ability to see his older cards returned, he combined elements from both Decks into a single Deck, his  " Neos " Deck . While this Deck still contains many of the cards from his original Deck, it also consists of  " Neo-Spacians "  and cards that exploit their ability to " Contact Fuse " with " Elemental Hero Neos " in a  Guyver -inspired fashion. "Neos" becomes his signature card after he acquires it, much like " Dark Magician " was for  Yugi Muto .

 Jaden continues to use his  "Neos" Deck  in the  Dimension World  arc, debuting more advanced tactics regarding the "Neo-Spacian" monsters. This includes  Triple Contact Fusions , which involve "Elemental Hero Neos" and two "Neo-Spacian" monsters, rather than one, and increased usage of the " Chrysalis " monsters. After being freed from the influence of  The Supreme King , Jaden keeps the " Super Polymerization " card, which proved to be one of the keys of ending his continued conflict with  Yubel .

 While possessed by  The Supreme King , Jaden plays an  " Evil Hero " Deck , which consists of vile incarnations of his regular " Elemental Hero " Fusions. As opposed to his flexible strategies that he normally uses, this Deck consists of a much more straightforward approach that simply overpowers his opponents with the deadly effects of certain "Evil Heroes", as his trademark card, " Dark Fusion ", protects the  Summoned   monsters  from being destroyed by Spell and Trap Cards.

 In the  Darkness  arc, Jaden begins using a variety of cards he used from the previous seasons, especially from Season 1. The most noticeable change in his Deck is the new usage of " Super Polymerization " and " Yubel " herself. He's able to use the former to fuse the latter with " Elemental Hero Neos " to create " Neos Wiseman ".
