 Summary 
         " Skypalace Gangaridai " attacks Yuma directly.     
 Ray  points out that  Yuma  does not have enough  Life Points  to survive the  attack  from " Skypalace Gangaridai ".  Tori  and  Cathy  agree as  Mayday  commands "Gangaridai" to fire its cannons. Yuma is worried about the attack and is having a hard time deciding what to do with his card " Half Unbreak ". But  Astral  tells him that there is a way to survive. As "Gangaridai" attacks Yuma, he figures it out and activates "Half Unbreak". Mayday wonders why Yuma would activate that as he has no  monsters  on his field. Yuma explains that he doesn't have to the use card on his monsters, but he can use it on his opponent's monsters also. He targets "Gangaridai" and Yuma takes half the  Battle Damage  as his  Life Points  fall to 1900. 
 Mayday is impressed by Yuma's play, commenting that "Half Unbreak" normally protects a monster from being  destroyed by battle , but it reduces the damage done to Yuma's Life Points; he also adds that Yuma used it while he didn't have any monsters on his side of the field (in the dub, Mayday also tells  Anna  that she's lucky to have a quick-thinking partner like Yuma, and that there aren't many Duelists who can come up with impressive maneuvers).  Brooke  agrees with Mayday's observation and adds that this was why Yuma targeted "Gangaridai" with "Half Unbreak". Mayday decides to  Set  a card to end his  turn .
 
         " Gauntlet Launcher " is Summoned.     
 Yuma's turn is next. He  Normal Summons  " Dododo Warrior " without  Tribute  by reducing its  ATK  by 500. He activates " Xyz Reception ". Since Mayday  controls  an  Xyz Monster  while Yuma doesn't, Yuma Special Summons a monster with the same Level as "Dododo Warrior"; he Special Summons " Chachaka Archer ". Yuma overlays his two  Level  6 monsters to  Xyz Summon  " Gauntlet Launcher . Anna is disappointed that Yuma Summoned a  Rank  6 monster when she already has a Rank 10 monster in " Superdreadnought Rail Cannon Gustav Max ". Yuma points out that "Gustav Max" was destroyed in the last turn (in the dub, Anna is frustrated that Yuma's move didn't do her any good, and tells Yuma that the next time they Dueled together, she should build Yuma's Deck. Yuma retorts that Anna thinks she's better than him, but Anna retaliates that she  knows  she's better than him). Brooke angrily calls out to Yuma and Anna to stop bickering and get on with it (Brooke did not say anything at this point in the dub; instead, Yuma says that he'll prove Anna wrong). Astral tells Yuma that this isn't the time for pointless bickering (this is cut from the dub). 
 Yuma continues his turn by activating " Xyz Treasure ",  drawing a card  for each Xyz Monster on the field; he draws two cards since there are two Xyz Monsters. He  activates  the effect of "Gauntlet Launcher",  detaching  an  Overlay Unit  to destroy a monster on the field. Ray says that Yuma can take down "Gangaridai" this way. Yuma targets "Gangaridai" for the effect of "Gauntlet Launcher", but Brooke counters with her  face-down  " Xyz Coat ", preventing "Gangaridai" from being destroyed by battle or card effects this turn. "Gangaridai" is surrounded by a hexagonal barrier as the rocket fist launched by "Gauntlet Launcher" explodes harmlessly. Yuma is frustrated that his effect was blocked, but adds that this can't stop him from attacking. He declares a direct attack on Brooke with "Gauntlet Launcher", (in the dub, Yuma erroneously declares the attack on Mayday) but Mayday activates " Xyz Move " to give control of "Gangaridai" to Brooke and end the  Battle Phase . "Gangaridai" disappears from Mayday's side and reappears on Brooke's. Yuma is once again frustrated that his play got countered. Brooke remarks that Mayday saved her, affectionately calling him "darling". Mayday responds that it's his role to protect her. Tori and Cathy excitedly comment that this relationship is lovely (these scenes are cut from the dub). Astral says that Brooke's and Mayday's superb teamwork will make them difficult to defeat. Yuma Sets a card to end his turn, but Anna yells at him to wait, wanting to take over to get the Duel back on track. 
 
         Yuma  and  Anna  arguing about their tactics.     
 Anna activates her face-down " Upgrade ", Tributing "Gauntlet Launcher" to Special Summon "Gustav Max" from her Graveyard and give it 600  more  ATK . With that, Anna boasts that "Gustav Max" has more ATK than "Gangaridai" and adds that "Gustav Max" can't be destroyed by card effects (Anna does not mention the last effect of "Upgrade" in the dub; she instead tells Yuma that there's no need to shower her with compliments; there will be plenty of time for that after the Duel). Once again, Yuma is angry at Anna for using his own monsters without asking him beforehand. Anna counters that Yuma couldn't have beaten "Gangaridai" with "Gauntlet Launcher" by himself, but Yuma yells that he had tactics in mind (in the original, Yuma struggles to say tactics, but Astral corrects him; in the dub, he says "strategy" without difficulty). Anna chides Yuma, since he couldn't have survived like that. She tells Yuma to stop whining and leave it to her. Yuma yells that he can't trust Anna because of this (in the dub, the argument is changed slightly, and Yuma asks why Anna teamed up with him; she replies that the tournament rules said so).
 Brooke watches Yuma's and Anna's argument. She thinks to herself that Anna doesn't understand that by clashing all her feelings together in a Duel, can one heart meet another head-on. Brooke remembers that she Dueled many times alongside Mayday. She also remembers teaching Anna how to Duel, defeating her with " Mermail Abysstrite " in one instance. Brooke taught Anna how to Duel in the first place because she thought it would allow them to connect their hearts. Brooke also recalls that she gave up " Devoted Love " for Anna during her wedding with Mayday, hoping that Anna would find a knight of her and play a Tag Duel not just literally, but in life. (Brooke's thoughts and the flashbacks are cut from the dub). Back at the Duel, Yuma finally ends his turn and passes it to Brooke. 
 
           Brooke 's mind is drawn into the  Barian Emblem .     
 Brooke's turn comes and she draws. She looks at the card she just drew and recognizes it as " Rank-Up-Magic Barian's Force ". It glows with a red energy, and in her mind, Brooke is drawn into the  Barian Emblem . She recalls the observations she made about Yuma's and Anna's argument (in the dub,  the Barian 's words of Brooke falling under his control from the previous episode are heard instead). Back at the Duel, Brooke opens her eyes and says that she'll make Anna understand (in the dub, she says that she will unleash her full power) and activates "Barian's Force". Yuma and Astral recognize the card, with the latter adding that Brooke is now under the Barians' control. Ray, Tori and Cathy are surprised by this. Astral warns Yuma that they must win the Duel. Mayday asks Brooke about when she added "Barian's Force" in her Deck and why she had a strange-looking emblem on her forehead. Brooke explains the effect of "Barian's Force" (in the dub, Brooke says that all will be clear when she and Mayday win). She overlays "Gangaridai" and performs a  Chaos Xyz Evolution  to Special Summon " CXyz Skypalace Babylon ". 
 
           "Gustav Max" is destroyed.     
 Mayday and Anna are shocked, as Brooke never Summoned that monster before. Brooke activates the effect of "Babylon", detaching a Chaos Overlay Unit to let it attack twice this turn. The Chaos Overlay Unit flies into the cannon of "Babylon" as Brooke declares " Double Destruction ". Astral points out that Anna has 2000 Life Points left, adding that "Babylon" will destroy "Gustav Max" with the first attack, then finish off Anna with a direct attack. Brooke tells Anna to prepare herself and attacks "Gustav Max" with "Babylon". "Babylon" gathers energy into its cannon, preparing to fire at Anna, with Brooke declaring " Destiny Demolisher ".Yuma activates his face-down " Reverse Glasses " to halve the ATK of all face-up monsters on the field until the End Phase. The glasses leap up from the card and fire a burst of blue energy at "Babylon", reducing its ATK by half; the ATK of "Gustav Max" is halved as well. The attack continues, destroying "Gustav Max" and Anna's Life Points falling to 1900. Anna asks Yuma why he saved her. Yuma responds that it's because they're partners, and it's natural for them to protect each other. Brooke angrily says that Yuma did something very annoying (in the dub, she says that his effort to protect Anna was wasted). She activates the effect of "Babylon", inflicting damage equal to half of the ATK of "Gustav Max" on the field to Anna, 900 in total. Brooke declares " Secondary Disaster " and "Babylon" fires its cannon again, dropping Anna's Life Points to 1000. 
 Brooke says that it isn't over yet, and "Babylon" can attack again (in the dub, Brooke congratulates Anna and Yuma for putting up a good fight, but she's done taking it easy on them). She attacks Anna directly, but Yuma saves her by Special Summoning " Gentlemander " from his hand via its own effect to intercept the attack. "Gentlemander" floats down to the field with its umbrella and folds it back. Yuma explains that only "Gentlemander" can be attacked now. "Gentlemander" pours tea into a cup and sips it. A replay occurs and "Babylon" attacks and destroys "Gentlemander", dropping Yuma to 700 Life Points. Brooke comments that it's touching that Yuma would act as a shield for Anna (in the dub, she adds that it would lead to his downfall). She activates the secondary effect of "Babylon" again, inflicting damage to Yuma equal to half of the ATK of "Gentlemander". Brooke declares "Secondary Disaster" again, as Yuma is knocked back and left with 100 Life Points. Anna yells Yuma's name (this is cut from the dub). Brooke Sets a card to end her turn, also pointing out that the effect of "Reverse Glasses" wears off at this point.
 Anna begins her turn and draws. She looks at the card she drew and realizes it was "Devoted Love", the card that she received from Brooke. She closes her eyes for a brief moment, then refocuses on the Duel. Anna Normal Summons " Ruffian Railcar " and declares a direct attack on Mayday with it. "Railcar" charges towards Mayday, but Brooke activates her face-down "Xyz Move" to give control of "Babylon" to Mayday and end the Battle Phase. "Babylon" moves to Mayday's side of the field. Astral notes that even though Brooke is under Barian control, she still manages to work well with Mayday. Anna continues by activating the effect of "Railcar" to inflict 500 damage to Brooke. She declares " Train Rain " as "Railcar" fires two beams of light from its headlights at Brooke, reducing her Life Points to 2500. Brooke rises and calls the Duel a useless struggle. She compares the struggle to "pouring water on a hot stone" and tells Anna to look at Yuma. She continues on, adding that Yuma could fall over at any second because he gave up most of his hand trying to save her and he had no defensive monsters with him. Brooke concludes that Yuma and Anna will fall cruelly to the formation of love (in the dub, Brooke calls Anna persistent and adds that Anna is completely focused on herself and has forgotten that she's part of a team. She reminds Anna that she has a partner in Yuma, and she's about to lose him due to Yuma giving up most of his Life Points, leaving him defenseless. On the next turn, Brooke and Mayday will eliminate Yuma, then focus their anger on Anna). Mayday is shocked at Brooke's words and reminds her that this Duel is for fun. Brooke snaps at her husband, telling him to stay out of it. Anna thinks Yuma's name (in the dub, Anna realizes that Brooke was right, and she must help Yuma). After a brief moment of hesitation, she Sets a card and ends her turn.
 
           Anna explains the effect of " Devoted Love ".     
 Mayday's turn begins. After he draws, Brooke yells at Mayday to show Yuma and Anna the power of their love. Unnerved at his wife's attitude, Mayday reluctantly agrees. He activates the effect of "Babylon", detaching a Chaos Overlay Unit to let it attack twice this turn. Mayday declares a direct attack on Yuma. Ray exclaims that if the attack hits, Yuma is finished (this scene is cut from the dub). Anna watches Yuma, hesitant on what to do. Then she recalls a memory about Brooke telling her about "Devoted Love"; Anna may not understand it right now, but she will get it someday. Back at the Duel, Anna now has the answer. She activates her face-down "Devoted Love". Tori and Cathy are shocked at the card's activation. 
 
           Anna's Life Points drop to 0.      He draws " Rank-Up-Magic Limited Barian's Force ".
 Anna explains that she can reduce the damage from the attack of "Babylon" to 0 and let her opponent draw a card, but her Life Points will become 0 at the End Phase. Anna chooses to let Yuma draw the card (in the dub, Anna also encourages Yuma to defeat the Walkers). Yuma is surprised that Anna saved him. Astral says Yuma's name. Now knowing what to do, Yuma yells " kattobingu " and draws a card per the effect of "Devoted Love". Anna comments that Yuma drew a good card (in the dub, Anna voices her faith in Yuma to win the Duel). Brooke is visibly shocked. Mayday ends his turn (in the dub, Mayday also asks Yuma to prove Anna right). At the End Phase, the "Devoted Love" card rises out of a Graveyard portal. It hits Anna with a burst of pink energy, reducing her Life Points to 0. Yuma yells Anna's name. Anna says that she'll leave the rest to Yuma. Yuma thanks Anna. 
 
           Astral  warning Yuma not to use the "Barian" card.     
 Astral asks Yuma about the card he just drew.He asks if the card is a Barian card. Remembering to keep his promise to Ray, Yuma hesitates before claiming that he took the card from  Girag  (in the dub, Yuma simply says he found it after Girag's defeat). Astral asks Yuma why he put the card in his Deck. Yuma hesitates again, but tells Astral to focus on the Duel for now (in the dub, he tells Astral that he can explain after they win the Duel). Yuma starts his turn and Normal Summons " Gagaga Magician ". Yuma glances over to Anna and says that he won't let Anna's monster go to waste (this is cut from the dub). He overlays his "Gagaga Magician" and Anna's "Railcar" to Xyz Summon " Number 39: Utopia ". Yuma thinks to himself that "Utopia" only has 2500 ATK and that it can't take down "Babylon" without support (in the dub, he also asks himself if he should risk using "Limited Barian's Force"). He holds on to "Limited Barian's Force" with both hands, unsure on what to do. Astral warns Yuma about using the card, as it could be dangerous. Yuma says that he has no choice but use it, even if it's a Barian's card. (in the dub, Yuma says if they lose, they'll lose everything). Ignoring Astral's warning, Yuma activates "Limited Barian's Force", overlaying "Utopia" and performing a Chaos Xyz Evolution to Special Summon " Number C39: Utopia Ray V ". 
 
           "Babylon" is destroyed.     
 Astral comments that this is the evolved form of "Utopia" (in the dub, he hopes that Yuma will not regret this choice). Tori and Cathy are surprised at "Utopia Ray V", while Ray smiles in satisfaction. Brooke says that Yuma's effort has gone to waste, adding that "Utopia Ray V" is still weaker than "Babylon". Yuma smiles and says, "We'll see about that." He activates the effect of "Utopia Ray V", detaching a Chaos Overlay Unit to destroy a monster on the field and inflict damage to his opponent equal to that monster's ATK. Yuma declares " Spinning Blades of Destruction " and "Utopia Ray V" unsheathes its swords and throws them towards "Babylon". Several explosions set off within "Babylon", destroying it. Mayday is thrown back, as his Life Points fall to 0. Yuma attacks Brooke directly with "Utopia Ray V", declaring " Rising Sun Star Slash ". The swords of "Utopia Ray V" glow purple, and "Utopia Ray V" slashes them in a V fashion. The V pattern comes at Brooke and she is knocked back, her Life Points falling to 0. Mayday runs toward Brooke and succeeds in catching her. The Barian Emblem disappears from her forehead.
 Yuma, Tori and Cathy cheer over the victory. The girls shake hands with each other, but immediately turn away in disgust. Ray simply stands next to them, smiling. Yuma turns to Ray, who nods in approval. Mayday helps Brooke to her feet and asks if she's alright. She confirms that she's okay. Mayday asks Brooke what's the matter because it's rare to see her so fired up (in the dub, Mayday says that Brooke Dueled like a different person). Brooke apologizes to Mayday, saying that during the Duel, she felt her head heat up. Then she remembers that she Dueled brutally against Anna (in the dub, Brooke did not remember what she did after the time she drew "Barian's Force"). Anna runs up to Yuma and slaps him in the back. She congratulates him on winning the Duel. Yuma thanks her, rubbing his back.
 At sunset, Yuma and Ray are chatting with Mayday, while Brooke tells Anna that she isn't really quitting Dueling, but taking a break from it. Anna asks why, and Brooke rubs her stomach, telling her that it's because of the proof of her and Mayday's love. Anna realizes that Brooke must be pregnant and that she didn't know anything about that (the scene where Brooke rubs her stomach is cut from the dub; instead, Brooke decided to take a break from Dueling because of her love for teaching. After this, Anna apologizes for not knowing about this sooner, and that she was angry at Brooke for nothing). Brooke places a hand on Anna's shoulder and apologizes to Anna because she wasn't trying to hide it from her (in the dub, Brooke was about to explain this to Anna, but there wasn't enough time), and thanks to that, she enjoyed a Duel with her and Yuma (in the dub, Brookes says that she's also open to her and Mayday having a friendly rematch with Yuma and Anna). Anna agrees. 
 
           Anna and Yuma falling down.     
 Brooke says that she's glad that Anna finally understands the meaning of "Devoted Love" (this is cut from the dub). Anna blushes and Brooke turns her towards Yuma, telling her to "direct attack him with your love" (in the dub, Brooke tells Anna to tell Yuma about the rematch). She pushes Anna towards Yuma, causing them to fall down a flight of stairs, with everyone but Brooke looking on in surprise. Later on during the night when Yuma is sleeping, Astral is inside his  key . He recalls that Yuma used "Limited Barian's Force" to give "Utopia" a stronger form during the Duel against Brooke and Mayday. He muses that it could be a powerful asset, but he believes that playing it was a mistake.
 
 Featured Duel: Yuma Tsukumo & Anna Kaboom vs. Brooke and Mayday Walker 
 Duel continues from  the previous episode . 
 Turn 5: Mayday  
" Skypalace Gangaridai " has just attacked  Yuma  directly, but Yuma  activates  his  face-down  " Half Unbreak " to  target  "Skypalace Gangaridai" and halve the  Battle Damage  he takes (Yuma: 3100 → 1400 LP).  Mayday   Sets  a card ("Xyz Move").
 Turn 6: Yuma  
Yuma draws. He then  Normal Summons  " Dododo Warrior " in Attack Position without  Tribute  via its own  effect  by reducing its  ATK  by 500 ( 6/2300 → 1800/900). As his opponent  controls  an  Xyz Monster  and he does not, Yuma  activates  " Xyz Reception " to target "Dododo Warrior" and  Special Summon  " Chachaka Archer " (who has the same Level as "Dododo Warrior") in Attack Position with its ATK and DEF 0 and its effects negated ( 6/1200 → 0/1800 → 0). Yuma  overlays  "Dododo Warrior" and "Chachaka Archer" in order to  Xyz Summon  " Gauntlet Launcher " ( 6/2400/2800, ORU: 2) in  Attack Position . Yuma activates " Xyz Treasure " to draw two cards (one for each Xyz Monster on the field).
 Yuma activates the effect of "Gauntlet Launcher" to  detach  an  Overlay Unit  ("Gauntlet Launcher": 2 → 1 ORU) and  destroy  "Skypalace Gangaridai", but Brooke activates her  face-down  " Xyz Coat " to prevent "Skypalace Gangaridai" from being destroyed by battle and card effects this  turn . "Gauntlet Launcher" attacks Brooke  directly , but Mayday activates his face-down " Xyz Move " to give control of "Skypalace Gangaridai" to Brooke and end the  Battle Phase . Yuma Sets a card. Anna activates her face-down " Upgrade " to Tribute "Gauntelet Launcher" (an Xyz Monster) and revive " Superdreadnought Rail Cannon Gustav Max " in Attack Position with its ATK increased by 600 as well as grant "Superdreadnought Rail Cannon Gustav Max" immunity to destruction by card effects ( 10/3000 → 3600/3000).
 Turn 7: Brooke  
 
           " CXyz Skypalace Baylon " is Summoned.     
 Brooke draws " Rank-Up-Magic Barian's Force " and subsequently activates it to  Rank-Up  "Skypalace Gangaridai" via  Chaos Xyz Evolution  in order to Xyz Summon " Chaos Xyz Skypalace Babylon " ( 11/3800/4000, ORU: 2) in Attack Position. Brooke then activates the second effect of "Skypalace Babylon" to detach a Chaos Overlay Unit ("Skypalace Babylon": 2 → 1 ORU) and allow it to attack twice. "Skypalace Babylon" attacks "Superdreadnought Rail Cannon Gustav Max", but Yuma activates his face-down " Reverse Glasses " to halve the ATK of all face-up monsters on the field ("Superdreadnought Rail Cannon Gustav Max": 3600 → 1800 ATK, "Skypalace Babylon": 3800 → 1900 ATK). "Skypalace Babylon" then destroys "Superdreadnought Rail Cannon Gustav Max" (Anna: 2000 → 1900 LP). Brooke activates the first effect of "Skypalace Babylon" to inflict damage to Anna equal to half of her destroyed monster's ATK on the field (Anna: 1900 → 1000 LP).
 
           " Gentlemander " is Summoned.     
 "Skypalace Babylon" attacks Anna directly, but Yuma activates the effect of " Gentlemander " from his hand in order to Special Summon "Gentlemander" ( 4/1200/1000) in Attack Position. Due to the second effect of "Gentlemander", it is the only target for Brooke's attacks. A  replay  occurs and Brooke uses "Skypalace Babylon" to attack and destroy "Gentlemander" (Yuma: 1400 → 700 LP). The first effect of "Skypalace Babylon" activates (Yuma: 700 → 100 LP). Brooke Sets a card. On Brooke's End Phase, the effect of "Reverse Glasses" expires ("Skypalace Babylon": 1900 → 3800 ATK).
 Turn 8: Anna  
 
           " Ruffian Railcar " is Summoned.     
 Anna's hand contains "Ruffian Railcar", " Attraffic Control ", and " Train Connection ". Anna draws " Devoted Love ". She then  Normal Summons  " Ruffian Railcar " ( 4/1800/1000) in Attack Position. "Ruffian Railcar" attacks Mayday directly, but Brooke activates her face-down " Xyz Move " to give control of "Skypalace Babylon" to Mayday and end the Battle Phase. Anna activates the effect of "Ruffian Railcar" to inflict 500 damage and she chooses to inflict the damage to Brooke (Brooke: 3000 → 2500 LP). Anna Sets "Devoted Love".
 Turn 9: Mayday  
Mayday draws. He then activates the effect of "Skypalace Babylon" ("Skypalace Babylon": 1 → 0 ORU) to allow it to attack twice. "Skypalace Babylon" attacks Yuma directly, but Anna activates her face-down "Devoted Love" to end the Battle Phase and allow Yuma to draw a card (Yuma draws " Rank-Up-Magic Limited Barian's Force "). On Mayday's End Phase, the final effect of "Devoted Love" makes Anna's Life Points become 0 (Anna: 1000 → 0 LP), but "Ruffian Railcar" remains on the field.
 Turn 10: Yuma  
Yuma draws. He then Normal Summons " Gagaga Magician " ( 4/1500/1000) in Attack Position. Yuma then overlays "Gagaga Magician" and "Ruffian Railcar" in order to Xyz Summon " Number 39: Utopia " ( 4/2500/2000, ORU: 2) in Attack Position. Yuma activates "Rank-Up-Magic Limited Barian's Force" to Rank-Up "Utopia" via Chaos Xyz Evolution in order to Xyz Summon " Chaos Number 39: Utopia Ray V " ( 5/2600/2000, ORU: 3) in Attack Position. Yuma activates the effect of "Utopia Ray V" to destroy "Skypalace Babylon" and inflict damage to Mayday equal to its ATK by detaching a Chaos Overlay Unit ("Utopia Ray V": 3 → 2 ORU) (Mayday: 3000 → 0 LP). "Utopia Ray V" attacks Brooke directly (Brooke: 2500 → 0 LP).

 Errors 
 When  Yuma  explains the  effect  of " Dododo Warrior ", its  Level  is missing in the card. This is corrected in the dub. 
 When  Brooke  started to use the effect of " CXyz Skypalace Babylon ", she said by  detaching   two   Overlay Units  she can  activate  its effect. However, she only uses one Overlay Unit, not two (the final Overlay Unit would be used by  Mayday  during his  turn ). This is corrected in the dub. 
 In the dub, after the effect of " Gauntlet Launcher " was blocked, Yuma erroneously declared a  direct attack  on  Mayday , when in fact it was actually directed to  Brooke , hence why Mayday activated his " Xyz Move " Trap to protect Brooke. 
 Italian dub 
 When  Anna   activates  " Upgrade ", she says that she's  Summoning  it. 
 When  Yuma  activates " Rank-Up-Magic Limited Barian's Force ", he instead says that he's activating " Barian's Force ". 
 Notes 
 
 ↑  1.0   1.1   This card can be seen in  Anna 's  hand  when  Astral  reminds  Yuma  how many  Life Points  Anna has.
