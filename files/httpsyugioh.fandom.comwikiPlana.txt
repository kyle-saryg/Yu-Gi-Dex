This article is about the life force. For the character known as Prana in VR, see  Sera .      
 Prana  (プラナ  Purana ), known as  Plana  in the English dub of  Yu-Gi-Oh! The Dark Side of Dimensions , is an almighty power or collective consciousness wielded by  Aigami ,  Sera ,  Mani  and many other unnamed characters. It is described as the ability to bend reality to the user's will and to create a world without evil or fear. According to  Shadi , it was bestowed upon Aigami's group when  Atem  departed for the afterlife. However, should the pharaoh ever return, they will lose the Prana forever, which ultimately drives Aigami to attempt to kill  Yugi .
 
 Trivia 
 The power is a "one time deal", as opposed to a "revolving door"; despite the pharaoh leaving for the afterlife a second time, the power remained gone forever. 
 It's Diva's own fault the plana was lost. Had he not attempted to stop Kaiba's recovery of the puzzle, the  Millennium Ring  would not have caused him to turn into  Dark Diva  and pose such a major threat that it forced  Atem  to return. 
 The names "Prana" and "Plana" for this power both make sense:  prāṇa  or "Breath of Life" is a Sanskrit word for the vital energy that permeates and suffuses reality; 'plana' is plural for the word 'planum' which means a geometric extension through space created from multiple points, reflecting the theme of the  Quantum Cube  as well as the nature of a collective consciousness created from multiple individuals. Both definitions fit the  Cubic  theme of Diva's deck.
