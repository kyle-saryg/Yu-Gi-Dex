 Summary 
 Satellite factory Duel 
 " Underworld Dragon Dragonecro " attacks " Lightning Warrior ", but  Yusei  protects it with " Junk Shield ", negating the attack. Dragonecro instead takes a bite from an overhead pipe. "Junk Shield's" second effect is to inflict the damage Yusei would have take from the battle to his opponent. However the  Skeleton Knight   chains  " Phantom Effect ", negating the damage and spawning a " Phantom Token " with  ATK  equal to the damage he would have taken. The Token has 600 ATK.
 The Phantoms chase after Yusei and the Knight laughs that Yusei should just give up. Yusei speeds up and drives through a wall of fire. He comes out intact and activates " Synchro Gazer ",  Releasing  " Lightning Warrior " to switch all of the Knight's monsters to  Defense Mode  and inflict 200 damage to the knight for each monster shifted. The Knight's 2 monster both switch to Defense Mode, where they sit with 0  DEF . With the Skeleton Knight overhead, "Lightning Warrior" soars up and smashes through the pipe he's running along. The Skeleton Knight's  Life Points  drop to 100 and he stops in his tracks before the gap in the pipe Yusei has created.
 Sect  points out that a player loses a  Turbo Duel  if they stop their  Duel Runner , or horse in this case. Since Yusei is still going, he wins by default.
 The Skeleton Knight congratulates Yusei on stopping his  D-Horse . He starts to disappear, but asks Yusei his name, before vanishing.
 Yusei realizes the altar has disappeared and runs over to check on Sect, but finds he's not okay.
 
 Public Security Maintenance Bureau 
 Inside  Goodwin's  office,  Mina  reports to Goodwin that someone has arrived in  Satellite  as they planned. Goodwin requests that she make preperations for the  D1 Grand Prix . Goodwin then says to himself "... Yes, you needn't move on your own, my son, the absolute ruler of Turbo Duels,  Jack Atlas ".
 Meanwhile over in Satellite, Jack has just arrived with  a large scythe wielding monster  behind him.
 
 Featured Duel: Yusei Fudo vs. Skeleton Knight 
 Duel continues from  the previous Ride . 
 " Underworld Dragon Dragonecro "  attacks  " Lightning Warrior ", but Yusei activates his  face-down  " Junk Shield ", preventing "Lightning Warrior" for being  destroyed by battle  and  negating  the  Battle Damage ; then, it would  inflict  the  damage  to the Skeleton Knight instead, but he  chains  " Phantom Effect ", negating the damage from "Junk Shield" and  Special Summoning  a " Phantom Token " with  ATK  equal to the negated damage (600/0). Yusei activates " Synchro Gazer ",  Tributing  "Lightning Warrior" to switch the Skeleton Knight's monsters to  Defense Position  and inflict 200 damage to the Knight for each monster switched. (Skeleton Knight: 500 → 100)
 At that time, the Skeleton Knight's  Dueling Horse  stops, which causes him to lose the  Duel .
