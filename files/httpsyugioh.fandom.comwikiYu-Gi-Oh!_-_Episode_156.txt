 Summary 
 
 This article  may require  cleanup  to meet this wiki's standards.   You can help out by re-organizing or re-writing parts of it or checking grammar and spelling.   
   This summary is currently incomplete. 
 Rafael  traps  Yami Yugi  on the  butte  by cutting off the rope bridge that connects it to the surrounding area, thus ensuring no-one can leave or interfere with their  Duel . Denying Yami Yugi's accusations of being "evil", Rafael questions what he understands for "justice" instead. He claims that history itself decides if the road  Doma  walks upon is evil or not. 
 Rafael reveals a Deck of " Guardian " monsters, which were his sole companions when he was shipwrecked on an island for three years as a child, losing his parents, brother, and sister. He signals how some of his Cards are slightly blurry, revealing they got wet time before. He's replaced the backside so as not to be recognizable this way, but it doesn't change the fact that they've supported him. He always kept his cards safe, and his current strategy reflects that bond; he will pay any cost to keep his monsters out of the Graveyard, as he doesn't want to lose anyone else.
 One day he was shown a vision of a mysterious island and a voice,  Dartz 's, told him that when he would understand everything, he would be allowed to come to his side. When he was finally rescued from the island, he found the normal world depressing. That was when he was approached by Dartz and joined Doma, hoping to find the answer to "fate" itself.
 One of the Monsters, " Guardian Eatos ", was his birthday present just before the wreck.
 On a side note,  Weevil  and  Rex  arrive in the midst of the Duel and look on.
 Also, Yugi's friends realize that he's gone off alone:  Joey ,  Tristan  and  Duke Devlin  will go look for him.  Téa  and  Rebecca  stay in the trailer to take care of  Professor Hawkins .
 
 Featured Duel: Rafael vs. Yami Yugi - Part 1 
 Turn 1: Rafael 
Rafael draws. He then activates " Guardian Treasure " to  discard  five cards and  draw  two cards. Now while "Guardian Treasure" is face-up, Rafael may draw one extra card from his  Deck  during each of his  Draw Phases . Rafael  Sets  a  monster  and Sets a Card.
 Turn 2: Yami Yugi 
Yami Yugi draws " Gazelle the King of Mythical Beasts ". He then activates " Polymerization " to fuse " Gazelle the King of Mythical Beasts " with " Berfomet " in order to  Fusion Summon  " Chimera the Flying Mythical Beast " from his  Fusion Deck  (2100/1800) in  Attack Position . "Chimera"  attacks  Rafael's  face-down  monster, " Backup Gardna " (500/2200). The attack fails ( Yami  4000 → 3900).
 Turn 3: Rafael 
Rafael draws. Due to the effect of his "Guardian Treasure", Rafael draws one extra card. Rafael then activates " Gravity Axe - Grarl ", equipping it to "Backup Gardna" and increasing the  ATK  of " Backup Gardna " by 500 (" Backup Gardna ": 500 → 1000/2200). Since " Gravity Axe - Grarl " is on the  field  and " Guardian Grarl " is the only Card in Rafael's  Hand , he  Special Summons  "Grarl" (2500/1000) from his hand in  Attack Position  via its own effect. 
 Rafael then activates the effect of "Backup Gardna" to unequip its "Gravity Axe - Grarl" and equip it to "Guardian Grarl" instead ("Backup Gardna": 1000 → 500/2200; "Guardian Grarl": 2500 → 3000/1000). "Guardian Grarl" attacks &  destroys  Yami Yugi's "Chimera the Flying Mythical Beast" ( Yami Yugi  3900 → 3000). Since "Chimera" was destroyed, Yami Yugi activates its effect to  Special Summon  "Berfomet" from his Graveyard (1400/1800) in  Attack Position .
 Turn 4: Yami Yugi 
Yami Yugi draws " Five Star Twilight " and subsequently activates it to Tribute "Berfomet" and  Special Summon  the five Kuriboh Brothers, " Kuriboh ", " Kuribah ", " Kuribee ", " Kuribeh " and " Kuriboo " in  Attack Position  (300/200 for all). Yami Yugi then activates the effect of "Kuribah" to  remove  "Kuriboh", "Kuribah", "Kuribee", "Kuribeh" and "Kuriboo" from play and  Special Summon  " Kuribabylon " (?/200) from his  Deck  in  Attack Position . Due to the effect of "Kuribabylon", its  ATK  is equal to the sum of the total  ATK  of all five Kuriboh Brothers (" Kuribabylon ": ? → 1500/200). Yami Yugi then activates " Pump Up " to double the ATK of "Kuribabylon" for 1  turn  (" Kuribabylon ": 1500 → 3000/200). 
 "Kuribabylon" attacks Rafael's "Guardian Grarl", but Rafael activates the effect of " Rescuer from the Grave " from his  Graveyard , removing from play five cards in his  Graveyard  in order to negate the attack and end the  Battle Phase . Yami Yugi then activates the effect of "Kuribabylon" to remove it from play and  Special Summon  "Kuriboh", "Kuribah", "Kuribee", "Kuribeh" and "Kuriboo" from the Removed from Play Zone to the field in  Attack Position  (300/200 for all).
 Turn 5: Rafael 
Rafael draws. Due to the effect of his "Guardian Treasure", Rafael draws one extra card. Rafael then Sets two cards (" Exchange " and " Self Tribute ") and activates his face-down " Purity of the Cemetery ". Now during each of Yami Yugi's  Standby Phases , Yami Yugi will receive 100  damage  for each monster present in his  Graveyard . If there is a monster in Rafael's Graveyard, "Purity of the Cemetery" will be destroyed. "Guardian Grarl" attacks "Kuriboh".
 Duel continues next episode. 
 
 Differences Between Adaptions 
 In the Japanese version, Rafael's parents were either presumed to be dead or confirmed to be dead as he visited their graves. His remaining relatives took his parents' inheritance and threw him out. In the dub, that scene of him visiting their graves were cut and he believed his family had forsaken him- since they were said to have been alive since they acquired lifeboats and never bothered to look for him even after he gained recognition as being a "miracle boy". 
 When Rebecca was doing research in the original, apart from mentioning Rafael's shipwreck, she also mentioned she wasn't the first national Duel Monsters champion of the United States, but Rafael was. In the dub, she only mentioned the shipwreck. 
 In the Japanese dub, Rafael flipped his Guardian cards around to show he pasted new covers on the back of his cards to ensure he couldn't distinguished them from his other cards. In the English dub, he doesn't mention this nor does he show Yami the back of his cards.
