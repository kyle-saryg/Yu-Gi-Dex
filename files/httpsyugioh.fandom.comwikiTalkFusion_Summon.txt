 Can't attack the turn they are Summoned? 
 Does the rule that "Fusion Monsters are not allowed to attack in the turn they are Fusion Summoned" still apply, or have they removed that rule?  —This unsigned comment was made by  67.127.228.8  ( talk  •  contribs ) 15:23, 25 April 2009 (UTC) 
 
 That never was a rule in real life. It was during the Battle City part fo the anime and manga. It's been since dropped in the anime and manga too. --  Deltaneos  ( talk ) 16:09, 25 April 2009 (UTC)

 Unlimited Fusion Summoning? 
 I have a quick question. Can anyone do an unlimited amount of Fusion Summons in one turn? Or is there a cap on it? It doesn't really say anywhere.
 Say, for example, one used Polymerization to fuse Elemental HERO Ocean and Elemental HERO Woodsman to summon Elemental HERO Terra Firma, then used Miracle Fusion with the same monsters to summon Elemental HERO Great Tornado, then used Parallel World Fusion with the same monsters to summon Elemental HERO Absolute Zero. Is something like that legal?

 There is no limit, but Parrel World Fusion can't be used on the turn you summon a monster(s). But yeah, you can Fusion Summon as many times as you can, depending if you have enough fusion cards and materials.  Adamtheamazing64  ( talk  •  contribs ) 01:37, October 25, 2011 (UTC)
