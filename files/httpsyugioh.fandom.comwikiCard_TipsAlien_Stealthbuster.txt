 If you control a monster that has the Damage Step effect involving  A-Counters  (" Alien Kid ", " Alien Overlord ", " Alien Skull ", " Alien Telepath " or " Alien Warrior ") and it is attacked, activate an effect that sends this card from hand or Deck to the Graveyard, in order to place A-Counters on the attacking monster (if it can be targeted).
 Sending it via ""A" Cell Recombination Device" or " Alien Shocktrooper M-Frame " will add a total of six A-Counters on the attacking monster and reduce its ATK by 1800 during the Damage Step. 
 This card's Graveyard effect is easily enabled by the majority of cards that place A-Counters (other than itself) - including " Corruption Cell "A" ", " "A" Cell Breeding Device " and "Alien Overlord".
