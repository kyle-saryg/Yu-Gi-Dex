 Henry Tudor  is the  Yu-Gi-Oh! The Duelists of the Roses  incarnation of  Yami Yugi  and portrayal of  Henry Tudor  (Henry VII of England). He is the king of the Red Roses of Lancaster. In the beginning of the game he says that his name is Henry Tudor but he has become tiresome of this name and prefers to be called Yugi.
 He appears if the player chooses White Rose in the game after defeating  Bakura .
 A player can obtain " Carat Idol " by using the  Find  ability on square "D1" against Henry Tudor.
 
 Deck 
 Henry Tudor plays with a Deck mainly based on  Yugi Muto 's  Duelist Kingdom  Deck, but also contains " Dark Magician Girl ". When the player faces Yugi, the field contains every type of terrain and he has at least one monster who will gain strength from each terrain, except Sea and Crush.
 Yugi is capable of receiving a  Destiny Draw , allowing him to get " Mirror Force " or " Raigeki ".
