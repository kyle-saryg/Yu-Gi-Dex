 Appearance and Personality 
 Pete is a thin man with long messy dark hair, wearing skin-tight black clothing, including detached sleeves. His eyes have thick dark outlines around them, though like other characters who demonstrate similar characteristics, it is unknown whether this is due to natural symptoms or make-up. 
 He demonstrates a prank-loving personality, hiding in the  Solid Vision  labs specifically to startle anyone who came down there. He also expressed an admiration of the Solid Vision system. Like all of the Card Professors, he was highly motivated by money. During his Duel with Jonouchi, he demonstrated a careful demeanor.
 
 Biography 
 Coppermine was hired with many other  Card Professors  to guard the  R.A. Project  by  Yako Tenma . He stationed himself in a laboratory-like room, containing  Solid Vision  holograms of mutated creatures floating in tubes. He himself hid in one of these tubes.  Katsuya Jonouchi  and  Hiroto Honda  ended up there and he pops out of the tube, startling Jonouchi. Pete informed Jonouchi that the reward for defeating him had increased since Jonouchi defeated  Klamath Osler . Pete  Dueled  Jonouchi, but was defeated, with Jonouchi chiding him for being careless. [1] 
 
 Deck 
 Pete uses a  Mutant Deck , which focuses on taking  control  of his opponents'  monsters  with the  effect  of " Mutant Mindmaster ".
