 Summary 
 Queen's Duel Academy 
 At  Queen's Duel Academy  there is great excitement over a "Queen of Queens" Duel taking place. Two students,  Mei  and  Sakura  rush through the hall, hoping to catch this  Turbo Duel .
 The Duel consists of  Akiza Izinski  facing  Ran Kobayakawa . Akiza has " Rose Witch " out, while Ran has " Orchid Moth ". Both players  Life Points  stand at 2000.
 Ran laughs that the title Queen of Queens shall be hers today. This title means nothing to Akiza, who gets "Rose Witch" to  attack  and  destroy  " Orchid Moth ", with her " Rose Whip " attack. Ran's Life Points lower to 1800. Ran is impressed and considers Akiza worthy of being her rival. Akiza  Sets  a card in her  Spell & Trap Card Zone  and ends her turn.
 Ran begins her turn, thinking that she shall win this move. She Summons " Orchid Mantis " and uses its effect, "Blooming Success". She  discards  her  hand  to inflict 500  damage  to her opponent for each card discarded. Since she got rid of 4 cards, Akiza's fans start to worry that will finish Akiza if it works.
 
         Ran  is knocked into the rosebush.     
 Akiza smiles that this is what it takes to make her classmates shriek. Akiza  chains  " Rose Blizzard ", preventing the damage and halving "Orchid Mantis'"  ATK . She tells Ran to get drunk on the smell of rose. Akiza's fans all cheer and remark on how splendid Akiza looks.
 Akiza begins her turn, using her "Foresee Draw", calling out the name of the monster, she is about to draw. As predicted, she draws " Queen Angel of Roses ". She  Releases  " Rose Witch ", who counts as 2 Tributes to Summon "Queen Angel of Roses". Akiza's fans scream in excitment over seeing Akiza's ace card. "Queen Angel of Roses" uses her "Rose Trimmer" attack, slicing "Orchid Mantis" into pieces and lowering Ran's Life Points to 0.
 
         Akiza's  loss to  Jack .     
 Ran loses control of her Duel Runner and falls into a rosebush. Upside down, with a rose between her teeth, Ran vows that she will get Akiza next time and Akiza accepts the challenge, from Ran or anyone else.
 A group of girls rush over to Akiza to congratulate her.  Sakura  gives her a towel. Akiza thanks her for it and Sakura is delighted that Akiza remembered her name.  Mei  informs Akiza that  Jack Atlas  is in  Satellite . Akiza asks if she is sure. Mei replies that she is certain, as she heard it from  her father  who serves the  Public Security Maintance Bureau . Akiza gets slightly upset, as she remembers falling to her knees in defeat, before Jack and his " King of Divine Punishment, Dark Highlander ". She then walks away, wondering what Jack is doing in Satellite.
 
 
 Satellite 
         Yusei  and the  doctor , at  Sect 's bedside.     
 At  Puzzle Hospital ,  Yusei  kneels next to  Sect 's bed, with the  doctor  standing next to them. Sect suffered a slight concussion. The doctor, who recalls Yusei arriving soaked with Sect, asks what happened last night. Yusei replies that he has to fix his  Duel Runner . The doctor insists that he needs to rest, but Yusei disregards this and leaves.
 As Yusei works on his Duel Runner, he reflects on his Duel with Jack. He tries to think why he lost; was it because Jack had a special Duel Runner, or special  Sense . He throws his wrench in frustration and says that it wasn't because Jack wasn't special in any way. It was because his  Turbo Duel  didn't work against the King.
 
         Lazar  approaches Yusei.     
 He curses and  Lazar  appears. Lazar comments that the yearn for victory while cursing defeat is the kind of pure soul that is needed for any  Turbo Duelist . Yusei asks this man who he is. Lazar replies that he is the one, who will heal Yusei's yearning and tosses him an envelope. He has come to invite the greatest Turbo Duelist in Satellite to the  D1 Grand Prix , an event, which the King will also be attending. What Yusei does is up to himself, Lazar informs Yusei and laughs.
