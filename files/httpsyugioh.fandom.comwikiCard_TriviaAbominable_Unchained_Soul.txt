 As indicated by the Lore, this monster could be the ancient wizard who was seal away in the artwork of " Abominable Chamber of the Unchained ", then used his power to make two duplicates (Aruha and Rakea) to help him escape.
 Fitting, since half of this monster's ATK (3000) is 1500, the same ATK as the Twin monsters. 
 This monster's effect to summon himself from the hand or  GY , might be eluding to his seal being broken, being released from his imprisonment, and when he leaves the field and put at the bottom of the deck could be referencing him being sealed again, since almost all the the cards can summon him from the deck.
