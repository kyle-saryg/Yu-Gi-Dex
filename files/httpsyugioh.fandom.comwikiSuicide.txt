Suicide  is an unofficial term used to describe when a  monster  purposely  attacks  another with an equal or greater  ATK , which (on success) would guarantee the said monster to be destroyed (sent to graveyard). This is in opposite with the standard approach of  not  attacking monster that would cause the attacker monster to be destroyed in the process. This is also commonly called  ramming ,  kamikaze , or - in cases when the monsters have equal ATK - a  double KO  or  crashing . It is worth noting that if two monsters with 0 ATK attack each other, neither will be destroyed.
 This can be used tactically to  activate   effects  that only work when a monster is  sent  to the  Graveyard   by battle , such as those of " Pyramid Turtle ", " XX-Saber Emmersblade ", " Exploder Dragon ", " Dark Necrofear ", " Gigantes " or " D.D. Warrior Lady ". The loss to your  Life Points  is often worth the  field advantage  you gain through those effects (loss of LP does not apply to an attacking "Exploder Dragon", however). This tactic is often more useful than waiting for your opponent to destroy said monsters by battle, as the opponent may suspect these monsters and try to destroy them with card effects instead.
