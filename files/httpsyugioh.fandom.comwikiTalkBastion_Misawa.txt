 Where he go??? 
 He never came back in the fourth season and i know that he wasn't killed so where did Bastion end up. Did they leave him in the dimensions
 
 I think he was really killed by Yubel's Super Fusion God's "beam" powers. 
 actually, all returned except him and the guy with clouds. that guy died and bastian stayed with that girl.
