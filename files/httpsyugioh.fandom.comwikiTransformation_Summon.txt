 Transformation Summon
 
 
 A  Transformation Summon  ( 変 身 召 喚   Henshin Shōkan ) is when a  Fusion Monster  is  Special Summoned  using the effect of a specific card, and without using any  Fusion Materials  (and the Special Summon is not treated as a  Fusion Summon ). This type of Summon is featured in the  Yu-Gi-Oh! GX  manga  in " Masked HERO "  archetype .
 It essentially reduces the amount of cards used for a Fusion Monster by one, in that only one  monster  and a card such as " Mask Change " or " Form Change " is needed, as opposed to two or more monsters and " Polymerization ". [1]  However, the produced Fusion Monster tends to be less powerful than one Special Summoned by means of a regular Fusion Summon.
 
 Trivia 
 Although  Jaden Yuki  does not perform Transformation Summons in the  Yu-Gi-Oh! GX  anime, he does use " Metamorphosis " and " NEX ", both of which effectively use only one monster to summon Fusion Monsters that can only be summoned this way. These are " Elemental HERO Neo Bubbleman " (which was a Fusion Monster in the anime), " Elemental HERO Clay Guardian ", " Neo-Spacian Marine Dolphin ", and " Neo-Spacian Twinkle Moss ". 
 The TCG/OCG effect of " The Eye of Timaeus " resembles the mechanics of Transformation Summon, but it actually performs a Fusion Summon, using one Fusion Material. 
 The Japanese name for Transformation Summon ( Henshin Shōkan ) is a reference to the  Kamen Rider  series, whom the Masked HERO are based on. In this series, most of the Riders shout "Henshin" before transforming.
