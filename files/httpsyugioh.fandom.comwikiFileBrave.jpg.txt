 Etymology 
 Broder's dub name means "brother" in both Swedish and Danish.
 
 Voice/Mannerisms 
 In the dub, Broder speaks with a stereotypical surfer accent, using slang such as "wrecked" and "later, gator". His dubbed voice also resembles  Chazz Princeton 's, due to both characters sharing the same voice actor, Marc Thompson.
 
 Personality 
 Broder's personality is similar to that of Crow's, despite being his rival. Broder is a powerful duelist with a daring, rough outlook, whilst showing a caring side for children, due to him taking care of a group of orphans. This is shown through him being worried about Ginga's safety as he attempts to cheer for Crow by climbing a railing. After the aforementioned incident, Broder was awed by the amount of support the Satellite children gave to Crow [1] . He also shows good sportsmanship like his team members, celebrating with Team 5D's after the latter wins the WRGP. The celebration photos Carly takes explicitly shows Broder's newfound friendship with Crow, with the former hugging the latter [2] .
 
 Biography 
 History 
 Broder was a treasure hunter who traveled the world for riches. One day, he came across a group of kids that were left for dead after an unknown war caused by  Iliaster . He wishes to find a way to save them and stop the organization from destroying everything.
 Some time afterward, Broder, along with  Halldor , traveled to a distant island in search of the " Loki, Lord of the Aesir " card. Halldor revealed its location on a tree root hidden within a cave. Upon finding it, Broder steals it and tries to escape on a boat. However,  Dragan , Halldor, and  Sebastian  pursue him. During the chase, Broder's boat crashed against a boulder and sent him flying towards a pillar of rock. 
 However, the final  Rune Eye  manifested on his eye and a mysterious thunderbolt destroyed the pillar. After the three of them catch up with him, Broder says that they can have the card back, but Halldor says that "Loki" has chosen Broder as its wielder. The three join forces as the chosen Duelists of the " Aesir " monsters [3] 
 
 World Racing Grand Prix 
 Broder, along with his companions, were on a plane flying towards  New Domino City  for the  WRGP . At the same time, the  Three Pure Nobles  achieved  falsification of history . Broder, along with the others, noticed that their " Aesir " had protected them from the time wave. [4] 
 Later, Broder and his team appeared publicly to host an exhibition Duel against the other teams in the WRGP, where  Dragan  chose to Duel  Jack Atlas . During the Duel, after  Summoning  " Thor " and  attacking  " Red Dragon Archfiend ", the two  monsters  emit a strange wave of energy while battling. Because the force began to destroy the building, the Duel was called off. [5] 
 Later, Broder and his team witness the phenomenon in the sky and encounter  Yusei , Jack, and  Crow . Upon finding out that they were in the fight against  Iliaster , Yusei asks them to join forces with  Team 5D's . However, Halldor reveals that the three  Aesir  do not wish to ally themselves with the  Crimson Dragon  because  Yusei's father  had been the one who caused  Zero Reverse  and began all this. Because of this, they believe that Yusei himself also carries a destiny of destruction. [3] 
 Upon the day of their Duel against Team 5D's, Jack defeats Dragan with " Red Nova Dragon ", much to Broder's frustration. [6]  Broder quickly switches out with him and finishes Jack off by destroying "Thor" and  activating  its  effect . Crow is the next runner up and Broder proves to be more strategic and cunning than him. Crow attempts to force the "Aesir" to leave the field but is foiled by Broder at every turn. He also reveals his reason for fighting in the tournament, which is to protect all the children he had encountered that were orphaned by  Iliaster 's wars. He then Summons "Loki" and destroys Crow's " Black-Winged Dragon ", reducing his  Life Points  to 50. Crow retaliates by activating two " Black Wing "  Trap Cards  from his  Graveyard , which would inflict enough  effect damage  for Crow to win the Duel. However, Broder counters with his own Trap Card, and both Duelists'  Life Points  are reduced to 0, ending the Duel in a  DRAW . [7] [1] 
 Broder, along with  Sebastian  and Dragan, watch as Halldor Duels Yusei. Yusei, Summoning " Majestic Star Dragon ", attempted a counterattack, but Halldor stopped Yusei, much to Broder's excitement. Broder then watches as Yusei Summons " Shooting Star Dragon " and eventually defeats Harald, thus Broder's team loses. [8] [9] 
 
 Ark Cradle 
 After  Team 5D's  defeat  Team New World  and  Aporia , Broder runs onto the track to congratulate them along with  Halldor  and  Dragan . [10]  He also observed the  Divine Temple  cracking the sky and begin to descent upon  New Domino City . When the  Signers  begin to lose all hope of saving the city, Broder along with his team appear before them and show them by using the powers given to them by their gods they can power their  Valhallanders . [2]  After this he followed Dragan, Broder and  Bruno  to the  Old Ener-D  system where they used their  Aesir  monsters to gather enough Ener-D so that Harald could use " Rainbow Bridge Bifrost " to allow the Signers to gain passage to the Divine Temple in order to prevent it rotating negatively thus stopping it destroying New Domino City and any civilians within 30 miles of. During this event, their Valhallanders began to explode, so they couldn't hold the bridge longer. [11]  He and his teammates are later shown alive when  Z-one  told the people the city was about to be destroyed. [12]
