March lists 
 I know the last four years all had new Forbidden & Limited Lists on 1 March, but has it been confirmed officially that it will be the same this year? --  Deltaneos  ( talk ) 18:24, January 9, 2011 (UTC)
 
 I don't know. I wouldn't see any harm in extrapolating, since the timing has held fairly constant in the past, but I wouldn't be opposed to a {{ fact }} tag either (speaking of, would there be any problems/complaints with moving that template to {{ citation needed }}?).  「 ダイノ ガイ 千？！ 」 ?  ·  ☎ Dinoguy1000  21:28, January 9, 2011 (UTC) 
 I don't object to the renaming. --  Deltaneos  ( talk ) 22:36, January 16, 2011 (UTC)
