 Fourth Season? 
 Now this does not really apply to because I have seen the entire subbed fourth season, but I heard the 4Kids has decided not to do the fourth season of GX. Now that could be GX is over and they will skip to 5D's or someone else will make the english version. Does any one know if either of these rumors have any truth to them?

 In Canada, the Youth Television (YTV) channel will have the 4th season airing on September 4th.  —This unsigned comment was made by  J rock  ( talk  •  contribs ) 02:50, August 12, 2008 
 
 That...sucks (for me). Does 4Kids have anything to do with it.  Dmaster  ( Contribs   •   Count ) 03:07, 12 August 2008 (UTC) 
 Plotholes 
 Finished watching season 4 yesterday. There are some strange plotholes which seem to have carried all the way from season 1. For one, when they graduate, it seems people who had already been at the school (for at least a year) before Jaden arrived, graduate when he does. Alexis for instance. Even Atticus who at some point vanished, then reappears and then just graduates (BTW, what is up with the insinuated incest in the jap version?). Then there's Bastian who was just left behind for no real apparent reason, yet Syrus's older brother was washed up on shore? That's some shitty writing right there. I guess it's just the distaste it has left in my mouth, after all, the first yugioh season had much better writing and at least cleaned up everything in the end. Who knows, maybe it's not really their fault, but instead because season 4 was cut so short. Felt very rushed compared to the usual pacing, but it was a welcome change, no more time wasting.  —This unsigned comment was made by  86.133.1.109  ( talk  •  contribs ) 18:57, April 19, 2010 
 
 When was it established that Alexis was at the Academy before Jaden? Judging from the fact that they always took classes together, one would assume they were in the same year. Atticus disappeared for some time, so it was only natural that he had to catch up. The incest part is only in the minds of people like you. Bastion was always the neglected one, plus he wasn't "sent to the stars", as the English version puts it. And there can be any number of reasons for why Syrus' brother appeared the way he did. PoirotH  19:10, April 19, 2010 (UTC)
 Additionally to what PoirotH said, the final season was not renewed for a 5th, and as such, the final season had to be shorter. Cramming more info into less space is a difficult thing to do. As for Alexis, her knowledge of the Academy was due to her brother having attended before her, so she already knew Zane and a few other Obelisk Blue students.  DemonGodAsura  19:28, April 19, 2010 (UTC)
 As far as Atticus goes, he would have been in his third year when Jaden was in his first. So he presumably disappeared sometime during his own second year. When he resurfaces, he would have had to repeat the remainder of his second year, and presumably his third year as well. Also keep in mind that both Seasons 3 and 4 take place during Jaden's  third  year at Duel Academy. As for Bastion, he CHOSE to stay in the alternate dimension with Tania. And yeah, Zane resurfacing wasn't very well received by the fanbase in general. In addition to MessengeroftheDark's explanation, Alexis (and Chazz for that matter) were first years along with Jaden. Because they were accepted into Blue, they were permitted to travel around to the various entrance exams to watch their peer qualify. Just another perk of being in Blue, really. All that being said, there are plenty of other "plotholes" that really are so - they have no given explanation. I had hoped that the 10th anniversary movie was address some of them, but all indications seem to say that it didn't.  Cheesedude  20:24, April 19, 2010 (UTC)
 Woah. Hold up. In episode 1, you see Chazz, Alexis, and Zane watching the entrance exams. They are already in the academy by the time Jaden gets in (they hadn't just passed the exam, or else they would be with Bastion and Syrus). They were not in Jaden's class. Of course, Zane graduates in Season 1. Chazz drops out, goes to North Academy, drops out from there, and then re-enrolls into Duel Academy, and as Professor Banner says, he starts over. So, that moves him down to Jaden's class. Alexis? Total plothole right there. Now, I will respect DemonGodAsura to the end of the earth, but what he said up there was wrong. -- GoldenSandslash15  ( talk  •  contribs ) 04:03, July 23, 2010 (UTC) 
 He had to start over in the Red dorm since he was now technically a transfer student. If he had been a second year to begin with, he would have remained so. Sartorius transfers in as a third-year student (the dub does change this to first, however). Chazz and Alexis were both in the same year as Jaden. The entrance exams that we saw were for a small area, which Bastion and Syrus also obviously lived in. Alexis and Chazz simply must have lived in another area, and took the exams at that location. It was also stated that anyone accepted into Blue was able to travel with the teachers to the rest of the exams to watch.  Cheesedude  ( talk  •  contribs ) 04:29, July 23, 2010 (UTC) 
 Dubbing of the 4th season 
 The article says:
 "Stay tuned for updates... (4/13/2010) The Anime should be making a return Fall of 2010. However, the unveiling of the 4Kids Fall lineup seems to indicate those plans have been canceled. Some said it's put on a very long hiatus." 
 I've looked at that for a long time, and something didn't seem right about it. Then I noticed it. It says the  Fall of 2010  Since when did 4kids release the fall lineup for 2010? It seems unlikely that they would release it this early. Also, it seems that that part of the article has been there for a long time. Did someone confuse this with the Fall Lineup of 2009. Anyway, I hope they do dub the fourth season of GX.-- Qim1  23:31, April 21, 2010 (UTC)

 Postonage of GX not of 5d's? 
 I was watching some old episodes of GX, and on i think episode 151, Yubel said F****d! that might be why it was postponed -- Gmn1997  ( talk  •  contribs ) 22:46, August 26, 2010 (UTC)
 
 An English dub, or the original Japanese episode? English profanity doesn't carry nearly the same impact among Japanese speakers that it does among English speakers, and it's not unusual to see even children's anime series drop the occasional f-bomb - advertisers, in fact, have been known to use the word on signs and billboards there. If the word was in the Japanese dub, then, it'd simply be replaced in the redubbing and wouldn't have any effect on whether the episode was postponed or not.  「 ダイノ ガイ 千？！ 」 ?  ·  Talk⇒Dinoguy1000  21:55, August 30, 2010 (UTC) 
 I think Gmn1997 is referring to Yubel saying it in episode 154 of the English version and is suggesting that 4Kids got in trouble for saying it and were forced to stop the series. This isn't true, she says " fight ". --  Deltaneos  ( talk ) 22:23, August 30, 2010 (UTC) 
 Bad Graphics? 
 Is it just me, or has anyone else noticed that the summoned monsters in GX, in the holographic duels especially, look very different from the way that they are depicted upon the cards, or in Yu-Gi-Oh! or 5DS? For example, whenever a slightly humanoid monster is summoned, they are digitally altered to the point where you don't even recognize them anymore!  —This unsigned comment was made by  128.107.239.234  ( talk  •  contribs ) 05:09, September 1, 2010

 Timeframe. 
 4Kids  new website  states that the series takes place ten years after DM ends. According to  episode 156 , Jaden enters  Duel Academy  in 2004. This would put DM's ending in 1994. However, I have heard several people in the past reference that the manga states that DM takes place in 1996. I would like to input information about the timeframe into this article, with citations. Thoughts?  Cheesedude  ( talk  •  contribs ) 23:09, January 14, 2011 (UTC)
 
 If you can find a source for DM taking place in '96 (which would make a lot of sense, since that's when  the series was started , a write-up couldn't hurt. It could be, also, that GX is indeed supposed to be set 10 years after DM  and  set in 2004; if that is the case, though, it's because someone either didn't know all the dates already mentioned, or wasn't paying enough attention to their maths. Regardless, this would all be a good entry for a  Timeline  article (the current  timeline  articles are specifically for real-world events; that one would be for an in-universe timeline).  「 ダイノ ガイ 千？！ 」 ?  ·  ☎ Dinoguy1000  23:44, January 14, 2011 (UTC) 
 The 4Kids timeframe doesn't necessarily hold true for the original Japanese version. e.g. they say Atem's time was 5000 years ago, rather than 3000. If the  Yu-Gi-Oh!  manga and  Yu-Gi-Oh!  anime are set in the same time, it's unlikely the  Yu-Gi-Oh!  anime is set in 1994. e.g. The  Yovega Fireboy  appears near the start of the manga and has the year 1997 printed on it. There's no reason that that year would be printed on 1994/5 product. --  Deltaneos  ( talk ) 23:49, January 14, 2011 (UTC)
 I realize that. The fact that the timeframe 4Kids listed may not apply to the Japanese version is why I posted this here in the first place.  Cheesedude  ( talk  •  contribs ) 23:55, January 14, 2011 (UTC) 
 Time period 
 I have a really good question.  In the last episode of Yugioh Gx Jadens duels Yugi and the pharoh while in the last episode of Yugioh the pharoh is sealed in his tomb.  Since Yugioh Gx is supposed to take place 10 years after the end of the regular series how is this possible?  —This unsigned comment was made by  66.74.35.21  ( talk  •  contribs ) 01:51, July 5, 2011

 Target Audience 
 The current article implies GX was targeted towards the younger audience. Hello, the original was aimed at young children as well. Or is the Japanese elitism crowding the editors' brains?  —This unsigned comment was made by  98.88.146.23  ( talk  •  contribs ) 17:23, July 29, 2011 
 
 Yes, it was all 4kids' fault for make it target toward young peoples. But at least 4kids is under trouble with funimation. -- F r e d C a t  17:27, July 29, 2011 (UTC) 
 Yeah, you're right. That should be probably be edited. I'll get rid of it.  Cheesedude  ( talk  •  contribs ) 17:33, July 29, 2011 (UTC) 
 Couldnt now they dub Yu-Gi-Oh GX because 4kids went into bankraucy if people ask 4K Acquisition Corp to dub the series now that that 4K Acquisition Corp has the american rights to air it.  —This unsigned comment was made by  122.57.233.90  ( talk  •  contribs ) 05:25, November 3, 2012
