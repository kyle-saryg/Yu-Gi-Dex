 Anime Bandai Konami's Yu-Gi-Oh! Duel Monsters Manga Manga Toei anime Yu-Gi-Oh! The Duelists of the Roses Yu-Gi-Oh! D Team ZEXAL 
 
 In the  first series anime , this card has slightly different artworks. 
 This card's International artwork was completely redrawn, removing the  Ankh  symbol to avoid religious connotations. Some International manga and video games still use the original Japanese artwork.
 Despite this, many Japanese players were cited as preferring the design of the International artwork over the original Japanese artwork, leading to the International artwork being referenced in the designs of cards such as " Monster Reincarnation " and " Xyz Reborn " [ citation needed ] . A Japanese language version of this card with its International artwork would finally be printed as an extremely rare promotional card among the three  Yu-Gi-Oh! World Championship 2017 attendance cards . 
 In  Yu-Gi-Oh! Duel Monsters 4: Battle of Great Duelist , this card was drawn with a different artwork.
