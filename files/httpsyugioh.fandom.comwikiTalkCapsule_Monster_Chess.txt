Capsule Monster Coliseum =/= CapMon? 
 My edit to this article to mention the Yu-Gi-Oh! Capsule Monster Coliseum video game was removed. I'm not going to add it back and start a fight, but I'd kind of like to know why...
 The comment in the revision history says that Capsule Monster Coliseum uses the rules of the Capsule Monsters board game based on the Yu-Gi-Oh! Capsule Monsters series, but it came out long before that series. (I'm not sure how long before, but I've owned the game for several years.)
 I haven't watched Capsule Monsters, but the rules of Capsule Monster Coliseum are very close to the rules of the game as played in the manga and the first anime series, with a few additions. Also, some of Mokuba and Yami no Yuugi's dialog in the game suggests that it is supposed to be the same game -- Mokuba brags about how good he is, much like in the manga, and Yami no Yuugi points out that he's already beaten Mokuba at this game.
 I could be wrong, which is why I'm not adding it back, but... I don't THINK I'm wrong.  64.13.15.31  17:13, 18 September 2008 (UTC)
