 Card text  (カードテキスト  kādo tekisuto ), also known as the  card description , [1]  is an area on cards containing  effect  text that details how a card affects gameplay, or, on  Normal   Monster Cards , flavor text describing the monster. Card text is located in the Card Description box, [2]  which also contains the card's  Type ,  ATK , and  DEF  (on Monster Cards), and is located beneath the card's artwork.
 The flavor text on  Normal Monsters  almost always only contains lore about the monster (leading to its popular name "lore" or "lore text"); in languages using the Latin alphabet, this text is italicized to indicate that it has no effect on gameplay. Normal Monsters may rarely contain an  archetype condition , which is not italic (as it has an effect on gameplay) and is listed at the bottom of the Card Description box.
 On all other cards, the card text contains the  card effect (s) as well as any  costs ,  conditions , and  Materials . If a card lists Materials, these will be listed first on their own line.
 
 Errata 
 Main article:  Errata 
 Card text often receives errata between printings. This is used for a variety of reasons, including to correct mistakes and mistranslations, correct  archetype  membership, and to improve clarity.
 In the Japanese  OCG , starting from  Starter Deck 2014 , various terms such as 「シンクロ」 ("Synchro"), 「エクシーズ」 ("Xyz"), and 「ペンデュラム」 ("Pendulum") have been abbreviated to the single characters 「 Ｓ 」, 「 Ｘ 」, and 「 Ｐ 」 to save space on card text. The term 「ライフポイント」 ("Life Points") has been similarly abbreviated to 「 ＬＰ 」. The latter is the only one of these abbreviations that has been carried over to other languages, where "Life Points" is now abbreviated "LP" in the card text of several Latin-alphabet languages (except for Portuguese, in which it is abbreviated "PV" instead) as well as in the Korean  OCG .
 
 Card text standardization and clarification efforts 
 There have been two major attempts to standardize and clarify the card text in the TCG.
 The first was the  Simplified Effect Text , which shortened several common phrases by taking out implied words or rephrasing the phrase altogether. The Simplified Effect Text has been used on all cards released since  Power of the Duelist , until the introduction of the next text standardization.
 The second was the  Problem-Solving Card Text , which uses a highly consistent structure for all cards to minimize the need for card rulings. It has been used on all cards released in  Booster Packs  since  Generation Force  and all cards released in  Starter Decks  since  Starter Deck: Dawn of the Xyz .
