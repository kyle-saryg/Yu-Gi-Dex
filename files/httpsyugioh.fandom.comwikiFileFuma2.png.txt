 Appearance 
 Fender is a tall, muscular man with long, lavender hair with several ebony bangs. He wears a dark gray vest with a brown collar and black pants and shoes.
 When using the power of Barian, such as using " Rank-Up-Magic Barian's Force ", he gains a  Barian Emblem  on his forehead, like  Dr. Faker  when he was possessed by  Vector .
 Also, while using this kind of power, Fender is able to Duel without a  Duel Gazer . Instead, his left eye changes to red.
 
 Biography 
 Fender led a gang of thugs, who successfully robbed a large sum of money from an armored car. Fender mentioned he wanted more power.  Girag  appeared from a portal and teleported his way through Fender's thugs, avoiding their attacks. When he reached Fender, Fender punched him in the face, but Girag shrugged it off as if nothing had happened. Hoisting Fender by the neck, he threw him to the ground. Using a card, " Rank-Up-Magic Barian's Force ", Girag promised him great power and hypnotized him and his thugs. He ordered Fender to find  Yuma Tsukumo . To that end, he Dueled and defeated Yuma's friends,  Bronk Stone ,  Cathy Katherine ,  Caswell Francis  and  Flip Turner  at  Heartland Academy . Taking Bronk's  Duel Gazer , he contacted Yuma and Yuma came to him. They began a Duel, with Fender using "Barian's Force" to evolve " Mechequipped Angineer " to " CXyz Mechquipped Djinn Angeneral ", pushing Yuma into a corner. [1] . However, after an appearance by  Tori Meadows  and the reappearance of  Astral , Yuma was able to win via a combo of " Number C39: Utopia Ray " and " Numbers Impact ". Despite the loss, Fender informed Yuma that his gang would arrive at school soon, but  Shark  and  Kite Tenjo  arrived, saying that they defeated the gang by themselves before arriving at school, much to Fender's surprise. Fender was then electrocuted and knocked out by  Orbital 7 , undoing Girag's brainwashing in the process. [2]
