 Defense Position  (Japanese:  守 備 表 示   Shubi Hyōji ; English-dubbed anime: Defense Mode) is a  Battle position  in which a  Monster Card  can be either  face-up  or  face-down , in a horizontal position. In this position, the  DEF  value is used to represent this card, except where a card effect requires a specific examination of the  ATK  value.

 Placement 
 In Defense Position, a Monster Card is always placed horizontally in its  Monster Card Zone , rotated 90 degrees counterclockwise from its  Attack Position  as seen by its owner. When a monster is  Set , it is played in  face-down  Defense Position.
 Monsters cannot be  Normal Summoned  in  face-up  Defense Position, except by a card effect that allows them to be Summoned that way (such as " Light of Intervention "). During a battle involving a Defense Position monster, the DEF value of  that  monster is used to calculate  Battle damage , rather than the ATK value.
 
 Link Monster 
 Main article:  Link Monster 
 As  Link Monsters  do not have DEF, they cannot be Summoned in and/or changed to Defense Position.
 
 In Battle 
 See also:  Defense Position attacker 
 Usually, Defense Position monsters cannot attack, but some monsters such as " Elemental HERO Rampart Blaster " and " Total Defense Shogun " have effects that allow them to attack while in Defense Position. In that case, they will still use their ATK for Damage Calculation. Some " Superheavy Samurai " monsters can attack in Defense Position, but apply their DEF instead of their ATK as their ATK during damage calculation. 
 
 Main articles:  Damage calculation  and  Piercing 
 If a Defense Position monster is attacked, the attacked player will take no damage. However, there are cards that inflict  piercing  damage, which lets a monster inflict damage in this way. If the attacker has lower ATK than the DEF of the attack target, the attacker takes Battle Damage, but neither monster is destroyed. If the attacker's ATK is equal to the target's DEF, neither player takes Battle Damage and neither monster is destroyed.
 
 In the anime 
 In the earlier anime, a player is able to, and usually does, Normal Summon their monsters in face-up Defense Position without the aid of card effects; if a monster were to be  Set , it typically had a  flip effect . Starting from  Yu-Gi-Oh! ZEXAL , this is no longer true, the rules aligned with the  TCG/OCG  and as such ,  a player must either Normal Summon a monster in face-up Attack Position or Set it in face-down Defense Position.
 Also, the materialized Monster Cards in face-up Defense Position have their said position illustrated; in  Yu-Gi-Oh!  and  Yu-Gi-Oh! GX  the monsters will crouch into a defensive pose above an enlarged likeness of the actual card placed in the conventional Defense Position. In  Yu-Gi-Oh! 5D's , they become blue-colored. In  Yu-Gi-Oh! ZEXAL , the monsters return to simple defensive poses. In  Yu-Gi-Oh! ARC-V , they glow with a blue aura. In  Yu-Gi-Oh! VRAINS , the monster's appearance remains unchanged regardless of battle position.
