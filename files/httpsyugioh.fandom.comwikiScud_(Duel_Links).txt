 Trivia

 Winning: "That was fun while it lasted! Hahahaha!". 
 Ishizu Ishtar ,  Tristan Taylor (DM) ,  Aigami ,  Sera , Scud,  Prana ,  Blair Flannigan , and  Carly Carmine  are the only Legendary Duelists who do not have a cutscene for when they Summon their ace monster(s). Although it should be noted that none of them, excluding Blair, possessed an ace monster with which to begin.
