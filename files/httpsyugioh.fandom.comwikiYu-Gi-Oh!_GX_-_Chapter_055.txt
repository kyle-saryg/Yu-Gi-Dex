 The Mystery of the Planet Series!! 
 
 "The Terror of the Forbidden Beasts!!" , known as  "The Terror of the Sealed Beasts!!"  in the Japanese version is the fifty-fifth chapter of the  Yu-Gi-Oh! GX  manga . It was first printed in Japanese in the  V Jump  magazine and in English in the  Shonen Jump  magazine. Both of which were printed in  volume 8  of the  Yu-Gi-Oh! GX  graphic novels afterwards.
 Jaden  and  Adrian  continue their  Duel , with Adrian wielding " The Despair Uranus " in consort with his " Forbidden Beasts " and Jaden attempting counterattacks with his " Masked Heroes ".
 
 Summary 
   This summary is currently incomplete. 
 Jaden  continues his  Duel  with  Adrian , who makes the first strike with his " Forbidden Beast Nibunu ". Jaden makes a comeback with " Masked Hero Acid ".  Tragoedia  muses on how " Winged Kuriboh " and " Elemental Hero Terra Firma " ended up in Jaden's possession. He thinks that he hasn't been this elated in years though, all the components he needs for his plans are near - the spirit card, the rest of the " Legendary Planets " and the souls of young Duelists. Adrian strikes back with " The Despair Uranus ". After its attack hits, Jaden feels his strength being sapped. He wonders if the Duel is a  Shadow Duel , but realizes that it seems to be solely "Uranus" emitting the energy, not the Duel as a whole. Jaden accuses Adrian of coming to take "Winged Kuriboh" from him, but Adrian denies having any interest in such a weak card. When  Winged Kuriboh  appears before Jaden, he promises to protect it. Adrian tells Jaden to stop talking to himself, implying that he can't see Duel Spirits. Jaden vows to end the Duel this turn.
