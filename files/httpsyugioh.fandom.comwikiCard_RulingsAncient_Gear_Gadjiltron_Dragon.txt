 Previously Official Rulings 
   These TCG rulings were issued by  Upper Deck Entertainment  and have since been deemed unofficial by Konami. [1]  They were previously considered official and can still be correct, as long as they follow the official gameplay rules, or unless Konami has issued a ruling that says otherwise.

 When you Tribute Summon this card by Tributing " Gadget " monsters, it does not start a chain. Gaining the appropriate effect(s) is a Continuous Effect. 
 If this card is flipped face-down, any effects it obtained from its Tribute Summon will disappear, even if flipped face-up again. 
 The effect granted by Tributing " Green Gadget " is a  Continuous Effect . 
 The effect granted by Tributing " Red Gadget " is a  Trigger Effect  that starts a chain when this card inflicts battle damage. 
 The effect granted by Tributing " Yellow Gadget " is a  Trigger Effect  that starts a chain when this card destroys an opponent's monster by battle. 
 If you Tribute 2 of the same " Gadget " to Tribute Summon this card, the effect does NOT duplicate. For example, if you Tributed 2 " Yellow Gadgets " this card will not do 1200 damage to your opponent when it destroys a monster by battle.
