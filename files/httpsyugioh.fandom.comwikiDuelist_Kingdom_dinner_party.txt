      The Duelist Kingdom dinner party in the anime.     
 The Duelist Kingdom dinner party is a event that takes place after the exhibition duel between  Kaiba  and  Pegasus . Here, it is announced that the duelists facing each other in the finals are chosen by random.
 In the anime, the Duelist Kingdom dinner party takes place during  Episode 28  of the first season.
 Each duelist is given a letter, sealed in a  fake replica of the Millenium Eye , which were placed inside the four finalist's soups. These would randomly decide each duelist's placement in the finals.  Joey  received "D",  Mai  received "B" and  Yugi  received "A". In the manga,  Bandit Keith  had not attended and was given "C" by default.
 It was also announced that in order to win the prize of three million dollars or the right to challenge  Pegasus  to a duel, each duelist would require either  "Glory Of The King's Hand"  or  "Glory Of The King's Opposite Hand"  cards. One of either of these cards would also be required in each of their duels in order to qualify.
 Joey  is upset, as he has neither card, but  Yugi  gives him his  "Glory Of The King's Hand"card  in order to win the three million for his  sister , and double their chances of one of them facing  Pegasus , as he already possessed  "Glory Of The King's Opposite Hand" .
 Bandit Keith  also has neither of these cards, so he later steals Joey's card and claims it as his own.  Joey  however is later saved by  Mai , who gives him her card after her loss against  Yami Yugi .
