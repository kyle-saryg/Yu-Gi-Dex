 Yusaku's main strategy involves using methodically calculated moves to overwhelm the opponent with Link Monsters. His early turns are usually slow, with him setting up his bigger combos for later while analyzing the opponent's strategies. To which, he will commonly rely on the Graveyard, either returning cards to his hand or activating their effects there. Once his field is set up, he Link Summons multiple Link-1 and Link-2 Link Monsters at once to then use them as Materials for his stronger ones, such as the Link-3 " Code Talkers " and Link-4 "Firewall Dragon". His other Link Monsters can also act as support for his primary ones.
 
       "Decode Talker" materializing into a real card.     
 After capturing Ai and unlocking the "Storm Access" Skill, he can obtain new Link Monsters when his  LP  are 1000 or below during a Speed Duel when a Data Storm is near. To this end, he usually allows himself to drop below 1000 LP. The Link Monsters gained this way expand his arsenal of monsters for the current Duel and future Duels alike, and typically help turn a disadvantageous situation in his favor. As shown with "Decode Talker", the data of the Link Monsters added by his Skill can materialize into real cards with the proper equipment. In case the opponent tries to prevent "Storm Access" from activating by not dealing damage, Yusaku also uses cards with effects that require him to pay LP to get around it.
 During his Duel with Gore, spectators likened this strategy to Gore's habit of letting his opponent take the lead, then making a comeback from a pinch.
 Yusaku also used three copies of "Sphere Kuriboh" as shields during his infiltration of SOL Technologies' data bank. Whether or not they are in his Deck is unknown. [1]

 Yusaku continues to supplement his Deck with Link Monsters gained from his "Storm Access" Skill and has received "Linkuriboh" from Ai. At some point after his Duel with Varis, Yusaku expanded his Deck to include other summoning methods (Ritual, Fusion, Synchro, and Xyz Summoning) as a way to both bring powerful monsters to the field and circumvent strategies designed to counter his Link Monsters. He supports these new Summoning methods with cards such as "Cyberse Witch", "Clock Spartoi", and "Cyberse Wicckid". He also shows less dependence on his "Code Talkers" than before and focuses more on using Link-2 monsters to support additional Summoning methods instead.

 In his final Duel with Ai, Yusaku uses a " Code Talker/Darkfluid " Deck focusing on summoning Link-2 monsters to quickly summon the "Code Talkers" he obtained through "Storm Access" throughout his journey, and even summon his non-Link Extra Deck monsters to both use their effects for defense and gain an upper hand. He supports this Deck with his new ace card "Accesscode Talker", a "Code Talker" that he never obtained from "Storm Access", and from its effect can destroy multiple cards at once as long as the monsters banished by its effect has a different Attribute.
 Also, should he get cornered, he can summon his most powerful monster that he used against Bohman - "Firewall Dragon Darkfluid" - which gains Counters from his non-Link ace monsters in his Graveyard, can negate multiple effects while also allowing "Darkfluid" to attack two times when this effect is used, which makes for a powerful attacker, and disrupt his opponent's strategies to try to counter.
 He also focuses over a card given to him by Varis: "Borreload Furious Dragon", a Dragon that is a Fusion counterpart to Varis' "Borreload Dragon" as a card that can destroy " Judgment Arrows " a Link Spell that was previously wielded by  Lightning's faction , and the card that is the symbol to the Ignis Warfare that Ai added to his Deck to share Lightning's views.

 Yusaku also used an unknown Deck to face opponents during the Hanoi Project.
 
 
 LIGHT 
 Additionally, Yusaku has a  LIGHT  dummy Deck for situations in real life where he has to show his Deck to other  Duelists . The Deck is extremely basic, in addition to using very old cards, to make it seem like Yusaku is a regular untalented Duelist.
