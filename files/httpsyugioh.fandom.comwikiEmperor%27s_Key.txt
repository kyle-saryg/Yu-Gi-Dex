 The  Emperor's Key  (皇の鍵,  Ō no Kagi ), sometimes shortened to  the Key  in both versions and also called the  Golden Key  in the dub, is a pendant that originated from the  Astral World  in the  Yu-Gi-Oh! ZEXAL  series.
 It is currently in possession of  Yuma Tsukumo  and he uses it to summon  Astral , which is similar to that of when  Yugi Muto  transforms into  Yami Yugi  with the power of the  Millenium Puzzle  (both items are also similar in that their owners are frequently shown wearing them around their necks, and they have been stolen from their respective owners on one or more accounts, only to be later recovered). The Key has an inside world which is the "pocket dimension", in which Astral spends most of his time. It has the power to subdue the influence of a " Numbers " and can open  The Door .

 Appearance

       Orbital 's analysis of the key.     
 The Key appears as a key with golden curves and a ring on top, allowing it to be worn around the owner's neck. It also has a green gem, which contains the "pocket dimension".
 
 Pocket Dimension 
 Within the Emperor's Key is a pocket dimension where  Astral  spends most of his time. [2]  In case the Key is taken from Yuma or Yuma loses it, Astral will be trapped inside this dimension if he is within it. [3]  However, that won't be the case if he is outside of the Key. [4] [5] 
 
         The pocket dimension within the Emperor's Key.     
 The pocket dimension is made up of energy similar to  Astral World  with floating particles along a white desert covering the whole place and in the air is a huge green airship. Gaining access to this world requires going through  The Door . [6]   Kite Tenjo  was able to get to the pocket dimension by using a  Baria Crystal . [7] 
 
 Different Dimension Airship 
 Main article:  Different Dimension Airship 
 In the middle of the pocket dimension is the  Different Dimension Airship , where Astral resides.
 
 Abilities 
         The key's restoration.     
 The key is very resilient and can even repair itself under certain circumstances. [8] [9] 
 
         The key failing to suppress the power of the "Chaos Number".     
 The Emperor's Key gives the user some resistance to the influence of the "Numbers". [10] [3]  It has at least once failed to fully suppress the power of a "Chaos Number", For example: When  Yuma  took control of " Number C32: Shark Drake Veiss " via " Rivals Unite ", it was causing him great pain until Shark used " Underwater Snow Prison " to banish it from the field. [11] 
 A  diabolical door  has haunted Yuma in his dreams trying to convince him to open it. The Emperor's Key was also the key to open that door, which released both Astral and the "Numbers"; and to do so, the broken key restored itself. [8]  When the Key got separated from Yuma, a voice said that "Astral is immersed in the guidance of time" and that he must obtain the power of " ZEXAL ". The voice described it as a power that turns all darkness into light. [3]  The Key has the power to release the alternate form, of a "Number" - " Chaos Number ". [12] 
 The "Numbers" have power inside the Key, as when Astral sent " Number 39: Utopia " off, the Key fired the card out of the Key and into Yuma's  Extra Deck . [13] 
 Additionally the key has the power to make Astral visible to anyone when it radiates strong energy, such as during Yuma's Duel against  Fortuno [12] , and when Yuma's friends were able to see Astral inside the cockpit of the  Different Dimension Airship . [14] 
 
 Anime history 
 Pre-series 
         Kazuma  obtains the Emperor's Key from the edge of the world.     
 Kazuma Tsukumo  received the Emperor's Key from a being similar to  Astral . This caused him to see an attack occurring in  Astral World . Kazuma later passed the key on to his son,  Yuma . [5] 
 Yuma held onto the key as a keepsake of his traveling parents and usually wore it around his neck. He felt that the key opened many possibilities and made him think he could take on any challenge. Despite this, Yuma suffered nightmares about  a demonic door , telling him that whoever opened it would receive great power at the cost of a great risk. The key would light up during these dreams. [8] 
 
 Yu-Gi-Oh! ZEXAL 
 One day,  Yuma  confronted  Reginald "Shark" Kastle  at school, over him stealing  Bronk Stone 's Deck through an  ante . During the encounter, Shark noticed Yuma's fondness of the key, so he swiped it. He proceeded to break it in front of Yuma and throw a piece away. Bronk managed to find the piece Shark threw away and later returned it to Yuma. [8] 
 The next day, Yuma confronted Shark in a Duel. Before they began,  Yuma  held up the piece of the key Bronk returned to him, and as he demonstrated his confidence, the other part of the key was transported from his house to his hand and the key repaired itself. Yuma was transported to the door from his dreams and this time, he inserted the key. The door was unlocked releasing  Astral . Yuma then returned to his Duel, with Astral by his side. [8] 
 
         Kite  and  Orbital  open the doorway into the key.     
The granted resistance to "Numbers" when  Number 96  tried to take " Utopia " from  Bronk Stone  by force, and when Bronk  Summoned  "Utopia". [10]  When  Shark  had the Key and took control of  Kite Tenjo 's " Acid Golem ". [3]           Yuma being sucked into the key.     However, the Key was unable to fully suppress the power of a "Chaos Number" when Yuma took control of " Number C32: Shark Drake Veiss ". Though the "Chaos Number" did not possess him, the connection to it weakened Yuma and surrounded him in a dark aura which was eventually electrified, causing him great pain.  Vetrix  pointed out that if Shark did not do something, Yuma would be taken over by the "Number" like he was. [11] 
 World Duel Carnival 
         Kazuma in front of the "Number" pillars     
 The original wielder of Key,  Kazuma Tsukumo , also has power over the Key as well. He mysteriously appeared in the Key and used the power of the 12 collected "Numbers" to break  Trey 's influence over  Yuma , allowing him to regain his " kattobingu ". [15]  Kazuma later returned to tell the revived  Astral  that his son is calling him for help. [16] 
 
 Yu-Gi-Oh! ZEXAL II 
         The Emperor's Key falls into the Astral World.     
 When Yuma Dueled against  Fender ,  Astral  (who was in the key) was electrocuted at times when Yuma's Life Points went down. [17]  When Yuma and Ray Dueled against  Girag , Yuma threw the key out of the  Barian's Sphere Field  to  Tori  once Astral was weakened from the effects of the field. [18]  After their Duel with  Number 96 , Astral was forced to return to Astral World and the key went with him, falling through the portal. [19] 
 Later on after Yuma's Duel against Eliphas concluded with the former's victory, he returned the key to Yuma. [20] 
 
         Yuma's key reacting with Nash's  Barian Emblem .     
 After meeting up with  Reginald Kastle  after he and  Rio Kastle  sided with the  Seven Barian Emperors , the Emperor's Key reacted with Nash's  Barian Emblem , letting Yuma observe Nash's past life while Nash witnessed the events that Yuma had been involved with in  Astral World . [21] 
 In the Key's pocket dimension, Astral and  Kazuma  discussed Yuma's future and the upcoming ceremonial Duel. [22]
