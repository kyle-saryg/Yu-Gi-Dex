 Summary 
   This summary is currently incomplete. 
 As  Yuya  starts off the duel by  Pendulum Summoning  three Performapal Card Gardnas in Defense mode, their Defense points increased by their effect,  Reiji  reminds Yuya they are only ones from their time here and expresses his intention to fight him with everything at his deck's disposal. While Yuya jokes that nobody would really buy that they came from the future, Reiji loses his cool as he expresses utter hatred towards Yuya's dad  Yusho  for the death of his father  Leo . Reiji explains that Yusho and Leo were the ones who developed the technology that enables  Solid Vision  with Mass. But Yusho left to become a  Dueltainer , his reasoning that the technology he and Leo developed would change the world yet fears it be abused for militant purposes. Leo agreed to help Yusho ensure their technology could be used in the positive way, their research in the Duel Monsters game resulting with the creation of the Pendulum Summoning method for Dueltainment.
 Reiji then explains to Yuya that their fathers' work has unforeseen consequences, creating an artificial virtual dimension whose mass is brought into their world via Solid Vision. It was from Leo exploring that dimension that  Genesis Omega Dragon  was brought to their reality, causing the destruction that Yuya and Reiji survived when they were sent back through time along with the Pendulum summoning technique. After Reiji uses his " D/D Scale Surveyor " to remove Yuya's ability to Pendulum summon, he has " D/D Count Surveyor " uses its effect to combine Yuya's Card Gardnas into one to be destroyed by " D/D/D Supersight King Zero Maxwell ". Reiji then adds that he will never allow Yuya to obtain control of the G.O.D. card.
