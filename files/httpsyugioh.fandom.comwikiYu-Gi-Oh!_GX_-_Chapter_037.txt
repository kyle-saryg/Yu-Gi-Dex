 Summary 
 Reggie MacKenzie  has Summoned " The Splendid Venus " in her duel against  Midori Hibiki . She explains that it was one of the  Legendary Planets , like  David Rabb 's " The Big Saturn " and  Jaden Yuki 's " Elemental Hero Terra Firma ". Reggie claims it's now time to end Midori's "lesson" and  destroys  " Darklord Edeh Arae " with "Venus", leaving Midori with 1500  Life Points . Reggie  Sets  a card and Midori begins her turn. She recalls Reggie stating that if she loses the duel, she may collapse just like David and  Koyo , and will thus be unable to tell Midori anything about Koyo's condition. Reggie claims her  face-down  card is " Angel's Mercy ", which would allow her to change the attack  target  when a  Fairy - Type   monster  is attacked. If "Venus" was attacked, Reggie would switch the target to " Zeriel ", which would result in her loss. Midori Sets a card, prolonging the duel in an attempt to find out more about Koyo's condition.
 Reggie knows she needs to hurry and finish the duel before Midori regains her wits. She  activates  " Angelic Choir ", increasing the  ATK  of "Venus" by 300 for each Fairy-Type monster she  controls , thus resulting in 3400 ATK. "Venus" destroys " Darklord Superbia ", reducing Midori to 1000 Life Points. Midori realizes that if she keeps this up, Reggie will defeat her. Reggie is still confident that Midori is shaken enough by the "chains of Koyo" not to attack. She Summons " Darklord Ukobach " in  Defense Position , also switching " Darklord Asmodeus " to Defense Position. Reggie knows that when humans are backed into a corner, they rely on instincts in order to preserve their own lives. She realizes that if she pushes too much, the "chains of Koyo" will break, and Midori will fight. Reggie  equips  "Zeriel" with " Angel Bow ", which will let it attack  directly  if Midori controls only Defense Position monsters.
 Winged Kuriboh  is still leading Jaden through the  Abandoned Dorm , leaving the latter perplexed. Reggie orders "Venus" to destroy "Asmodeus", while "Zeriel" attacks directly, leaving Midori with 700 Life Points. Jaden finally makes it their location, and realizes he's witnessing another  Shadow Duel . Reggie clarifies that Jaden will be up next after Midori loses. This spurs Midori to continue, determined to protect Jaden, remembering when she offered to be Jaden's big sister as he had no siblings of his own. Midori activates her face-down " Fallen Angel in Darkness ",  Tributing  "Ukoback" to  Special Summon  " Darklord Desire ". She activates its effect, reducing its ATK by 2000 to destroy both of Reggie's monsters. Knowing that this means that "Angelic Mercy" cannot be used, she attacks.
 Reggie reveals that she lied. Her Set card was not "Angel's Mercy", but " Angel's Tear ". This lets her  remove  "Zeriel", " Tethys, Goddess of Light " and two " Divine Spirit Parmals " in her Graveyard from play to Special Summon "Venus". She tells Midori that she's one turn too late. "Venus" becomes the new attack target, and Midori's Life Points reduce to zero. As Midori collapses, Reggie reveals that she has no idea how to awaken Koyo.
 Elsewhere,  Chazz Princeton  and  Zane Truesdale  have arrived at the volcano dueling arena via helicopter for their duel. Then, at the American Duel Academy, the  principal  declares that he will be personally visiting  Duel Academy  and intends to have  Jesse Anderson ,  Adrian Gecko ,  Jim Crocodile Cook ,  Axel Brodie  and  Aster Phoenix  accompany him.
