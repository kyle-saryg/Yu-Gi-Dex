 Turn 9: Yugi 
 Yugi   Sets  a card. All  monsters  lose 1  Life Star Counter  via " Cosmic Space ".
 Turn 10: Depre 
 Depre 's Set card is another copy of "Cosmic Space". He  Normal Summons  " Eva Epsilon " (1500/1600) in  Attack Position . " Greed Quasar "  attacks   directly  (Yugi 4000 → 400). "Eva Epsilon" attacks directly, but Yugi  activates  the  effect  of " Toy Box ",  Special Summoning  the " Toy Magician " (1600/1500) inside it. The attack is redirected to it, so "Eva Epsilon" is  destroyed  (Depre 4000 → 3900). Its effect activates, adding its Life Star Counters to "Greed Quasar", whose  ATK  and  DEF  become 4200. Yugi activates his face-down " Fit of Rage ", increasing the ATK of "Toy Magician" by the amount of  Battle Damage  he received this  turn  from direct attacks, though its total ATK will be halved during the  End Phase . Its ATK becomes 5200. Yugi activates his face-down " Strike Back ", allowing him to conduct a  Battle Phase  of his own after Depre ends his. "Toy Magician" attacks and destroys "Greed Quasar" (Depre 3900 → 2900). At the End Phase, all monsters lose a Life Star Counter via "Cosmic Space".
