 Biography 
       Shadow Giant vs.  Yuma Tsukumo .     
 When  Astral  attempted to access more of his memories,  the Door  appeared and spoke to him and out of it came the Shadow Giant. The Giant claimed it would test Astral's worthiness to access more memories from the " Numbers ". Using " Unformed Void " it was able to lock down Astral's "Numbers" and push  Yuma  and him into a corner. [1] 
 It was only with the intervention of  Number 96  that Yuma and Astral were able to push through and win. With this, Astral recovered more of his memories and learned his original mission - to find the  Numeron Code  before the  Barians  do. He also learned that the knowledge of the Code's location was with the "Numbers" he had not yet collected. However, he was also forced to release Number 96 in order to do so [1] 
 
 Deck 
 The Shadow Giant plays a  LIGHT   Aqua  Deck , focusing solely on bringing out " Unformed Void " and protecting it with " Overlay World ". With this combo, the opponent would most likely  Xyz Summon  to avoid the  effect damage  from "Overlay World", thus setting them up to be defeated by the  effect  of "Unformed Void".
