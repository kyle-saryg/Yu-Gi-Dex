 " Galaxy-Eyes " (ギャラクシーアイズ  Gyarakushīaizu  in Japan, written as 銀河眼 in the Japanese anime) is a sub- archetype  of the " Galaxy " archetype that is used by both  Kite Tenjo  and  Mizar  in the  Yu-Gi-Oh! ZEXAL  anime. They are also used in the  Yu-Gi-Oh! ARC-V  anime by Kite Tenjo's  alternate universe counterpart . All members of this sub-archetype are  LIGHT   monsters , except for the  DARK  " Number 95: Galaxy-Eyes Dark Matter Dragon ".
 It was first  supported  by the anime effect of " Galaxy Zero ", which was changed to support all " Photon " and "Galaxy" monsters in the  OCG / TCG , and then by the anime-only " Neutrino Dowsing " (which however works only with the Xyz Monsters) and " Tachyon Flare Wing ". With the release of  Primal Origin , the archetype received support in the  OCG , though the requirement of having 「銀河眼」 in the name was dropped.
 
 Story 
       The aura of " Galaxy-Eyes Photon Dragon " around  Kite Tenjo     
 " Number 62: Galaxy-Eyes Prime Photon Dragon " and " Number 107: Galaxy-Eyes Tachyon Dragon " share a connection with each other due to the fact that both dragons were created by the  Numeron Code . Also, the two evidently have a rivalry as seen during the Duels of Kite vs Mizar. Mizar characterizes that there is also a legend that the two "Galaxy-Eyes" monsters together would unlock untold power. These monsters are also able to manifest their powers outside of Duels, such as when "Number 107" and " Galaxy-Eyes Photon Dragon " caused an earthquake when they met or when " Number C107: Neo Galaxy-Eyes Tachyon Dragon " and " Neo Galaxy-Eyes Photon Dragon " almost destroyed the  Number ruins . [1] 
 When  Jinlon 's eyes glowed green for a moment, he saw the aura of "Galaxy-Eyes Photon Dragon" around  Kite Tenjo . [2]  There also exist "Neo Galaxy-Eyes" monsters which are the upgraded forms of these two dragons. They were both created with the use of energy from the  Barian World ; one was created when  Hart Tenjo  gave his brother the remainder of his powers, while the other was Summoned by " Rank-Up-Magic Barian's Force ". Kite later found a  tablet  at Jinlon's ruins which said "Dragons of light and time, clash at thy place of birth. Then shall the eyes of the galaxies truly awaken for the first time, opening the gate to a new world.", and he was certain this has to do something with how to use the Numeron Code. This was eventually proven to be true, as both are needed to unlock the Numeron Code.
