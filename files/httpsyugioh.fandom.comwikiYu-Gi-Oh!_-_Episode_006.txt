 Summary 
 Featured Duel: Joey Wheeler vs. Mai Valentine 
 
 This Duel uses  Duelist Kingdom  gameplay. Rules and  card effects  may differ from that of the  TCG / OCG . See the individual card articles for more information.     
 Monsters  compatible with  Mountain ,  Forest  or  Meadow  receive a 30%  Field Power Bonus . This includes  Beast ,  Beast-Warrior ,  Dragon ,  Insect ,  Plant ,  Thunder ,  Warrior  and  Winged Beast - Type  monsters.
 Turn 1: Joey 
 Joey   Normal Summons  " Masaki the Legendary Swordsman " (1100 → 1430/1100 → 1430) in  Attack Position .
 Turn 2: Mai 
 Mai  Normal Summons " Harpie Lady " (1300 → 1690/1400 → 1820) in Attack Position. "Harpie Lady"  attacks  "Masaki". "Masaki" then loses its Field Power Bonus since it is an  EARTH   monster  battling a  WIND  monster ("Masaki": 1430 → 1100/1430 → 1100). "Harpie Lady"  destroys  "Masaki" (Joey: 2000 → 1410  LP ). Mai then  Sets  a card.
 Turn 3: Joey 
Joey Normal Summons " Tiger Axe " (1300 → 1690/1100 → 1430) in Attack Position. "Tiger Axe" attacks "Harpie Lady". Because "Tiger Axe" is an EARTH monster battling a WIND monster, "Tiger Axe" loses its Field Power Bonus ("Tiger Axe": 1690 → 1300/1430 → 1100). "Harpie Lady" destroys "Tiger Axe" (Joey: 1410 → 1020 LP).
 Turn 4: Mai 
Mai draws. She then  Sets  a card (" Cyber Shield ").
 Turn 5: Joey 
Joey draws. He then Sets a monster.
 Turn 6: Mai 
Mai activates her face-down "Cyber Shield", equipping it to "Harpie Lady" and increasing its  ATK  and  DEF  by 500 ("Harpie Lady": 1690 → 2190/1820 → 2320). "Harpie Lady" attacks and destroys Joey's Set " Kojikocy " (1500 → 1950/1200 → 1560).
 Turn 7: Joey 
Joey draws. He then Normal Summons " Baby Dragon " (1200/700) in  Defense Position .
 Turn 8: Mai 
Mai activates her face-down " Elegant Egotist " to turn one "Harpie Lady" into three "Harpie Ladies" (1300 → 2190/1400 → 2320 for newly Summoned "Harpie Ladies") in Attack Position. None of Mai's monsters can attack during this turn due to "Elegant Egotist's"  effect .
 Turn 9: Joey 
Joey draws " Time Wizard " and subsequently Normal Summons it (500/400) in Attack Position. Joey then activates the effect of "Time Wizard" and succeeds at the effect. Since the effect of "Time Wizard" was activated successfully, "Baby Dragon" is turned into " Thousand Dragon " (2400/2000). Doing this also ages Mai's "Harpie Ladies", reducing their ATK to their  original value  ("Harpie Ladies": 2190 → 1300/2320). "Thousand Dragon" attacks and destroys all three "Harpie Ladies" (Mai: 2000 → 0 LP).
 
 Differences in adaptations 
 Some scenes that showed Mai's cleavage were edited to shorten her cleavage. 
 In the dub, Joey has used the  alternate artwork of Tiger Axe  instead of the original artwork. 
 Mai's "Cyber Shield" (Cyber Bondage) has spikes on the breastplate in the original. In the dub, the spikes are erased. 
 When Yami Yugi is telling Joey the phrase, a glowing eye is added to Yami Yugi's forehead in the dub. 
 The duplicate "Harpie Ladies" have spikes on their breastplates. The spikes are erased in the dub.
