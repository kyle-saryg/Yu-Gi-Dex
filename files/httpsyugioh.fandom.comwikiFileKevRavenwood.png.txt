 Biography 
 History 
 In the previous  Junior Arc League Championship , Kev defeated  Iggy Arlo  in the finals and became the Junior Youth Champion.
 
 Arc League Championship 
 Kev moved up to the Senior grade, defeating one of his opponents with his " Hierophant of Prophecy ." As Kev was a user of  Xyz Monsters , he was about to become  Celina 's next target. However,  Declan Akaba  anticipated this and decided to use Kev as bait to lure her in. The plan worked, and Declan told Kev to flee after congratulating him on his Duel. [2]  Kev was later seen among the other Top-8 of the Senior class, assigned by Declan to protect  Paradise City  from the imminent Fusion Duelists arriving from  Duel Academy . He expressed distaste at  Shay 's arrogance despite Shay being placed below them at the Junior Youth class. [1] 
 When the  Obelisk Force  started their invasion, Kev led the  Lancers  to fight the attackers. When a group of Obelisk Force members arrived at the Volcano Area to take Celina back, she,  Zuzu Boyle  and  Dennis McField  made their escape, leaving the Lancers to face the invaders. [3]  However, their numbers were slowly whittled down by the sadistic Duel Soldiers until only Kev and two of his comrades remained. Both of them were dispatched by the Obelisk Force's " Ancient Armageddon Gear " combo and Kev was next, but he was saved by  Yugo . Yugo proceeded to turn the effects of "Ancient Armageddon Gear" against the Obelisk Force and wipe them out. Yugo asked if Kev was okay, but the battle had gotten to Kev's head, and unable to handle the fight, he fled in fear without thanking his rescuer. [4] 
 
 Duel Academy 
 After  Z-ARC 's defeat and the  Standard Dimension  being reborn into the  "Pendulum Dimension" , Kev is seen watching  Yuya Sakaki 's Duel against  Jack Atlas  with his  LID  classmates. [5]  He applauded when Yuya won and watched Yuya and  Declan 's  Action Duel . [6]  He was happy when Yuya won the Duel and witnessed  Zuzu 's revival. [7]

 The only shown card in Kev's Deck is " Hierophant of Prophecy ".
