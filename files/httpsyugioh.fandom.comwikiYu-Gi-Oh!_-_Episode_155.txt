 Decisions 
 The episode opens with Yami Yugi and the others being unsure of what to do next: they suggest heading over to  Professor Hawkins ' house to talk with him. Kaiba and Mokuba storm off with the  Blue-Eyes White Dragon jet .
 Weevil  and  Rex , having found none of their speculated "Rare Cards" inside of Pegasus' private room are sure that the Professor must have some at his house, so they tag along the others. 
 Rafael's Schemes 
 In the meanwhile, Rafael is scolding Mai for her earlier behavior and for refusing to accept that she underestimated Joey. Enraged, Mai picks Valon's bike and runs off.
 Rafael tells Valon that they gotta deal with Yami Yugi and that he's already made arrangements.
 Professor Hawkins  is decoding the photos of the engravings in the deep-sea ruins and stumbles upon a name: 'Doma'. He wonders what it could mean.
 Returning from acquiring groceries with her horse "Billy",  Rebecca  sees an unmarked chopper land in front of her grandfather's house and some unidentified men taking him away before the house is blown up. 
 Rebecca's request 
 Hours later, the group has reached the place and discuss what to do. Rebecca takes Yugi apart and shows him a message recorded in a Duel Monsters Card and firmed by Rafael: he demands Yami Yugi to come alone to the Dead Valley. Yami Yugi decides to comply and tells Rebecca to keep it secret. He also asks of her for Gurimo's Orichalcos fragment: he seems to think (not explained) that it can help trace Rafael.
 Weevil and Rex, who'd been searching the ruins for "Rare Cards", overhear them and decide that it must be worth seeing. 
 Doma's Large Reach 
 Professor Hawkins  wakes up in a hut somewhere and Rafael comes in, introducing himself. The Professor is stranged that he mentioned that same name he'd been looking up: 'Doma'. Rafael politely asks of him to not get involved any further and that's why he incinerated his research lab. He then announces that the Professor is free to go back home: he knows Yami Yugi is on his way here.
 Within the mysterious temple, Dartz chants one of his spells and provokes a storm around the research ship, which is destroyed by gigantic waves, thus stopping any other chance to further research the ruins. 
 Double - Sided Race 
 Yami Yugi rushes towards the Dead Valley without noticing Weevil and Rex following using an old two-seater bicycle.
 Somewhere in the Dead Valley, Rafael looks at his Deck and claims that he and his Monsters shall defeat Yami Yugi. Two ghostly angel-like wings can be seen around him all of sudden: something is supporting him...
