 Summary 
   This summary is currently incomplete. 
 The manager of  Aster Phoenix ,  Sartorius , arrives at  Duel Academy . He tells  Dr. Crowler  and  Vice-Chancellor Bonaparte  that he wishes to explore the Academy by himself, as he wants to find students who he deems worthy to join the  Pro League  under his management. He meets  Chazz Princeton  in the woods while Chazz was looking for Jaden, and begins a Duel with him, promising to let Chazz become a Professional Duelist should he win. Sartorius lacks a  Duel Disk , and Duels using a table instead. Sartorius successfully defeats Chazz and in the process begins to play mind games with him. He persuades Chazz to join with him, promising that Chazz can use his power to defeat  Jaden Yuki . In this way, Chazz is brainwashed and becomes Sartorius' first recruit into the  Society of Light .  Ojama Yellow ,  Ojama Black  and  Ojama Green  try to save him, but Sartorius uses his powers to make the sprit go away. Jaden then takes a boat and leaves  Duel Academy  believing he needs to find answers. Sartorius leaves as well felling glad he got Chazz on his side. However he still wishes for Jaden to "see the light". The next morning Chazz returns to the  Slifer Red  dorm in a new white uniform. He tells  Bastion Misawa ,  Tyranno Hassleberry ,  Syrus Truesdale  and  Alexis Rhodes  how Duel Academy will soon be bleached white by the Society of light, much to the others confusion.
 
 Featured Duel: Chazz Princeton vs. Sartorius 
 Turn 1: Chazz 
Chazz draws " V-Tiger Jet " and subsequently Normal Summons it (1600/1800) in  Attack Position . He then  activates  " Frontline Base ". Now once during each of his Main Phases, Chazz can Special Summon a Level 4 or below Union Monster from his hand. Chazz then activates the effect of "Frontline Base" to  Special Summon  " W-Wing Catapult " (1300/1500) from his hand in Attack Position. He then  Removes  his two  monsters  from play in order to Special Summon " VW-Tiger Catapult " (2000/2100) in Attack Position. Chazz then  Sets  a card.
 Turn 2: Sartorious 
Sartorius draws. He then activates " Vision " to draw one card and reveal it to Chazz. The card is revealed to be " Arcana Force XII - The Hangman ". Chazz then must  shuffle  "Arcana Force XII - The Hangman" into Sartorius' Deck. If Sartorius plays the card he revealed, Chazz will take 1000 damage. Sartorius then activates " Suit of Sword X ", which rotates upon activation. It lands upright, so Chazz's "VW-Tiger Catapult" is destroyed. [Notes 1]  Sartorius then Normal Summons " Knight of Pentacles " (1000/1000) in  Defense Position . Since "Knight of Pentacles" was summoned, it begins to rotate. It lands upside down, so it cannot attack and if it is attacked, it will be destroyed at the end of the  Damage Step .
 Turn 3: Chazz 
Chazz draws " Graceful Charity " and subsequently activates it to draw three cards and  discard  two. Chazz then activates " Level Modulation " to allow Sartorius to draw two cards and allow Chazz himself to  Special Summon  " Armed Dragon LV7 " (2800/1000) from his  Graveyard  in Attack Position, ignoring the summoning conditions. Chazz then  Tributes  "Armed Dragon LV7" in order to Special Summon " Armed Dragon LV10 " (3000/1000) in Attack Position. 
 Chazz then activates his face-down " Ojama Trio " to Special Summon three " Ojama Tokens " to Sartorius' side of the  Field  in  Defense Position . Chazz then activates the effect of "Armed Dragon LV10" to send " Ojama Yellow " from his hand to the Graveyard and destroy all of Sartorius' monsters. Since all three Ojama Tokens have been destroyed, Sartorius takes 300 damage for each "Ojama Token" destroyed (Sartorius 4000 → 3700 → 3400 → 3100). "Armed Dragon LV10" attacks  directly  (Sartorius 3100 → 100).
 Turn 4: Sartorious 
Sartorius draws. He then activates " Selection of Fate " to force Chazz to randomly choose a card from Sartorius' hand. He chooses "The Hangman" who is subsequently Special Summoned (2200/2200) in Attack Position. The effect of "Vision" activates (Chazz 4000 → 3000). Since "The Hangman" was summoned, it begins to rotate. If it lands right-side up, Sartorius will be forced to destroy one of his own monsters and take damage equal to its ATK, however if it lands upside down, Sartorius can destroy one of Chazz's monsters and inflict damage to Chazz equal to its ATK. "The Hangman" lands upside down, so it gains the Tails effect. Sartorius then activates the Tails Effect of "The Hangman" to destroy "Armed Dragon LV10" (Chazz 3000 → 0).
 
 Differences in adaptations 
 In the dub, when Syrus and Hassleberry are in class talking about how they're sad about Jaden, Syrus yells at Hassleberry for copying him and how he and Jaden have a stronger bond than Jaden and Hassleberry. Hassleberry retorts by saying that if Syrus was really Jaden's best friend, he would be by Jaden's side supporting him, and leaves the class to find Jaden. In the original, Sho yells at Kenzan for being in a class that's exclusively meant for second year students when Kenzan is a first year, to which Kenzan leaves without argument due to having no reason to stay in the classroom if Judai isn't there. In addition, in the dub when Hassleberry and Bastion bump into each other, Hassleberry rudely tells Bastion to get out of his way, while in the original, Kenzan and Misawa both apologize to each other. 
 As  Chazz   shuffles   Sartorius '  Deck , the bottom card is " Monster Reincarnation " in the original. It is changed to " Monster Reborn " in the dub. 
 In the Dub, Sartorius already knew Chazz's name, while in the original Chazz told him his name before the duel started. 
 The Dub opens with a teacher taking attendance, while the original does not have any teacher talking.
