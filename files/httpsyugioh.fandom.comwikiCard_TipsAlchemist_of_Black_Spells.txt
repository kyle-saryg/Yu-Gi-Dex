 The effects of this card and " Apprentice Magician " are best used to place  Spell Counters  on cards that hold them that you can play on the same turn, those being " Arcane Barrier ", " Endymion's Lab ", " Magical Citadel of Endymion ", " Mythical Institution ", " Power of the Guardians ", "Spellbook Star Hall", " Magical Abductor ", " Magister of Endymion ", " Reflection of Endymion " and " Servant of Endymion " (the latter four being  Pendulum Monsters  that hold Spell Counters while played in the  Pendulum Zones ).
 Unlike "Apprentice Magician", this card can be equipped with "Power of the Guardians" then use its effect to place a Spell Counter on it, thus gaining 1000 ATK/DEF by the time it battles. 
 Traditional Format 
 This card can be searched by " Spellbook of Judgment " and " Last Will ".
