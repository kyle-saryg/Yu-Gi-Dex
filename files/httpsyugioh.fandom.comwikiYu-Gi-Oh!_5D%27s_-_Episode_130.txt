 Team 5D's  has finally beaten  Team Ragnarok  after an exhausting battle. With this result, the finals will be Team 5D's vs  Team New World . With the finals looming,  Carly  ponders while she writes up her special feature article about Team 5D's.
 While preforming the interview,  Akiza  and company accidentally reconfirm their bonds. In addition, when Carly talks to Akiza, they discuss the relation of their new opponents, Team New World, to the organization of  Iliaster  and the trio's schemes, causing Carly to gain unthinkable information. When Carly was finished typing all of the information down,  Stephanie  comes in with a teapot full of hot coffee. She trips on a wire and the coffee spills all over the computer, erasing all of the files and ruining Carly's report.
