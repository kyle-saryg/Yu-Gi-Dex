 Voice/Mannerisms 
 During its first appearance, Echo's only dialogue was to repeat the last thing that  Windy  has said, hence his name, though this was dropped in its later appearances. Windy uses Echo's "hand" as a pedestal, standing on it as other  Ignis  have been shown to stand in the  Duel Disks  of their partners.
 
 Biography 
 Windy  created Echo to substitute for his  human counterpart  and modified his code to create an illusion of " Paradox Hydradrive Atlas ", the monster that destroyed  Cyberse . He used the illusion to scare  Ai  and  Flame  when they came to the Wind world with their partners,  Playmaker  and  Soulburner . After doing so, Windy told Echo to resume his normal form. He did, and Windy proceeds to show his guests around while sitting on Echo's hand. Echo simply repeated everything that Windy said afterwards. [1] 
 Echo continued in this same role when Ai was lured into a meeting with Windy and  Lightning . [2]  Windy had created multiple copies of Echo and utilized the others as guards for his fake  Cyberse World . These guards would be Dueled and defeated by the  Knights of Hanoi . [3]
