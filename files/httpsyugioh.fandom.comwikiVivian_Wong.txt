 Appearance 
 Vivian wears a signature Chinese yellow dress and bracelets on her wrists. Red high heels adorned her bare feet and her hair is put in two buns.
 
 Personality 
 She is very whiny, hoping to get what she wants by obscure means. She is an avid fan of both  Yugi  and Kaiba to the point of obsession, especially Yugi, whom she hopes to turn into her "love slave", much to  Tea 's ire. She used her beautiful tactics and attacks to completely defeat her opponents.
 
 Biography 
 History 
 During the Asian Duel Monsters tournament, she defeated the supreme Clan of Nine Dragons and later gained "The Duel Queen of Asia" title. 
 
 Yu-Gi-Oh! 
 Grand Championship 
 To that point, she had a fierce rivalry with  Rebecca Hawkins  for Yugi's affections and had even gone so far as to blackmail Yugi into  dueling  her outside the contest, threatening to leave Yugi's  grandpa  with an injured back if he didn't accept. If she won, then Yugi would have to go on a date with her (become her "love slave" in the Japanese version); however, she lost all her  duels . 
 In the Japanese epilogue (Not shown in the English version), Vivian is seen with  Mai Kujaku  dueling against the  Meikyū Brothers  on the  Great Wall of China . Since Mai was not participating in the  Grand Championship , only briefly seen near the end, Vivian seemed to fill in her role as the "femme fatale" of that arc.
 Vivian was last seen in a cameo appearance eating noodles when  Maximillion Pegasus  was recounting on how everyone played an important part in  Pharaoh Atem 's journey.
 
 Deck 
 Vivian uses an  Asian-themed Martial Arts Deck , focused around her  ace , " Dragon Lady ",  supporting  it through an array of  Magic Cards . She generally uses  beatdown  and  burn  tactics through strong monsters like " Kung Fu Nyan Nyan " and cards such as " Mystic Eruption ".

 Trivia 
 Ironically enough, despite her reputation as a professional duelist, she lost all of her onscreen duels in the anime. 
 Vivian's personality and appearance is similar to that of  Meiling Li  from the anime  Cardcaptor Sakura ,  which is another anime involving cards. Her  Deck  also reflects Meiling's passion for fighting. 
 Vivian also resembles the female fighter Chun-Li from the  Street Fighter  franchise, similarly to  Street Fighter , who resembles the  SF  character Fei Long and was playing a game similar to it. Said character was named  Dragon  in the Toei anime and  Feng Long  in the  DDM  game. 
 In the second episode of  Yu-Gi-Oh! ARC-V , there is a girl in the crowd that resembles Vivian.
