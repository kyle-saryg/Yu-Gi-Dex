 " Duelist Kingdom ", known as " Let the Duels Start!! " in the Japanese version, is the eighth volume of the Japanese  Yu-Gi-Oh!  manga  and the first volume of the English  Yu-Gi-Oh! Duelist  manga.
 In this volume the plot shifted to focus more on the  Duel Monsters  card game.
 The Japanese version of this volume contains  Yu-Gi-Oh!  chapters 61 to 69. The English version contains  Yu-Gi-Oh!  chapters 60 to 69, but renumbers them  Yu-Gi-Oh! Duelist  chapters 1 to 10. Chapter 60, which was printed in the previous volume of the Japanese version, was the first chapter in the  Duel Monsters  centered universe. It was moved to this volume in the English version as it was better suited in  Yu-Gi-Oh! Duelist  than  Yu-Gi-Oh! .
