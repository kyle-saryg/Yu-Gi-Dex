Yuma Tsukumo 's Deck  is a Deck given to him by  his father  in the  Yu-Gi-Oh! ZEXAL  anime. [1]  His monsters have repetitive names like " Gagaga " and " Gogogo " and their effects often assist in  Xyz Summoning .
 In the beginning of the series, Yuma's Deck was very basic containing a random assortment of monsters with no central strategy tying them together. However, as he gathers the " Numbers ," Yuma's Deck slowly matures, especially after he receives cards from the  Duel Sanctuary .
 Yuma's primary strategy is the Summoning of his  ace card , " Number 39: Utopia ", which has a number of upgraded forms as well. He powers up this monster in a variety of ways, such as with " Double or Nothing! " or evolving it through  Chaos Xyz Evolution  and later, " Rank-Up-Magic " cards. Yuma occasionally uses other "Numbers", but "Utopia" remains his ace card throughout the series. His  Spell Cards  tend to focus on augmenting the  ATK  and effects of his monsters, while his  Trap Cards  like " Half Unbreak " and " Damage Diet " are usually more defensive in nature. As his opponents use Xyz Monsters themselves, Yuma plays a number of cards to specifically counter this as well, such as " Rainbow Kuriboh " and " Overlay Owl ".
 When Yuma's opponent is not wielding a "Number" or " Chaos Xyz " card themselves, Yuma often refrains from using his "Numbers". [2] [3] [4]  but is willing to Summon "Utopia" if the opponent demands it. [5]  In such situations, the " Djinn " Xyz Monsters or " Heroic Champion - Excalibur " are often his go-to choices.

 Yuma originally uses a  Number /Syllable Deck . It is supported with a lot of  ATK  increasing cards such as " Wonder Wand " and  Trap Cards  which protect his monsters from destruction such as " Bye Bye Damage ". It contains some support for his " Gagaga " monsters later on.
 This Deck was later replaced by a new version after Yuma received a large amount of new cards from  Roku  when he defeated  Kaze  and protected the  Duel Sanctuary .

 After saving the  Duel Sanctuary ,  Roku  gave Yuma the "Duel Sanctuary Legendary Deck", stating it is appropriate for him.  Bronk Stone  believes Yuma can improve his Deck with this one for the  World Duel Carnival . [7]  Yuma combined this secret Deck with his first one. [8]  He has also started adding  Xyz anti-support cards  to help fight against the "Numbers" and other Xyz Monsters. The Deck also appears to support Yuma's  Syllable   archetypes  more such as the " Gagaga " and " Gogogo " archetypes.

 For the  World Duel Carnival , Yuma further modified his Deck for the competition that he was about to face. [9]  This includes a large array of  anti-Xyz cards  such as " Overlay Owl " and " Muzurhythm the String Djinn " as Xyz Monsters are popular within the tournament as well as to collect the "Number"  archetype  easily. Like before, he largely relies on his "Syllable" archetypes such as "Gagaga" and "Gogogo", sporting new support and members for them alike such as " Chachaka Archer " and " Zubaba Buster ". In addition, Yuma has also added in a large amount of  Card Advantage  cards and monsters with effects that can be activated from the  Graveyard  or hand, such as " Tasuke Knight " and " Damage Mage " respectively. He reserves his ace card, " Number 39: Utopia " and its upgraded form " Number C39: Utopia Ray " for intense Duels against other  Number holders .

 In the finals of the World Duel Carnival, Yuma debuts more non-"Number" Xyz Monsters, " One-Eyed Skill Gainer " and " Gagaga Cowboy ". He also has a lot of Monsters that have effects whilst they are in the  Graveyard , like " Bacon Saver " and " Amarylease ". His WDC profile lists his Deck's name as  "Xyz One Turn Kill" [10] [11]  as he heavily focuses on using Xyz Monsters and normally wipes out all of his opponent's remaining Life Points in the final turn. In Duels with particularly dangerous "Number" holders, he relies heavily on augmenting his " Number C39: Utopia Ray " with the abilities of his " ZW - " monsters through the power of  ZEXAL .

 Yuma continues to use a  Syllable Deck , debuting new " Gagaga ", " Gogogo " and " Dododo " monsters, which he primarily uses to Summon " Number 39: Utopia " in various ways. He supports the cards with Spell and Trap Cards both new and old, including more  Counter Trap Cards . He later modifies this Deck before entering the  Friendship Games  hosted at his  school . He also makes more use of the vast quantity of " Number " cards that he has at his disposal, though he still favors " Number 39: Utopia ".
 After teaming up with  Ray Shadows  to defeat the  Barians , Yuma received a few cards of Barian origin to augment his Deck. This includes " Limited Barian's Force " which has the ability to upgrade his ace monster " Number 39: Utopia " into " Number C39: Utopia Ray V ", as well as  "V" archetype  to the new form of "Utopia" However in reality,  Vector , while posing as Ray, gave these cards to Yuma in order to gain an advantage in a Duel against him through cards such as " Vain Betrayer " and " Barian Explosion ".
 After fusing with Astral to form  ZEXAL II , Yuma used Shining Evolution to transform "Limited Barian's Force" into " Numeron Force ", which has the ability to upgrade "Number 39: Utopia" into " Number C39: Utopia Ray Victory ".

After acquiring the card from  Eliphas , he uses " Rank-Up-Magic Astral Force " to  Rank-Up  "Utopia" into " Number 39: Utopia Beyond ".

 After defeating  Nash ,  Astral  obtained all 100 "Numbers." As he and Yuma were Dueling over the fate of  Barian World , Astral naturally decided to keep the "Numbers" to himself during their Duel. Thus, Yuma modified his Deck before the Duel. [12]  The Deck focuses on " Gagaga " monsters and support. Like his other Decks, this Deck has a high amount of  Trap Cards . During the Duel, he would later get a new  Ace Monster  called " Number F0: Utopic Future ". [13]
