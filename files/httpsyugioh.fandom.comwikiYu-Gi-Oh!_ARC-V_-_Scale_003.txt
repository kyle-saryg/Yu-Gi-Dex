 The Hungry Assassin! 
 
 "Pendulum Summons!" , known as  "Pendulum Summon!"  in the Japanese version, is the third chapter of the  Yu-Gi-Oh! ARC-V  manga .
 This chapter was first printed in Japanese in the December 2015 issue of  V Jump , released on October 21, 2015, and in English in the October 26, 2015 issue of  Weekly Shonen Jump .
 " Phantom " finally reveals his true form in front of the  Leo Corporation  agents, shocking everyone with his  unique   Summoning  method and  tricks .
 
 Summary 
   This summary is currently incomplete. 
 Everyone is shocked to find  Yuto  has transformed into  Yuya  while accessing Leo Corp's  Solid Vision  system.  Reiji  warns his subordinates to quickly subdue Yuya while warning them not to underestimate the power he possesses. But  Shingo  is not impressed as he ignores Reiji's warning as he activates his Trap " Reawakening of the Emperor " to enable  Erebus the Underworld Monarch  to attack again. But Yuya uses the effect of Yuto's  Phantom Knights Tomb Shield  to negate Shingo's trap while placing " Odd-Eyes Persona Dragon " and " Odd-Eyes Mirage Dragon " on his  Pendulum Scale  to  Pendulum Summon  " Odd-Eyes Phantom Dragon ". After Shingo loses the duel once Erebus was destroyed in battle, Reiji orders his men to quickly capture Yuya at once. But Yuya expected such a move and placed a decoy to duel in his place. After obliging  Yuzu 's request for an autograph, Yuya makes his escape on a giant Solid Vision-based airplane. But Yuya finds that Yuzu stowed aboard, causing their ride to plummet into the bay. With Yuzu comes too, she finds herself in a place filled with water pipes and computing equipment: Yuya's hideout.
 
 Featured Duel: Yuto/Yuya Sakaki vs. Shingo Sawatari 
 Duel continues from the previous Scale . 
 Turn 4: Yuya 
 Yuya  gets an  Action Card .  Shingo   activates  his  face-down  " Reawakening of the Emperor " in an attempt to use the  effect  of his " Underworld Emperor Erebus " again, but Yuya activates the effect of " Phantom Knights Tomb Shield " in his  Graveyard , banishing it to negate the activation of Shingo's  Trap Card . Yuya activates " Odd-Eyes Persona Dragon " ( PS : 1) and " Odd-Eyes Mirage Dragon " (PS: 8) in his  Pendulum Zones . Yuya  Pendulum Summons  " Odd-Eyes Phantom Dragon " (2500/2000). He then activates the Action Cards, " Haunted Legend Pair Card 1 " and " Haunted Legend Pair Card 2 ", increasing the  ATK  of "Phantom Dragon" by a total of 400 ("Odd-Eyes Phantom Dragon": 2500 → 2900 ATK). "Phantom Dragon"  attacks  and  destroys  "Erebus" (Shingo: 1500 → 1400 LP), and its effect activates; since it inflicted  battle damage  the  turn  it was Pendulum Summoned, "Phantom Dragon" inflicts  damage  to Shingo equal to the combined ATK of "Mirage Dragon" and "Persona Dragon" in his Pendulum Zones (Shingo: 1400 → 0 LP).
