 This card can be searched by " Dogu ", " Single Purchase ", " Temple of the Kings ", " Number 29: Mannequin Cat ", " Rescue Ferret ", " Transmodify ", " Chaos Zone ", " Machina Armored Unit ", and " Qliphort Genius ". 
 Using this card in a " Kaiju " Deck with " Moon Mirror Shield " can easily dish out 4000-5000 damage every turn. 
 You can also improve it simply by using a good Equip Spell Card; even if this card only destroys a Level 4 monster, it will do 2000 damage to the opponent, which is significantly more burn damage than more commonly used cards such as " Elemental HERO Flame Wingman " can expect to do when destroying a Level 4 monster. 
 Cards like " Limiter Removal ", " Rush Recklessly ", " Shrink ", " Metalmorph " and " Rising Energy " all work well with this card. However, the 2 best cards to augment this card are " Riryoku " and " Prideful Roar " because they both allow it to kill any monster that can be destroyed by battle, regardless of its size. One works on your turn and the other works on your opponent's turn, an effective balance of offense and defense. 
 Use " Miracle Locus " to increase this card's ATK by 1000 and allow it to attack twice in one turn. This allows you to potentially destroy two monsters with less than 2700 ATK, as well as compensate for "Miracle Locus" preventing this card from inflicting battle damage.
