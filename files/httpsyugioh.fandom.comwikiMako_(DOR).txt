 Yu-Gi-Oh! The Duelists of the Roses 
 
 
 
 Mako  is the  Yu-Gi-Oh! The Duelists of the Roses  incarnation of  Mako Tsunami .
 If the player chooses to side with the White Roses, they meet Mako on the boat from Dover to the continent. Mako agrees to take the player to the continent if they can defeat him in a Duel.
 A player can obtain the card " Timeater ", using the  find  ability on E6, while playing against Mako.
 A glitch sometimes occurs. If the player's  Deck Cost  is higher than Mako's, the game will freeze. This is to do with the rule stating that the player cannot Duel someone whose Deck Cost is lower than theirs.
 
 Deck 
 Since Mako Duels at sea, nearly all his monsters get a power boost from the  sea terrain . He often fuses his monsters to summon " Aqua Dragon ", which turns any square it battles in into water, automatically ensuring it gets its 500  ATK  and  DEF  boost.
