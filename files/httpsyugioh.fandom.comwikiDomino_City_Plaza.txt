 Events 
 Participants of the  Battle City  tournament had to gather here shortly before the tournament began, so  Kaiba  could explain the rules.  Yugi Muto  defeated  Seeker  here in the first Duel of the tournament.
 Yugi Dueled  Jaden Yuki , who had been sent back in time at this plaza. Yugi was surprised to see that nobody else was around and Jaden realized that the clock wasn't moving. Jaden deduced that they were in a special place for just the two of them. [1] 
 When  Paradox  traveled back in time to kill  Maximillion Pegasus , Yugi, Jaden and  Yusei Fudo  Dueled  Paradox  here. [2]
