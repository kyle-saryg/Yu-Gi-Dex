 Appearance 
 Like all "Earthbound Immortals", "Uru" is a gigantic black, exaggerated animal with a secondary color; "Uru" is a spider with a red secondary color. "Uru" has a simplified and exaggerated head in comparison to a normal spider, with sideways-pinching, pincer-like mandibles, several short stalks protruding from the back of its head, and ten eyes in a lines of three and two on each side of its head. Its legs and abdomen have red lines running down them, and its joints are tipped with red spots. Despite its wide legspan and high stats in comparison to its fellow "Immortals", "Uru" is among the smallest of the "Immortals", though it is still a gigantic monster.
 
 Biography 
 History 
 Earthbound Immortal Uru was one of the  Earthbound Immortals  who participated in the battle with the  Crimson Dragon  5,000 years ago. As he was being sealed in the Netherworld, he dragged  Ancient Fairy Dragon  down with him. It is presumed that he serves  Red Nova .
 Uru's  Mark of the Shadows  resurfaced 5000 years later, choosing  Signer   Roman Goodwin  as its host. Roman's body became the first battleground between the forces of light and darkness as the Marks struggled to resist one another. Eventually, Roman severed his left arm, containing his Mark, and allowed Uru's Mark to influence him, destroying  Domino City  in  Zero Reverse .
 
 Fortune Cup 
 The first hints of the "Immortals" arises during  Yusei Fudo 's Duel with  Jack Atlas  during the finals of the  Fortune Cup ; the simultaneous Summoning of " Stardust Dragon " and " Red Dragon Archfiend " causes them to see a vision of Uru's geoglyph destroying  Satellite .
 
 Dark Signers 
 Uru made its first proper appearance during  Roman's  first Duel with  Yusei . Roman used the souls of the people of Satellite that had been captured with the  Black fog  to empower "Uru", and this almost took the souls of the watching  John  and  Mitch ; fortunately for the boys,  Jack  saved them. "Uru" was Summoned regardless, towering over the surrounding buildings as it faced off against the  Signer Dragon  " Stardust Dragon ". "Uru" later claimed the soul of  Martha  as she saved  Taka  from having his soul taken. After Yusei realized a weakness of the "Earthbound Immortals"; their inability to protect their player from a direct attack, and tried to attack Roman, Roman left the Duel, leaving  Rally Dawson  in control of "Uru". Rally proceeded to use the effect of "Uru" to aid him in  Synchro Summoning  " Turbo Booster Cannon ", which he used to destroy "Uru" in order to defeat himself.
 Roman swiftly Summoned "Uru" during his second Duel with Yusei at the  B.A.D.   Ener-D  Reactor, codenamed "Uru". "Uru" suspended itself above the Duel, impaling the walls with its limbs. Roman made constant use of "Uru's" presence to press Yusei back with "Earthbound Immortal" support cards, but Yusei was eventually able to defeat "Uru" with "Stardust Dragon" and " Battle Waltz ".
