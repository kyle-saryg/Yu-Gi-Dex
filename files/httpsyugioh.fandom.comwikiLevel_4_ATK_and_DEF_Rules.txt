 It has been suggested that this article be  renamed  to  Level 4 ATK and DEF conventions . ( discuss )     
       " Gene-Warped Warwolf ", one of the very few 2000 ATK Level 4 Normal Monsters to break the "Rule of 2000 ATK"     
 The ATK and DEF of a Level 4 or lower  monster  tend to be limited by two unwritten rules: the  "2000 ATK Rule"  and the  "2300 DEF Rule" . These rules state that for a Level 4 monster to have an  ATK  or  DEF  equal to or higher than these values, it must have some kind of  negative effect  or other restriction (such as being a  Nomi  monster). For example, " Meklord Emperor Wisel " is a Level 1 Monster Card that has 2500 ATK and DEF; however, it cannot be Normal Summoned or Set.

 Rule of 2000 ATK 
       " Meklord Emperor Wisel " is tied with " Giant Kozaky " to the highest  ATK  for a Level 4 or lower monster and has one of the highest DEF; however, it is difficult to Summon.     
 The "Rule of 2000 ATK" states that if a monster has 2000 or more ATK, it must have some  negative effect  or other restriction to limit its playability. For example, " Thunder King Rai-Oh " has 1900 ATK and is thus permitted to have a beneficial  card effect , but " Panther Warrior " and " Inspector Boarder " have 2000 ATK, and thus have the negative effects of requiring a  Tribute  in order to attack and a tough Summoning Condition/Continuous Effect, respectively.
 Several Level 4  Normal Monsters  have 2000 ATK, outclassing monsters with 2000 ATK and negative effects. They all have either 100 or 0 DEF. There are currently 10 such monsters: " Alexandrite Dragon ", " Gene-Warped Warwolf ", " Gunkan Suship Shari ", " Leotron ", " Megalosmasher X ", " Mekk-Knight Avram ", " Mystery Shell Dragon ", " Phantom Gryphon ", " Shiny Black "C" Squadder ", " Zombino ".

 Rule of 2300 DEF 
         " Gear Golem the Moving Fortress " has 2200 DEF and no negative effects.     
 The "Rule of 2300 DEF" states that if a monster has 2300 or more DEF, it must have some  negative effect  or other restriction. For example, " Gladiator Beast Hoplomus " and " Gear Golem the Moving Fortress " have 2100 and 2200 DEF respectively, and are allowed to have positive effects, while " Big Shield Gardna " has 2600 DEF and has the negative effect of being forced to switch to its weak  Attack Position  after being attacked.
 Currently, no cards in the  OCG / TCG  break this rule.
 There are currently  16  Level 4 or lower monsters with 2300 DEF or more in the  TCG / OCG .
