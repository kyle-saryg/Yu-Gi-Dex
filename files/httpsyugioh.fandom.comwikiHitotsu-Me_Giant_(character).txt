 Biography 
       An Hitotsu-Me Giant stalks an unsuspecting Téa as she wanders through the virtual canyon.     
 After being kidnapped by the  Big Five  and transported to the  Virtual World , Téa found herself separated from her friends and lost in a large desert-like canyon with large rock formations. Watching her progress from his holographic screens, Noah decided to create four virtual versions of the Hitotsu-Me Giant duel monster, arming them with stone axes and wooden clubs, and sending them after Tea as a means of providing him amusement.
 
       The Hitotsu-Me Giants surrounding Téa.     
 As Téa wandered deeper into the canyon, hoping to find her friends amidst the barren landscape, the  Hitotsu-Me Giants  stalked their unknowing prey from behind the large rock formations of the canyon. Believing that Tea was an animal for them to hunt, the giants readied their weapons as they prepared to attack her. Their presence was discovered however, when Tea spotted one of the giants watching her from a cliff. Upon realizing that it had been seen, the Hitotsu-Me Giant quickly jumped back behind the rocks before returning with the others revealing themselves, as well and surrounding a terrified Téa.
 
       The Hitotsu-Me Giants attacking Téa.     
 Though frightened by the monsters surrounding her, in an effort to escape, the nervous Téa attempted to walk back slowly without provoking them, before they could attack. Her plan ended in failure with her first step back however, as the bottom end tip of her platform-sandal ended up stepping on a loose pebble. Provoked by the sound this accident made, the Hitotsu-Me Giants roared in fury and began their attack.  
 One of the giants, the one she first spotted, began the attack by jumping high into the air from the cliff, before furiously throwing its large stone axe spinning towards Tea. Though the axe ended up missing and landing a few feet behind her, its impact on the desert ground sent out a barrage of sharp little rocks flying through the air towards Tea. One of the rocks ends up striking Tea’s face, leaving her with a small but bleeding cut on her left cheek, even though everything is supposed to be a virtual illusion (In the dub, Tea's blood was censored). 
 
         The Hitotsu-Me Giants chasing after a fleeing Téa.     
 Tea’s time to reflect on this mystery was cut short however, as the Hitotsu-Me Giants began continued their assault and started encroaching on her position. In the midst of this, Téa attempted to flee, calling out desperately for someone to Yugi to save her (for “someone” in the English Dub) but no one came as three of the giants chased after her. 
 
         A Hitotsu-Me Giant takes Tea by surprise and strikes her down with its claws.     
 Eventually, Tea’s path ends being blocked by the fourth giant, which had hidden itself behind one of the rock formations while its comrades drove her towards its position so that it could take her by surprise. Tea does indeed fall right into the trap and is taken completely by surprise by the hidden Hitotsu-Me Giant. With the Hitotsu-Me Giants towering several feet over her, Tea could only look up in horror as the beast menacingly starred down at her, before mercilessly striking the defenseless girl unconscious with a single swipe from its claws.
 Immediately after knocking her out, the presumed leader of the pack (the Hitotsu-Me Giant responsible for Téa’s cut) took the unconscious girl and tossed her over its shoulder, before beginning to march through the canyon with others following behind. Noah later briefly observed their march across the barren landscape, chuckling in amusement as the insensate Tea was being carried away by his savage creations (in the English dub he remarks with pleasure that Tea has “met” his Hitotsu-Me Giants).
 
         An Hitotsu-Me Giant brings Téa to the pack’s cave-lair.     
 Sometime later, the Hitotsu-Me Giants arrive at their cave-lair, where they intended on cooking and eating her. Upon arriving, the one that held onto Tea, tossed her down onto a large stone shelf overlooking the cave. Tea’s impact on the shelf’s stone surface caused her to moan in pain and her body to struggle in discomfort, while the Hitotsu-Me Giants overlooking her were visibly amused by her squirming.
 
         The Hitotsu-Me Giants readying to have Téa for dinner.     
 Tea eventually regained consciousness sometime later, but discovered that she trapped on the shelf while her cyclops kidnappers lurked at the bottom of the cave. The giants eventually readied a large pot filled boiling liquid which they planed on using to cook Tea into their dinner. However, after receiving aid from a Penguin, Téa managed to escape the pit, but with the giants hot on her tail upon noticing her climbing out. By the time they reached the outside of their cave, Tea had already run far ahead them, causing one of them to throw an axe at her, which, like before, just barely missed her.  
 
         The Hitotsu-Me Giants falling to their deaths in the river below.     
 The giants then chased after with the intention of recapturing her, driving her towards a large ravine over looking a river with a powerful current. With her only way across being to a rickety old rope-bridge, Tea began to cross but the giants followed after on it. With their combined weight having been too much for it to handle, the old bridge collapsed into two parts, with Tea holding onto the surviving handing portion of the bridge, while the Hitotsu-Me Giants fell to their deaths in the running river below.
 
 Trivia 
 Unlike their card versions, these virtual Hitotsu-Me Giants wear animal skin robes, and use wooden clubs and axes as weapons. 
 While there are usually only four giants seen, for a brief scene there were up to six of them in their cave.
