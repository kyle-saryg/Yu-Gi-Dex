 Biography 
       Sozoji's All Night Solo Live Show .     
 Yugi Mutou  recalled a negative testimony from three boys, whom he labeled "Mr. A," "Mr. B," and "Mr. C", to express universal condemnation of Sozoji's music. [1] 
 Sozoji forced Yugi and  Tomoya Hanasaki  to sell tickets to his  All Night Solo Live Show . When Yugi discovered that Hanasaki was also asked to sell tickets, he offered to take charge of selling all the tickets, so only one of them would have to suffer. Sozoji discovered the exchange and beat-up Hanasaki. [1] 
 
       The  silence game .     
 Yugi arrived at the show, not having sold any tickets. Sozoji then forced Yugi to listen to his music at a deafening volume and brought out Hanasaki, who was badly beaten, as the audience for the next act. [1] 
 Yugi switched to  Dark Yugi , who challenged Sozoji to a  Shadow Game  for making Yugi and Hanasaki suffer. The  silence game  consisted of two  Sound Pierrot  toys, which dance when they detect sound. These were placed at opposite ends of a table in front of each player. The first one to cause their toy to dance loses. Sozoji noticed Dark Yugi's headphone jack balancing on a glass of water, and he excitedly anticipates it to fall and make noise. However, the sound of his increasingly pounding heart was amplified by the microphone in his hand, causing his toy to dance. As his  Penalty Game , "Beat Festival", he was forced to listen to his deafening heartbeat. [1]
