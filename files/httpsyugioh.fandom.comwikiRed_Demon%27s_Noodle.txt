       The Red Demon's Noodle promotion.     
 Yusei ,  Jack ,  Crow  and  Bruno  failed to catch  Lazar  after witnessing him steal some  Oshiruko Noodles . In order to try and catch him again, Jack came up with the idea of a cup ramen promotion to lure him in. [1] 
 They came up with Red Demon's Noodle as a brand of cup ramen and decided to put on a show, where people could Duel against  Cup Ramen Man  to win a year's supply of Red Demon's Noodles. Crow lost a game of  jyanken , forcing him to play the role of Cup Ramen Man. [1] 
 Leo , dressed as a chili, and  Luna , dressed as a piece of  narutomaki , presented the event.  Akiza  dressed as a witch and Bruno wore sunglasses. Yusei and Jack hid backstage. Crow defeated many duelists before Lazar arrived in costume. The group surrounded him and trapped him in the giant cup from Crow's disguise. However, Lazar escaped after throwing a smoke bomb. Yusei threw a tracer onto him before he escaped, allowing them to track him down later on. [1] 
 
       Sherry slicing through the crates of Red Demon's Noodle.     
 A cup of Red Demon's Noodle was set before Lazar, when Team 5D's and  Sherry  questioned him on  Iliaster . Jack got mad when Lazar started eating them. Yusei convinced Jack to allow him to have them the sake of hearing the important information. After Lazar told a sad story of his family's history, Jack was so touched that he dropped a stack of crates of Red Demon's Noodle on the table for Lazar to take home to his family. Sherry sliced open and knocked over some of the crates when Lazar went off topic. When Jack became fed up with the little information Lazar was giving them, he started taking back the crates, unless Lazar gave them better information. [2]
