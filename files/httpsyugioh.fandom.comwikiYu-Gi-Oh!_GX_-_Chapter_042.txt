 A New Enemy...?! 
 
 "The End of the Battle...?!" , known as  "Conclusion! And...!?"  in the Japanese version, is the forty-second chapter of the  Yu-Gi-Oh! GX  manga . It was first printed in Japanese in the  V Jump  magazine and in English in the  Shonen Jump  magazine. Both of which were printed in  volume 6  of the  Yu-Gi-Oh! GX  graphic novels afterwards.
 Jaden  defeats  Reggie  with " Winged Kuriboh ".
 
 Summary 
 Jaden  continues his  Duel  with  Reggie , with the latter making a comeback by Summoning " The Splendid Venus " once more, this time using " Valhalla, Hall of the Fallen ". Jaden considers his options as far as  Fusion Monsters  goes and considers  Fusion Summoning  " Elemental Hero Gaia " with " Elemental Hero Knospe ", but ultimately Fusion Summons " Elemental Hero Great Tornado " instead. With this monster, he destroys "Venus", while " Winged Kuriboh " deals the finishing blow.
 
   This summary is currently incomplete. 
 Featured Duel: Jaden Yuki vs. Reggie MacKenzie 
 Duel continues from  the last chapter . 
 Turn 10: Reggie 
 Reggie 's  hand  contains " Angel Bow ", " Valhalla, Hall of the Fallen " and " Mystical Space Typhoon ". She  draws  " Heaven's Lost Property " and subsequently activates it, letting both players  draw  three cards and then  discard  two. Reggie draws " Divine Sanctuary ", " Angel's Ring " and " Shatiel ", while Jaden draws " Terra Firma Gravity ", " Pot of Greed " and " Hero's Bond ". Reggie discards "Angel Bow" and "Angel's Ring", while Jaden discards "Terra Firma Gravity" and "Hero's Bond".
 Reggie activates "Divine Sanctuary" and  Normal Summons  "Shatiel" (500/2000) in  Defense Position  without  tributing  due to the  effect  of "Divine Sanctuary". "Shatiel" gains 400  ATK  and  DEF  via its own  effect  ("Shatiel": 500 → 900/2000 → 2400). Reggie activates "Mystical Space Typhoon" to  destroy  her "Divine Sanctuary". She then  removes  "Divine Sanctuary" in her  Graveyard  from play to activate "Valhalla, Hall of the Fallen". Reggie uses the effect of "Valhalla" to  Special Summon  " The Splendid Venus " (2800/2400) from her Graveyard in  Attack Position . The effect of "Venus" activates, decreasing the ATK and DEF of Jaden's " Elemental Hero The Shining " and " Elemental Hero Stratos " by 500 ("The Shining": 3800 → 3300/2100 → 1600; "Stratos": 1800 → 1300/300 → 0). The effect of "Shatiel" increases the ATK and DEF of itself and "Venus" ("Shatiel": 900 → 1300/2400 → 2800; "Venus 3200 → 3600/1800 → 2200).
 Reggie attacks "Stratos" with "Venus", but Jaden activates his  face-down  " Defend Hero ", switching the  attack target  to "The Shining". "Venus" destroys "The Shining" (Jaden 500 → 200). Since "The Shining" was sent to the  Graveyard , its effect activates, allowing Jaden to return two " Elemental Heroes " that were  removed from play  back to his hand. He returns " Woodsman " and " Ocean ".
 Turn 11: Jaden 
Jaden draws " Weak Anger ". He then activates "Pot of Greed", drawing " Winged Kuriboh " and " Elemental Hero Lady Heat ". He then Normal Summons "Winged Kuriboh" (300/200) in Attack Position. He then activates " Polymerization ", fusing "Stratos" with "Lady Heat" in his hand to  Fusion Summon  " Elemental Hero Great Tornado " (2800/2200) in Attack Position. The effect of "Venus" decreases the ATK & DEF of "Great Tornado" by 500 ("Great Tornado": 2800 → 2300/2200 → 1700), while the effect of "Great Tornado" halves the ATK and DEF of both of Reggie's monsters ("Venus": 3600 → 1800/3200 → 1600; "Shatiel": 1300 → 650/2800 → 1400). "Great Tornado" attacks and destroys "Venus" (Reggie 1700 → 1200). The ATK and DEF of "Shatiel" decrease by 400 each via its own effect ("Shatiel": 650 → 250/1400 → 1000), while "Great Tornado" and "Winged Kuriboh" regain their  original ATK and DEF  as "Venus" is no longer on the  field  ("Great Tornado": 2300 → 2800/1700 → 2200; "Winged Kuriboh": 0 → 300/0 → 200). "Winged Kuriboh" attacks and destroys "Shatiel". At the same time, Jaden activates the  Quick-Play Spell Card  "Weak Anger" from his hand. This increases the ATK of the  Level  1 "Winged Kuriboh" by 1000 ("Winged Kuriboh": 300 → 1300/200) and deals damage to Reggie equal to its ATK points when it destroys a monster  by battle  (Reggie 1200 → 0).
