 Summary 
 Featured Duel: Yami Yugi vs. Mokuba Kaiba 
 Turn 1: Mokuba 
 Mokuba   Normal Summons   " Man-Eating Plant " (800/600) in  Attack Position .
 Turn 2: Yami Yugi 
 Yami Yugi  Normal Summons " Winged Dragon, Guardian of the Fortress " (1400/1200) in Attack Position. "Winged Dragon"  attacks  and  destroys  "Man-Eating Plant" (Mokuba: 2000 → 1400  LP ).
 Turn 3: Mokuba 
Mokuba draws. He then Normal Summons " Krokodilus " (1100/1200) in Attack Position. "Krokodilus" attacks "Winged Dragon". "Winged Dragon" destroys "Krokodilus" (Mokuba: 1400 → 1100 LP).
 The Duel is then prematurely ended at this point as Mokuba steals some of Yugi's  Star Chips  and runs off in an attempt to get Yugi disqualified.
 
 Differences in adaptations 
 The title on Pegasus' book "FUNNY RABBIT" is blacked out in the dub. 
 The whole sequence of Yami Yugi coming out of the Millennium Puzzle is added to the dub and a glowing eye is added to Yugi's forehead. 
 The scenes where Yugi and his friends rush to the dock and where Kaiba works on his Duel Disk are switched around. 
 Sounds and a visual effect of knocking is added to Kaiba's door in the dub; also, the scene where the goons burst in is cut. 
 The guns on Pegasus's henchmen are erased from the dub. Also scenes of them trying to shoot Kaiba are cut out. 
 A shot of waves crashing on the rocks is added to the US version. 
 In the 4Kids' dub version, Pegasus says that he's drinking fruit juice rather than wine. 
 The original Japanese version ends with a zoom-in on fake Kaiba; this doesn't happen in the dub. 
 Trivia 
 Next to the picture of  Cecelia , Pegasus has a picture of  Shadi . 
 First appearance of the Big Five, although they won't be properly introduced until the Virtual World arc ( A Virtual Nightmare ). 
 When speaking to the Duelist whose Star Chips had been stolen by Mokuba, the Duelist states he never got a chance to Duel, thus he would have had 2 Star Chips still; however, Mokuba somehow has 5 Star Chips when wagering them against Yugi; this suggests that Mokuba had also stolen Star Chips from other Duelists too. 
 In the dub, Pegasus plans for Kaiba to "have an accident", another dub death mention in season 1, as Pegasus is secretly intending Kaiba's death and Kaiba literally says die.
