 Yu-Gi-Oh! The Falsebound Kingdom , known in Japan as  Yu-Gi-Oh! Falsebound Kingdom  (遊戯王 フォルスバウンドキングダム ～虚構に閉ざされた王国), is the only Nintendo GameCube game in the  Yu-Gi-Oh!  series.
 Yu-Gi-Oh! The Falsebound Kingdom  takes a different direction from the rest of the series, being more of a mix of real-time strategy and RPG elements, with gameplay very similar to that of the  Ogre Battle  series than the typical card battling games seen on other systems.

 Gameplay 
 It features most of the major characters from the anime and manga series as well as 177 monsters. 
 At first the player can choose between two storylines, for Yugi Muto ( Yugi Mutou  in the English  Yu-Gi-Oh!  manga and Japanese versions) and  Seto Kaiba , but later the player can get one for Joey Wheeler ( Katsuya Jonouchi  in the English manga and Japanese versions) as well.
 
 Yugi Story 
 The Yugi storyline involves Yugi, as well as Joey, Tristan Taylor ( Hiroto Honda  in the English manga and Japanese versions), and Téa Gardner ( Anzu Mazaki  in the English manga and Japanese versions) being invited to the testing of the virtual reality game "Kingdom," created by the company SIC. When they enter the game they soon find themselves trapped within it, and they must summon the help of the game's characters and monsters in order to defeat the game's villain, Emperor Heishin, and ultimately stop the plans of the game's designer, Scott Irvine, to control the three  Egyptian God Cards . At one point in the Yugi storyline, some of your friends are brainwashed and you must fight them.

 Kaiba Story 
 Kaiba's storyline features  Seto Kaiba  and his brother  Mokuba Kaiba , who are also trapped in the game. Initially they work for  Emperor Haysheen  (Heishin), but Kaiba soon turns against the Empire. A climactic plot event in both stories occurs when  Mokuba  is kidnapped, and Scott forces Kaiba to battle against Yugi. At the end of both storylines is a segment taking place within a secret room leading from the game's fantasy environment to the inner workings of the computer that is running the game itself. Either team must defeat Scott Irvine as well as the enemy DarkNite, wielder of one of the God Cards ( Obelisk the Tormentor  (translated as  The God of the Obelisk  in the English manga) in Yugi's story,  Slifer the Sky Dragon  in Kaiba's). After beating one story, the other storyline becomes harder, with higher level monsters; this is probably due to the ability to carry over monster stats from one story to the next. In this harder mode there is an additional villain,  Nitemare , who has the God Card at level 99.

 This is the list of Duel Monsters featured in this game including the Fusion and Ritual Monsters in order of the Monster Selection. Where there are changes to the Real Life game, these will be listed. It should be noted that some monsters keep their OCG artwork even in the English version of the Game; therefore suggestive monsters, such as  Enchanting Mermaid  have not changed their appearance.
