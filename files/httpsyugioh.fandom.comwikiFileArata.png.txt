 Arata is a skinny boy with black hair and dark eyes with small pupils. He dresses in an abundance of hygienic and protective clothing; a clean white shirt with the sleeves rolled up and white pants, blue protective boots with white brushes strapped to the soles, blue finger-less rubber gloves over white ones, a black apron strapped around him with a blue belt with a white buckle, a white shower cap with a brim, and a black mask over his mouth and nose with the Japanese character for wash written on it. He also carries a number of cleaning supplies; three yellow wirebrushes tucked into his belt, a dishcloth tucked into the other side of his belt, and a red squirt gun connected to a water tank he carries on his back.
 
 Personality 
 Arata is a cowardly Duelist with little care for fair play, cheating in his Duels.
