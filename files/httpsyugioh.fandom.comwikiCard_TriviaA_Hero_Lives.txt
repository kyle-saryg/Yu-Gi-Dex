 " Elemental HERO Woodsman " appears in this card's artwork. 
 The effect of this card implies that its English name may have been mistranslated, as its original Japanese name 「ヒーローアライブ」  Hīrō Araibu  may be interpreted as either "Hero Arrive" or "Hero Alive". Presumably the former was the intended meaning, while the translators used the latter.
