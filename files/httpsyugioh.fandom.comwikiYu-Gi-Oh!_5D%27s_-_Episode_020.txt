 Summary 
 Stadium 
 Leo  is furious with  Luna  for forcing the game into a tie. Luna says that it's better than a loss and she wasn't going to win anyway at that rate. Luna notes that Leo seems to have no memory of talking to her in the Duel Monster Spirits World. She begins to wonder what  Frank  meant by  Signer . Looking down, she fingers her sleeve, considering checking her arm, where the  dragon birthmark  was showing.  Yanagi  asks if she's okay, while the others point out that she spaced out for a while during the Duel. She assures them she's fine.
 Yusei  tells the twins that he'll take them home today, shortly before the  MC  announces the end of day 1 and draws up the standings for the semi-finals. Leo's eyes fall on Yusei's next opponent,  Greiger , as he recalls his Duel with Greiger in the first round.  Tanner  says that Greiger shall be a formidable opponent. Yusei agrees. Since it's a  Turbo Duel , Tanner is interested in what kind of  Duel Runner  Greiger has. This catches Leo's attention. Leo figures knowing about Greiger's Duel Runner in advance might give Yusei the upper hand. Leo tells the others to go without him, that he's just remembered he has to do something.
 
 Loading bay 
 Blister  and a few others walk off a cargo ship into a harbor in  Satellite . A bald man walking off the ship hands a notepad to a man at the harbor, who checks it and tells them that they're loading recycling material tonight and asks if they can make it in time for departure. The bald man turns to the others coming off the ship and tells them to do what they like until then. A driver starts calling people over to his van to come this way to the Satellite black market. Blister joins the driver, who is familiar with him and sits in the back.
 
 Greiger's meeting 
       Jack punches at Greiger. This scene is removed in the dub.     
       Lazar giving a card to  Greiger .       Lazar  hands Greiger a card, telling him they've readied the card he spoke of. Greiger slides it into the Deck box strapped to his leg. Lazar mentions that it is a powerful card. Greiger has a chance of beating Yusei, if he masters that card, Lazar says.  Goodwin  explains that they are counting on him to awaken Yusei's qualifications as Signer. Greiger says that he understands and brings up the topic of when Goodwin's goal is reached. Goodwin continues his sentence that then  KaibaCorp  will provide the aid reconstruct Greiger's village. He asks Greiger how long he has been away from his village. Greiger promptly replies, 1 year and 116 days. In order to return ASAP, he plans to carry out his mission without fail.
 Greiger leaves the room. He is confronted by  Jack  in the hallway. Jack tells Greiger that he is in the way. Greiger turns to the side, sarcastically saying "Pardon my manners... King". Jack abruptly says that he meant, him as a whole is in the way. Jack continues that Yusei will advance in the tournament either way. Only he, himself, is capable of defeating Yusei. Greiger facing him is just a waste of time. Greiger tells Jack that he is a pathetic king. Swiftly Jack unsuccessfully punches at Greiger without any consideration. Greiger simply blocks the blow catching Jack's fist. Greiger continues that Jack hasn't even noticed his own mission. Jack asks "What mission?", but Greiger simply replies that he also has a mission, one which Jack cannot stop.
 
 Leo's infiltration 
       The face of Greiger's Duel Runner, that scares Leo.     
 Leo sneaks around a storage area. He comes to Greiger's garage and climbs in through the window. After turning on his flashlight, he is frightened upon seeing what he thinks is a ghost. His screams set off an alarm.
 Meanwhile Yusei is at  Tops  in the twin's apartment. He sits to dinner with Luna, who notes that Leo is late. Yusei gets up to search for Leo. Luna says that she's coming too. Yusei refuses, telling her that she needs rest. Luna assures him that she's fine, but she'll feel worse if she stays.
 Much later Greiger arrives at his garage, finding Leo asleep.
 
 
 Blister's mission 
         Blister finds the place in a mess.     
 The driver advises Blister to be on the look out for  Securities  as he leaves. Using an electronic tracer he finds his way to Yusei's friend's base. He calls out for  Rally ,  Nervin ,  Blitz  and  Tank , but the place is in a mess and no one was there.
 He contacts Yusei via the monitor on Yusei's Duel Runner. He informs him that he didn't find his friends, but he broke into their network and found no record of them being caught by Security, but he'll keep up his search.
 
 
 Back to Tops 
         Greiger returns Leo.     
 Greiger emerges from an alley, with Leo over his shoulder. He says he'll explain later, but not to worry Leo is not injured. Together they all go back to Tops.
 After Luna falls asleep, Yusei and Greiger step outside. Greiger explains that his security system must have went off, locking Leo inside. He deduces that Leo had come to find his Duel Runner. He lets Yusei know he is aware, Leo did not act under his instructions. Greiger explains that he would not blame Leo. He knows how fond he is of Yusei. Greiger relates, explaining how Leo and Luna remind him of his  brother  and  sister  back home.
 
         Greiger's sister  and  brother .     
 Greiger stares into the night sky, noting the lack of a single star. He turns to Yusei and asks him what he is fighting. Yusei prompty replies proudly that he is fighting for his hometown. Greiger informs him that they are both fighting for the same reason. Greiger begin to tell his story. He is from the other side of the world. His tribe descends from those who served the People of the Stars. Yusei points out that he must know of the  Crimson Dragon . Greiger continues that the Crimson Dragon is attempting to resurface and Goodwin plans using its power to lead the world in the right direction. Yusei asks if he believes that. Greiger reminds Yusei that they are both from poor towns and says that Goodwin promised to help his town if he co-operated. Yusei tries to convince him not to trust Goodwin. Slightly upset, Greiger says that they are cut from the same cloth, but they are in different positions. Neither of them can compromise their beliefs. Yusei's eyes tighten, before he announces that their Duel shall stand to that. Greiger leaves saying he is glad to have learned Yusei is a proud duelist, but vows that he will win tomorrow.
 
 Fortune Cup continues 
 The MC calls out the standings for today's first Duel. Yanagi looks around their seats and asks where Leo is. Luna informs him that Leo had something to tell Yusei.
 As Yusei prepares for the Duel, Leo comes over to him, apologizing for last night. Yusei understands, but orders Leo to apologize to Greiger after the Duel, regardless of whether he wins or loses. Leo promises, before Yusei leaves as he races out for his  Turbo Duel , introduced as "the Shooting Star of Satellite". The crowd's attitude to Yusei has now melted away as he finally receives cheers from them.
 
         The Duel Runners.     
 Next Greiger, "the Black Storm," speeds out of his tunnel, leaving the audience in awe at the size of his Duel Runner. Jack sits unstimulated by the Runner, but remarking on having a look at Greiger's "mission".
 The players line up. Greiger vows that he will win, but changes his words and announces that he must win! Greiger quickly Summons his ace monster " Flying Fortress SKY FIRE ". Stating to have Yusei frozen in place, he will win and carry out his mission.
