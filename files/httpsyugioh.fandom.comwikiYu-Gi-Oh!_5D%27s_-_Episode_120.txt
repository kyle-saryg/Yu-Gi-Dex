 Summary 
 Jack  has just  destroyed   Yoshizo 's " Hand-Holding Genie ", which had the pesky  effects  of blocking Yoshizo's other  Defense Position   monsters  from being  attacked  and gaining  DEF  equal to theirs. Without his main defense, Yoshizo is more frazzled than ever, but he continues his team's strategy of using the burn effect of " Speed World 2 " to at least deal some damage to Jack. However, Jack is ready for it this time, and he uses " Crimson Fire " to reflect double that amount of damage back, defeating Yoshizo with ease.
 Dejected, Yoshizo returns to the team's pit, sorry he couldn't hold on longer.  Taro  reassures him that this is how they're supposed to fight. He passes their beliefs to their next wheeler,  Jinbei , who races out to meet Jack for the next lap. The 5D's pit celebrates, saying Jack just has to keep up the pace.
 Indeed, Jack muses that Yoshizo wasted a lot of time with that defensive strategy, and he declares that he'll take Jinbei down in one shot. But to his frustration, Jinbei's first move is to summon another "Hand-Holding Genie", which instantly becomes stronger than Jack's " Red Dragon Archfiend ". Combined with the " Scrum Force " trap that Yoshizo left behind, Jack is once again faced with a defense that his dragon can't beat. The fans are enraged that  Team Taiyo  can't do better than this. Jack doesn't get how such a strategy is supposed to help them, but when he sees how focused Jinbei is, he wonders if there's more to it than this.
 Jack takes his next move, drawing " Shockwave ". The 5D's crew knows that Team Taiyo only has low- Level   Normal Monsters  in their Decks, and they wonder if they'll just keep using the same strategy the whole time. But  Yusei  knows that even though Taiyo can bear the attacks, that won't be enough to win. Still, he can tell that Taiyo didn't come here to lose, so he guesses there's an alternate strategy, but no one knows what it could be.
 Faced with the audience's jeers, Yoshizo feels like they hate Taiyo's Dueling style because the team is from the countryside, but Taro doesn't heed them — this is how they Duel, and they'll believe in that. Jinbei agrees, even though he thought otherwise back when they were building their Decks. At the time, he had stormed out, intending to go to the city and find better cards. But when he met up with folks from the city, they soon got into trouble, and Yoshizo saw how bad it can be when friends don't stick with each other. However, Taro and Yoshizo had followed him, and they rescued him, although it was a narrow escape. As they caught their breath, Taro explained something. He had realized their cards were like themselves — although the cards are common, if they believe in their friends, then the power they believe in can create miracles. With that in mind, he found a way to win that only they can do. As the sun rises over the trio, Taro gave the team its name, which represents a team that rises with a bright and intense light each day.
 Back in the present, Jinbei finally agrees with Taro — their team's Duel is to have a fighting chance. Jack tries to destroy "Scrum Force" with the effect of "Speed World 2" which gets Taro and Yoshizo worried, but Jinbei saves it with " Fake Trap ". This confirms in Jack's mind that they are trying to stall until they can complete an alternate strategy, and he decides that he has to end this as quickly as possible. To this end, he tries to finish the Duel in a  draw  by destroying his prized "Red Dragon Archfiend" to fuel the effect of "Shockwave", intending to leave the rest to  Crow 's swift attacking power. But to the frustration of the 5D's crew, Jinbei saves himself from losing by chaining " Gift of the Mystical Elf ". 
 Crow gripes that Jack always has to be hasty, but Yusei agrees that Taiyo is building up to something. The moment Jack returns to the pit, he warns Crow to not let them prolong the Duel.  Leo  passes Jack's one remaining  Trap Card  to Crow, who says he understands and drives off. Jinbei looks a little nervous, but Taro reassures him, knowing they only need a few more turns. Jack mutters that fifteen turns have already passed, and Yusei thinks about this while reflecting that Taiyo has done the same thing every turn.
 In fairly short order, Crow unleashes the full power of his " Blackwings ", destroying "Hand-Holding Genie" and defeating Jinbei with the attack of " Black-Winged Dragon ". Jinbei apologizes to Taro, but Taro reassures him that there are only three turns left, and their strategy will win it. Jack sees their cheer and comments that they still won't give up. Taro's move seems to be more of the same, and Crow blocks it easily, but Crow's boast is cut short when he sees that Taro is smiling. Taro  Sets  three cards, and he thinks that, on their next turn, he can use their strongest card.
 Right then, Yusei finally understands the strategy  Team Taiyo  is playing. To the surprise of the entire crew, he says that he now knows what card Taiyo's situation is building towards, and if that card appears, then Team 5D's stands a definite chance of losing.

Taro  Sets  three cards.
 Duel continues in the next episode . 
 
 Notes 
 At the start of the first  turns  for both  Jinbei  and  Crow , neither  Duelist  gained  Speed Counters , which is something that has never happened before. However, both those cases were preceded by a teammate losing the round during his own turn, which is also a new event for the  WRGP . It is possible that the WRGP has a rule that only lets Speed Counters increase when ownership of the turn switches to the opposite team.
 
 Errors 
 In the original broadcast of this episode,  Trudge  calls " Scrum Force " a  Continuous Spell Card  instead of a  Continuous Trap Card . This is fixed on the DVD version.
