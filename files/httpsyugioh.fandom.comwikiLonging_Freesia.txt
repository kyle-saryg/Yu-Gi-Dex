 Lyrics 
 Kanji Kana Romaji English 
 
 誰かが水をくれた 
それは簡単に虹を描いた 
理想通りの僕になるのは 
難しいね 
 
苦しみもなしに 
勝利はつかめないけれど 
咲いていたい 
 
かっこ悪い夢がある 
叶えるためなら 
笑われても構わない 
限界は自分が決めた甘えだからこそ 
明日へ乗り越えてみせる 
Ａｈ　青い空めがけて 
咲き誇るよ 
切望のフリージア 
 
数え切れない花びらを 
犠牲にしてきた 
その頭上に僕がいる 
Ａｈ　今日も迷いながら 
憧れるよ 
切望のフリージア
 
 
 
 だれかがみずをくれた 
それわかんたんににじをえがいた 
りそうどおりのぼくになるのは 
むずかしいね 
 
くるしみもなしに 
しょうりはつかめないけれど 
さいていたい 
 
かっこわるいゆめがある 
かなえるためなら 
わらわれてもかまわない 
げんかいはじぶんがきめたあまえだからこそ 
あすへのりこえてみせる 
アー　あおいそらめがけて 
さきほこるよ 
せつぼうのフリージア 
 
かぞえきれないはなびらを 
ぎせいにしてきた 
そのずじょうにぼくがいる 
アー　きょうもまよいながら 
あこがれるよ 
せつぼうのふれえしあ

 Someone gave me some water 
And I easily drew a rainbow with it 
It's hard to be like my ideals 
 
I can't grasp victory without pain 
But I want to blossom 
 
I have some silly dreams 
But to make them come true 
I don't care if I'm laughed at 
I decide my own limits 
I'll try to surmount tomorrow with this naivety 
Ah, aiming for the blue sky 
Bloom in glory, longing freesias 
 
Uncountable flower petals have been sacrificed 
I'll stand high in the sky 
If I admit my losses, would I be happier? 
Would that be rude to the me of tomorrow? 
Ah, even lost in doubt today 
I yearn for those longing freesias
