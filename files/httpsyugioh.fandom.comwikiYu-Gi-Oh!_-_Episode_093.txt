 Turn 2: Ishizu 
 Ishizu  draws " Keldo " and subsequently Normal Summons it (without even looking at it first) (1200/1600) in  Defense Position . She then  activates  " Michizure of Doom " to  discard  two cards from both duelists'  hands . Kaiba discards " Polymerization " and " Kaiser Glider " (Ishizu declares them without even looking at Kaiba's hand), while Ishizu discards " Revival Magic " and " Monster Reborn ". Ishizu's hand now contains "Mudora" and " Zolga ". Both players then draw two cards, though this was never mentioned or shown.

 Turn 4: Ishizu 
Ishizu draws " Exchange of the Spirit ". She then Normal Summons " Mudora " (1500/1800) in Attack Position. Ishizu then activates " Sword of Dogra ",  equipping  it to "Mudora" and increasing its  ATK  by 500 ("Mudora": 1500 → 2000/1800). "Mudora" attacks "Vorse Raider", but Kaiba activates his face-down " Shrink " to halve the ATK of "Vorse Raider" ("Vorse Raider" 1900 → 950/1200). "Mudora" destroys "Vorse Raider" (Kaiba 4000 → 2950), but Kaiba activates his face-down " Crush Card " to destroy every  monster  in Ishizu's hand,  Deck , and  field  with 1500 or more ATK; "Mudora" is destroyed.

 Differences in adaptations 
 Cut from the dub is a shot of  Joey  clenching his fist in anger at  Yami Marik . 
 Cut is a shot of the Duel tower rising when the Duel starts. 
 In the original, when Joey believed Ishizu's predicting powers to be a trick, he notes that it was was similar to his Duelist Kingdom Duel with  Mai Valentine . In the dub, he notes it was similar to his Duel with  Espa Roba . 
 In the dub, Kaiba calls " Virus Cannon " a  Magic Card , though it is shown as a  Trap Card . It was a Magic Card in the Japanese version. 
 Errors 
 When "Shrink" halves the ATK of "Vorse Raider", the latter's ATK is shown at 1950 instead of 1900 before it becomes 950.
