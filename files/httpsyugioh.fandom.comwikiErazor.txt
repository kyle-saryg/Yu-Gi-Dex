 Design 
 Appearance 
       Erazor's human form     
 In his human form, Erazor has a gray skin tone. He wears a brown sleeveless jacket, a pair of dark glasses, a necklace and black pants. He seems bald, but has something that slightly resembles hair on the back of his head.
 In his true form, Erazor is a tall bipedal, cicada-like humanoid with insect wings and a proboscis for a mouth. His skin is a hard brown exoskeleton with a red skull plate on his forehead.
 
 Personality 
 Erazor is shown to be an extremely laid-back, person, taking pleasure in draining the memories of his victims rather than doing his duties. He has a habit of pushing his glasses up his nose as well as licking his lips (the latter not present in the dub).
 He also tends to label his enemies, notably Yuma and Trey, as  gaki  (餓鬼, brat in Japanese).
 
 Abilities 
 As a  Barian , Erazor has the unique ability to devour peoples' memories, leaving his victims in a comatose state. Like the other members of his gang, he may also spawn a crest in the form of  Don Thousand's Emblem  during a Duel to steal half his opponents'  Life Points  and add it to his own.
 
 Etymology 
 Erazor's dub name is a corruption of "eraser", referring to his ability of stealing his victims' memories. His Japanese name, Semimaru, is based off of "semi", the Japanese word for cicada, alluding to his Deck and his true form.
 
 Biography 
 History 
 Erazor was a former underworld Dueling criminal who was associated with  Mr. Heartland . He was eventually reincarnated as a  Barian  and later assigned to aid Mr. Heartland in retrieving the Numbers. [1] 
 
 Yu-Gi-Oh! ZEXAL II 
         Erazor is defeated     
 Erazor and the other members of the  Fearsome Four of the Dark Dueling World  were summoned to  Earth  by  Don Thousand . Erazor began to attack other  Duelists  and steal their memories, including the  Super Secret Number Card Investigation Club , while  Mr. Heartland  lured  Yuma Tsukumo  to  their hideout . Heartland told Yuma that in exchange for the " Numbers ", he would restore the memories of his friends while erasing those relating to  Astral . Yuma refused, resulting in Heartland attacking him with a swarm of insects. After  Trey  saved Yuma from the attack, Erazor challenged both of them to a Duel. Before the Duel started, Heartland activated a device that halved Yuma's and Trey's  Life Points , while doubling Erazor's at the same time. [1]  Despite the large Life Point disadvantage, Yuma and Trey managed to defeat Erazor with a combination of " Number 6: Chronomaly Atlandis ", " Reservation Reward " and " Double or Nothing! ". After the Duel, he vanished, while his "Number" card was collected by Yuma and Trey. [2] 
 
 Deck 
 Erazor uses a  " Cicada " Deck , primarily focused on  swarm  and defensive tactics, centered around " Number 3: Cicada King ".
