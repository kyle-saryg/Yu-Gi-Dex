 Café Nom  ( Café Nagi  in the Japanese version) is a food truck owned by  Cal Kolter  in the  Yu-Gi-Oh! VRAINS  anime. Café Nom seems to mainly serve hotdogs. The truck has a sign labeled " Café Nom. Coffee Drink Hotdog " on the side of it which features a smiling hotdog with a canine nose. The sign can be retracted when the attendance window is closed. It also has a kitchen, several storage shelves, and a coffee machine. According to Kolter, Café Nom gets a large amount of customers at night. [1] 
 Café Nom also doubles as  Yusaku Fujiki  and Kolter's base of operations. The back of the truck has multiple computers which Yusaku and Kolter use for hacking, and a room which serves for Yusaku to go into and leave  LINK VRAINS  unnoticed. [1] [2]  A second room was later installed for  Theodore Hamilton  to use. Yusaku usually closes Café Nom when he and Kolter work on their hacking. [1]  There is also an emergency lever that can be used to shut off the truck's power.
 Yusaku occasionally works in the truck's kitchen when Kolter is away.
