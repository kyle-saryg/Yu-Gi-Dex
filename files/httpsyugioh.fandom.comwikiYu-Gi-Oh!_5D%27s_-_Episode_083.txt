 Summary 
 One night,  Jack Atlas  is suddenly arrested by  Sector Security  in relation to a series of incidents, which involve  a man who looks like Jack , riding a  Duel Runner  that looks like the  Phoenix Whirlwind . Jack pleads that he's innocent, while  Yusei  and the others are puzzled.
 While Jack is in prison, a small machine crawls to the lock on his cell and explodes, freeing Jack. He immediately fetches his Duel Runner so he can hunt down and expose the imposter. When they meet, the  other Jack  speaks as Jack did in his days as the King, boasting that he is the true Jack and that the other has lost his strength. 
 They  duel , and Jack  draws  " Trust Guardian ", a card he had drawn but not used in a practice run with  Crow  and Yusei. Crow had scolded him, saying the card was part of their team strategy, but Jack had insisted that he need not limit himself to such things. 
 In the same way, Jack does not use "Trust Guardian" but goes for a more destructive strategy instead. The enemy, unfazed and disappointed, goes on to  summon  a copy of " Red Dragon Archfiend ",  wiping out all of Jack's   Life Points  in one  turn . Jack is sent flying from the highway, devastated at such a manner of defeat. Yusei and Crow show up, only to find Imposter Jack riding away and leaving behind shards of broken glass.
 
 Featured Duel: Jack Atlas vs. Enemy 
 Turn 1: Enemy 
The  Enemy 's hand contains " Powerful Rebirth ", " Shockwave ", " Lineage of Destruction ", " Mad Archfiend ", and " Speed Spell - End of the Storm ". Enemy draws " Dark Resonator " and subsequently Normal Summons it ( 3/1300/300) in Defense Position. He then sets three cards.
 Turn 2: Jack 
 Jack   draws  " Trust Guardian ". During the Standby Phase, the effect of " Speed World 2 " activates (Enemy's SPC: 0 → 1; Jack's SPC: 0 → 1). Since the Enemy controls monsters, but Jack doesn't, Jack  Special Summons  " Vice Dragon " from his hand in Attack Position by halving its original ATK and DEF ( 5/2000 → 1000/2400 → 1200). Jack then  Normal Summons  " Dread Dragon " ( 2/1100/400) in Attack Position. Jack then tunes "Vice Dragon" with "Dread Dragon" in order to  Synchro Summon  " Exploder Dragonwing " ( 7/2400/1600) in Attack Position. 
 "Exploder Dragonwing" attacks "Dark Resonator", but the Enemy states that "Dark Resonator" can't be destroyed in battle once per turn. However, Jack activates the effect of "Exploder Dragonwing" to destroy "Dark Resonator" immediately without applying damage calculation and inflict  damage  to the Enemy equal to the ATK of "Dark Resonator" (Enemy 4000 → 2700). Jack sets a card.
 Turn 3: Enemy 
The Enemy draws " Crimson Fire ". During the Standby Phase, the effect of "Speed World 2" activates (Enemy's SPC: 1 → 2; Jack's SPC: 1 → 2). The Enemy activates his face-down "Shockwave" to destroy "Exploder Dragonwing" and inflict  damage  to both players equal to its  ATK  (Jack 4000 → 1600; Enemy 2700 → 300). The Enemy then  Normal Summons  "Mad Archfiend" ( 4/1800/0) in Attack Position. Jack activates his face-down "Powerful Rebirth" in order to revive "Dread Dragon" in Defense Position with its ATK and DEF increased by 100 and its Level increased by one ( 2 → 3/1100 → 1200/400 → 500).
 The Enemy activates his face-down "Powerful Rebirth" in order to revive "Dark Resonator" in Attack Position with its ATK and DEF increased by 100 and its Level increased by one ( 3 → 4/1300 → 1400/300 → 400). The Enemy then tunes "Mad Archfiend" with "Dark Resonator" in order to  Synchro Summon  " Red Dragon Archfiend " ( 8/3000/2000) in Attack Position. "Red Dragon Archfiend" attacks and destroys "Dread Dragon". Since the Enemy destroyed a Defense Position monster controlled by Jack this turn, the Enemy activates his face-down "Lineage of Destruction" in order to allow "Red Dragon Archfiend" to attack a second time. "Red Dragon Archfiend" then attacks directly (Jack 1600 → 0).
 
 Difference in adaptations 
 In the dub, the  Fake Jack Atlas  refers to himself as the champion instead of the king in the Japanese version. 
 In the dub, one random  Sector Security  officer is named "Biggs", and another officer later in the episode is named "Wedge". This is a reference to the original  Star Wars . 
 Errors 
         The arrow shows the cards aren't dubbed.     
 In the dub, when the fake Jack makes his first move in the duel, the card layout of all cards in his hand aren't dubbed.
