 Featured Duel: Marik Ishtar VS. Joey Wheeler - Part 2 
 Duel continues from previous episode. 
 Joey has 4000  Life Points  remaining and controls "Panther Warrior" (2000/1600) and "Rocket Warrior" (1500/1300) in Attack Position and one " Sheep Token " (0/0) in Defense Position.
 Yami Marik has 3300 Life Points remaining and controls "Drillago" (1600/1100), "Plasma Eel" (equipped to "Panther Warrior"), and one set card ("Dark Wall of Wind").
 Turn 6: Joey Wheeler 
At the End Phase, the  effect  of " Plasma Eel " activates, decreasing the ATK of " Panther Warrior " by 500 ("Panther Warrior": 2000 → 1500/1600).
 Turn 7: Yami Marik 
Yami Marik draws "Coffin Seller". He then  Sets  two cards.
 Turn 8: Joey Wheeler 
Joey draws " Insect Queen ". Joey's hand contains " Graceful Dice ", "Insect Queen", " Baby Dragon ", and " Foolish Burial ". Joey then  Normal Summons  "Baby Dragon" (1200/700) in  Defense Position . " Rocket Warrior "  attacks  " Drillago ". Due to the effect of "Rocket Warrior", it is not destroyed and Joey takes no Battle Damage. After damage calculation, "Drillago" loses 500 ATK until the end of the turn due to the final effect of "Rocket Warrior" ("Drillago": 1600 → 1100/1100). 
 Marik   activates  his face-down " Card of Last Will " to  draw  five cards since one of his monsters had lost ATK.  Marik's  hand contains "Legendary Fiend", " Premature Burial ", " Relieve Monster ", " Nightmare Mirror " and " The Winged Dragon of Ra ". 
 Joey  Tributes a "Sheep Token" to allow "Panther Warrior" to attack. "Panther Warrior" attacks and  destroys  "Drillago" ( Marik  3300 → 2900). Marik activates his face-down " Coffin Seller ". Now Joey will take 300 damage each time a  monster  is  sent  to his  Graveyard . At the end of the Battle Phase, the effect of " Helpoemer " activates, forcing Joey to  discard  "Insect Queen" ( Joey  4000 → 3700). At the End Phase, the effect of "Plasma Eel" activates ("Panther Warrior": 1500 → 1000/1600).
 Turn 9: Yami Marik 
Yami Marik draws "Nightmare Wheel". He then  Sets  a card. Yami Marik then  activates  "Premature Burial" to pay 800 Life Points ( Marik  2900 → 2100) and  Special Summon  "Drillago" from his  Graveyard  (1600/1100) in Attack Position. Yami Marik then  Tributes  "Drillago" in order to  Tribute Summon  " Legendary Fiend " (1500/1800) in Attack Position.
 Turn 10: Joey Wheeler 
Joey draws " Little-Winguard ".  Marik   activates  his face-down " Nightmare Wheel " and targets "Rocket Warrior" for its effect. Now "Rocket Warrior" is forbidden from attacking while "Nightmare Wheel" is face-up and during each of Yami Marik's Standby Phases, Joey will take 500 damage.  Joey   Normal Summons  "Little-Winguard" (1400/1800) in  Defense Position  and  switches  "Panther Warrior" to  Defense Position . At the End Phase, the  effect  of "Plasma Eel" activates ("Panther Warrior": 1000 → 500/1600).
 Turn 11: Yami Marik 
Yami Marik draws "Malevolent Catastrophe". On Yami Marik's Standby Phase, the effect of "Nightmare Wheel" activates ( Joey  3700 → 3200). At the same time, the  ATK  of "Legendary Fiend" increases by 700 due to its own effect ("Legendary Fiend": 1500 → 2200/1800). "Legendary Fiend"  attacks  &  destroys  "Little-Winguard" ( Joey  3200 → 2900). Yami Marik then  Sets  " Malevolent Catastrophe ".
 Turn 12: Joey Wheeler 
Joey draws " Question " and subsequently activates it. Yami Marik must now guess the first monster that went to Joey's Graveyard. If he is right, the monster is removed from play, but if he is wrong, the monster will be Special Summoned from Joey's Graveyard. Since  Marik  cannot guess correctly (The card at the bottom of  Joey 's  Graveyard  was  discarded  by the effect of "Helpoemer"), Joey is able to  Special Summon  " Jinzo " (2400/1500) from his  Graveyard  in Attack Position. Due to the effect of "Jinzo", all Trap Cards on the field are destroyed. With "Nightmare Wheel" destroyed, "Rocket Warrior" is released from its effect. 
 Joey then  switches  "Baby Dragon" and "Panther Warrior" to  Attack Position . "Jinzo"  attacks  and destroys "Legendary Fiend" ( Marik  2100 → 1900). "Baby Dragon" and "Rocket Warrior" attack directly, but Marik activates his face-down " Dark Wall of Wind " to prevent himself from taking any Battle Damage from direct attacks this turn. At the end of the Battle Phase, the effect of "Helpoemer" activates, forcing Joey to  discard  "Foolish Burial". At the End Phase, the effect of "Plasma Eel" activates ("Panther Warrior": 500 → 0/1600).
 Turn 13: Yami Marik 
Yami Marik draws "Lava Golem". He then  Tributes  "Jinzo" and "Baby Dragon" in order to  Special Summon  " Lava Golem " (3000/2500) to  Joey 's side of the  field  in Attack Position. Yami Marik then  Sets  a card.
 Duel continues next episode. 
 
 Changes to the English Dub 
 The face on " Premature Burial " is obscured from view in the Dub. 
 The cross on " Card of Last Will " is changed to a rounded gravestone in the dub. 
 " Little-Winguard " is redesigned in the dub. Also, its destruction is obscured. 
 During Marik's thoughts, "Legendary Fiend" is superimposed over him. 
 Mistakes 
 In the dub, "Foolish Burial" is seen with its Japanese artwork. 
 Also in the dub, a shot of Marik about to Set a card is re-added after he Sets it. 
 In the dub, Marik states that he has destroyed so many of Joey's monsters he can't remember what the first one was, but other than "Alligator's Sword", he's only destroyed "Little-Winguard" by this point. 
 Marik thinks that he'll destroy Joey with "Legendary Fiend", even though "Malevolent Catastrophe" will destroy all monsters on the field by then. 
 "Legendary Fiend" is shown as a Normal Monster. 
 Trivia 
 Up until this episode, "Little-Winguard" was called " Tiny Guardian ".
