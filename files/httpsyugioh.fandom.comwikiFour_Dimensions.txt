 In a world split into four dimensions,  four boys exist, all with the same face .  Their dragons  call to each other, almost as if seeking one another. 
 — The phrase recited before the Japanese  opening themes  for the  Yu-Gi-Oh! ARC-V  anime, during the  Heartland City arc . 
 
       The Four Dimensions. (Click on one of the dimensions to go to its page.)     
 In the  Yu-Gi-Oh! ARC-V  anime, the universe is composed of  four different dimensions , in which each inhabitant uses different  Extra Deck   Special Summon  methods. They consist of the  Fusion ,  Synchro ,  Xyz , and  Standard Dimensions . According to  Yuto , the Standard Dimension is in the center of the other three. [1]  While the populaces of the Fusion, Synchro and Xyz Dimensions use  Fusion ,  Synchro  and  Xyz Monsters  respectively, the Standard Dimension initially did not have its own unique Special Summon mechanic, with the other methods being taught to students at the  Leo Institute of Dueling . Recently, however, an  anomaly  gave birth to a new Summoning mechanic, the  Pendulum Summon . [2] 
 According to  Leo Akaba , the Four Dimensions were once a  United World . [3] 
 Each dimension has its own  dragon  used by  Yuya Sakaki  and his  counterparts  that represent their respective dimension's trademark Summoning mechanic, as well as a  bracelet  worn by  Zuzu Boyle  and her counterparts that are visually evocative of them.
