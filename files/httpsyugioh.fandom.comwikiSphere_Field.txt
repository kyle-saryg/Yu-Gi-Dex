 Versions 
 Astral's 
       A Sphere Field containing blank " Number " cards.     
 When  Yuma Tsukumo  opened the gate to the  Astral World , a miniature Sphere Field encasing the " Numbers " appeared, trapping Yuma. It then glowed and suddenly disappeared, hereby spreading the other fifty "Numbers" across the  Human World . [1] 
 
       Astral within a Sphere Field, recalling his memories.     
 Astral  can generate his own natural Sphere Field. [2]  Astral did so when recalling the memories he acquired from the fifty collected "Numbers" inside the  Emperor's Key . [2] 
 
 Mechanical 
         Dr. Faker's Sphere Field activated.     
 Dr. Faker  designed his own Sphere Field and began construction of it five years prior to the  World Duel Carnival , assisted by  Byron Arclight . [3]  Upon its completion, Faker used it to absorb the energy of the " Numbers ". It was utilized in combination with the powers of  Hart Tenjo  to attack the  Astral World . [4] 
 
         Sphere Field on top of  Duel Tower .     
 During the final match of World Duel Carnival, the Sphere Field was generated on top of the  Duel Tower  for the Duel between  Yuma  and  Vetrix , allowing Faker to gather more energy from the "Numbers" they use. It was treated as a  card , which allowed both players to  randomly   Xyz Summon  "Numbers" by using two monsters in their hands of the same  Level  as  Xyz Materials . [3]  Later on, after Yuma defeated Vetrix, it reacted and revealed its final effect which was to take away all the "Numbers" from their holder and to absorb the Duelists themselves once the Duel was concluded. Yuma used " ZW - Lightning Blade " to anchor himself and Vetrix in place to prevent this from happening, but Vetrix sacrificed himself to release the souls of his victims. The Sphere Field then teleported itself to the basement of  Heartland Tower . [5] 
 In the basement of Heartland Tower, the Sphere Field was plugged into the Sphere Field Cannon along with all "Numbers" collected from Yuma and Vetrix. Faker planned to use Hart to power the Sphere Field Cannon to destroy the Astral World with Yuma and Astral inside. After  Kite ,  Shark , and  Tori's  interference, Astral undid  ZEXAL  and ejected Yuma from the  Sphere Field in order to rescue Hart and the Astral World. When  Vector  possessed Dr. Faker, Hart disabled the Sphere Field Cannon letting Astral and Yuma  morph  and defeat Vector which destroyed the Sphere Field and Sphere Field Cannon.
 
 Sphere Field Cannon 
         The Sphere Field Cannon.     
 The  Sphere Field Cannon  (スフィア・フィールド砲  Sufia Fīrudo Hō ) is a machine created by Dr. Faker to destroy the  Astral World , located below  Heartland Tower . After the finals of the  World Duel Carnival  ended, the Sphere Field moved to the cannon, destroying Heartland Tower in the process. A slot within it allows for Hart to integrate with it, with his powers being used with the " Numbers " to power it, using Astral and Yuma as bullets to completely destroy the Astral World. It can launch trash directly into the Astral World via a portal. [6]  After the conclusion of the Duel between Yuma,  Shark  and  Kite  against Faker, the cannon was destroyed when the room collapsed. [7] 
 
 Sphere Cube 
         A Barian-produced Sphere Field     
 Main article:  Barian Sphere Cube 
 In order to acquire the " Numbers ",  Barians  developed Sphere Cubes which generate a red Sphere Field, allowing them to gather "Numbers" themselves.  Dumon  gave three of them to  Mizar , one for himself and two for  Girag  and  Alito . [2]  The Sphere Cube projects a Sphere Field in order for the Barians to  show  their true Barian form as they cannot show it in a low-energy world such as the Earth and such must retain their human form. [8] 
 
 Crest 
 Main article:  Crest § Bracelets 
         Crest's Sphere Field     
 With the bracelets developed by  Quinton , the  Arclight Family  are capable of creating a Sphere Field as Quinton and  Trey  did so when they combined the power of their bracelets. [9]  This Sphere Field appears to be similar to Astral's version, but was deployed with the intent of trapping  Dumon  and  Marin  within its confines to prevent them from pursuing Kite and Yuma.
