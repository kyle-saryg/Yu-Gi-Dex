 This card is generally inferior to " Cosmic Slicer Zer'oll " except for the fact that "Zer'oll" only puts monsters in Defense Position instead of outright preventing attacking. This means that "Zer'oll" cannot stop  Link Monsters  from attacking, and also allows  Defense Position attackers  to attack, since their ability to attack while in Defense Position is treated as a Continuous Effect. 
 Traditional Format 
 This card can be searched by " Last Will ".
