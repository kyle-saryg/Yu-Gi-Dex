 "Light vs. Dark!!"  is the thirtieth chapter of the  Yu-Gi-Oh! GX  manga . It was first printed in Japanese in  V Jump  magazine and in English in  Shonen Jump  magazine. Both of which were printed in  volume 4  of the  Yu-Gi-Oh! GX  graphic novels afterwards.
 
 Summary 
 The crowd is angry with  Jaden Yuki  for attempting to stop the duel between  Chazz Princeton  and  David Rabb , as they cannot see  what is really going on . Chazz gets to his feet, and tells Jaden to stand down, and Jaden begins to tell Chazz what David's motives are, with Chazz interrupting that he already knows - " Winged Kuriboh " and " Light and Darkness Dragon ". Knowing what David is after, Chazz will not turn his back on the duel, remembering his vow to get stronger alongside "Light and Darkness Dragon".  Midori Hibiki  attempts to speak, and black fog envelops her, and she's unable to. David tells Jaden that if he interferes any more, Midori's life will be at risk. Jaden backs down, Chazz vows to win. The duel resumes, with David's third "Quantity" attacking Chazz  directly  via the effect of " Long-Range Strike ". Chazz questions if the pain is an illusion, and David confirms it - the pain isn't actually real, but the Shadow Game induces hallucinations in the minds of the participants, causing them to believe they feel true pain. Essentially, fear is what is producing the pain. David looks forward to seeing what will happen when Chazz's  Life Points  hit zero.
 David's three "Quantities" can't be  destroyed by battle  due to " Indestructible Armor Plating ", but Chazz realizes that all three are still in  Attack Position , so any damage he causes would hit David's Life Points. Chazz  Summons  " Dynamite Dragon " and  activates  his  face-down  " Dragon Evolution ",  Tributing  " Genesis Dragon " to  Special Summon  the  Level  7 " Hurricane Dragon " from his hand. He activates its effect, which halves its attack points to 1100, but permits it to attack all monsters on David's  field . "Hurricane Dragon" attacks all three "Quantities", while "Dynamite Dragon" attacks one as well, and David is reduced to 1200 Life Points. David never expected to take that much damage, but states that the fear he's experiencing is the greatest pleasure he's ever felt. Chazz  Sets  two cards, calling David a "freak". David Tributes two "Quantities" to Summon " The Big Saturn " in Attack Position. He activates "Saturn's" effect,  paying  1000 Life Points and  discarding  a card a to increase "Saturn's" attack power by 1000 for the duration of the turn and change its form to "Saturn Final".
 David contemplates attacking "Dynamite Dragon" to deal more damage, but decides against it, as destroying it would decrease "Saturn's" attack points by 300 via the dragon's effect. He attacks "Hurricane Dragon" instead. As the dust from the attack clears, David switches "Quantity" to Defense Position, but sees that "Hurricane Dragon" is still standing. Chazz has activated his face-down " Staunch Defender ", switching the  target  of "Saturn's" attack to "Dynamite Dragon". Thus, "Saturn's" attack is reduced by 300, but Chazz now has only 200 Life Points remaining. David claims Chazz has now driven himself into a corner, but he replies that the same applies to David. Chazz activates his face-down " Dragon's Descent ", Special Summoning the last card in his hand - " Prairie Dragon ". David ends his turn, and "Saturn's" attack returns to its  original value , minus 300 due to "Dynamite Dragon". The duel is left up to Chazz's next draw, but he can sense "Light and Darkness Dragon". He is correct, and Tributes "Hurricane Dragon" and "Prairie Dragon" to Summon it. The shadow can sense the  Feather of Ma'at , and leaves David's body, appearing to be afraid of it. Chazz attacks, and David is defeated.
