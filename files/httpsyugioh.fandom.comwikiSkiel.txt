 "Skiel"  (スキエル  Sukieru ) is an  archetype  used by  Lester  in  Yu-Gi-Oh! 5D's . Just like " Wisel " and " Granel ", all its five parts were  Special Summoned  by its  core , and all parts function as one monster. Rather than being  DARK  attribute monsters like those of "Wisel", its parts were  WIND . The parts themselves resemble birds and other flying creatures.
 All of them are Level 1, WIND, and  Machine - Type , with the exception of " Skiel Attack 3 " and " Skiel Carrier 5 " who are level 3 and level 5, respectively. There are 5 basic parts but there is also 1 called " Sky Core ", which  Special Summons  all of them to the  field  when it's sent to the  Graveyard  by a  card effect . 
 Between episodes  106  and  107 ,  Primo  stole " Skiel Carrier 3 " and " Skiel Carrier 5 " from Lester to use in his duel against  Yusei .
 Skiel functions not that much differently than  Wisel ; quickly  destroy  " Sky Core " with a card effect, then use the main body part to absorb the opponent's  Synchro Monsters , while at the same time upgrading the parts to give Skiel better  offense  and  defense . Unlike the other two "Meklords", "Skiel" if upgraded can bypass the opponents monsters and attack directly (the OCG Skiel has to sacrifice the Synchro monster equipped in order to attack directly). Like the other Meklords, there is a real-life version of this card that is only one monster and not 5.
 These cards are all available in  Yu-Gi-Oh! 5D's Tag Force 5  (as the single part was not released at this time), though a few minor changes were made (i.e. the main body doesn't prevent the other cards from attacking). They continued to appear in  Tag Force 6 , though in order to make the parts function with the OCG/TCG cards, the lore now only refers to "Meklord Emperors"; not Infinity Monsters.
