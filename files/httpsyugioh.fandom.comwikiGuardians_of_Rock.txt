 Description  
 Magnet Warriors  and  Triamids ! Nothing can get past these defenders of stone! 
 
 Featuring: 
" Berserkion the Electromagna Warrior ", TYou can Special Summon this monster by banishing 1 " Alpha The Electromagnet Warrior ," " Beta The Electromagnet Warrior ," and " Gamma The Electromagnet Warrior " from your hand, field or Graveyard! In addition, you can banish 1 " Magnet Warrior " monster from your Graveyard to destroy 1 card your opponent controls! This effect isn't once per turn, so as long as you have "Magnet Warrior" monsters in the Graveyard, you can destroy as many cards as you want! 
" Debris Dragon ", When this Tuner monster is Normal Summoned, you can Special Summon a monster with 500 ATK or less from your Graveyard. Special Summon a non-Tuner Level 3 monster to Synchro Summon " Ancient Fairy Dragon " or " Black Rose Dragon "! 
" Magician Navigation ", This Trap Card lets you Special Summon 1 " Dark Magician " from your hand, and then you can Special Summon 1 Level 7 DARK  Spellcaster -Type monster from your Deck. In addition, if you control a "Dark Magician," you can banish this card from your Graveyard to negate a Spell/Trap Card your opponent controls until the end of the turn. 
" Triamid Master ", This monster lets you send 1 " Triamid " card to the Graveyard to destroy 1 Set card. "Triamid" Field Spell Cards have effects that activate when they are sent to the Graveyard, so this card works great with them!
