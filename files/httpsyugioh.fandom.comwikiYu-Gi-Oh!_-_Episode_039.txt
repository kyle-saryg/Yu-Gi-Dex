 Summary 
 Yami Yugi  is on the verge of defeat against  Pegasus .  He then gets a vision of  Solomon Muto , who tells him that  Yugi  may not physically be with him, but his spirit still is. When Pegasus tries to read Yugi's mind, the card he  drew  is blocked because of  Téa ,  Tristan  and  Joey  spiritually bonding together to support Yami Yugi.
 Yami Yugi wins the duel with the help of " Magician of Black Chaos ". Pegasus is left completely shocked at his loss. Yugi is revived and the  shadow  bubble dissipates away.  
 Yugi's friends are overjoyed that he is okay and that he finally won the Duel, but Téa quickly reminds everyone that this is not over yet until Pegasus returns  Kaiba ,  Mokuba , and Yugi's grandfather's souls like he promised. Yugi then turns around and is shocked to see that Pegasus has disappeared.  Bakura  at this point wakes up and calls out to the group. Tristan reveals to Bakura that he had to get rid of the  Millennium Ring  as it was possessing him like before and Bakura understands that getting rid of it was the probably the right thing to do. Bakura then tells the group he'll keep an eye on Mokuba while the others search for Pegasus. 
 After they leave, the Millennium Ring reappears around his neck and  Yami Bakura  returns. Mokuba's body is no longer of use to Yami Bakura since Pegasus will be returning his soul, but with Pegasus weakened, Yami Bakura states it is the perfect time to take his Millennium Eye.
 
 Featured Duel: Yami Yugi vs. Maximillion Pegasus 
 
 This Duel uses  Duelist Kingdom  gameplay. Rules and  card effects  may differ from that of the  TCG / OCG . See the individual card articles for more information.     
 Duel continues from the previous episode . 
 Yami Yugi  has 400  LP  remaining and  controls  no  monsters  and 1  Set  card. 
 Pegasus  has 600 LP remaining and controls " Jigen Bakudan " (200/1000) and " Relinquished "  equipped  with " Dark Magician " (2500/2100) both in  Attack Position  and no Set cards.
 Turn 33: Yami Yugi 
Yami Yugi is encouraged to win by  Yugi 's  grandfather   and   his   friends . Yami Yugi  draws  " Mystic Box ". Pegasus tries to read his mind in order to see what card Yami Yugi drew, but due to Yami Yugi's friends supporting him, Pegasus's  Millennium Eye  is blocked. Yami Yugi  activates  "Mystic Box" to make his "Dark Magician" and Pegasus's "Jigen Bakudan" swap places. This frees Dark Magician and places it back on Yami Yugi's side of the  field  (2500/2100) in Attack Position while "Jigen Bakudan" becomes the  Equip Card  for "Relinquished" ("Relinquished": 2500 → 200/2100 → 1000). During Yami Yugi's next  End Phase , "Jigen Bakudan" will self-destruct and  destroy  "Relinquished".
 Turn 34: Pegasus 
Pegasus draws, then passes his  turn .
 Turn 35: Yami Yugi 
Yami Yugi draws " Brain Control " and subsequently activates it to take control of "Relinquished" until the End Phase. He then activates his face-down " Dark Magic Ritual " to  Tribute  "Dark Magician" and "Jigen Bakudan" ("Relinquished": 200 → 0/1000 → 0) and  Ritual Summon  " Magician of Black Chaos " (2800/2600) in Attack Position. Yami Yugi then  Sets  a card and a monster. On Yami Yugi's End Phase, "Relinquished" returns to Pegasus's side of the field.
 Turn 36: Pegasus 
Pegasus draws. He  Normal Summons  " Thousand-Eyes Idol " (0/0) in Attack Position. He then activates " Polymerization " to  fuse  "Relinquished" with "Thousand-Eyes Idol" and  Fusion Summon  " Thousand-Eyes Restrict " (0/0) in Attack Position. Due to the  effect  of "Thousand-Eyes Restrict", none of Yami Yugi's monsters can  attack  or  change  their  battle positions . 
 Pegasus then tries to activate the effect of "Thousand-Eyes Restrict" to equip "Magician of Black Chaos" to "Thousand-Eyes Restrict", but Yami Yugi reveals his Set " Kuriboh " (300/200) and activates his face-down " Multiply " to make "Thousand-Eyes Restrict"  target  "Kuriboh" instead. The effect of "Kuriboh" then activates, destroying itself to  negate  the effects of "Thousand-Eyes Restrict" and inflict 300  damage  to Yami Yugi ("Thousand-Eyes Restrict": 0 → 300/0 → 200) (Yami Yugi: 400 → 100 LP).
 Turn 37: Yami Yugi 
Yami Yugi draws. "Magician of Black Chaos" attacks and destroys "Thousand-Eyes Restrict" (Pegasus: 600 → 0 LP).
 
 Trivia 
 When Thousand-Eyes Restrict absorbs Kuriboh, the DEF of Thousand-Eyes Restrict is shown as 0 instead of Kuriboh's DEF of 200. 
 When Yugi's friends are blocking Pegasus from seeing Yami Yugi's "Mystic Box", if you look closely, you can actually see the artwork for "Mystic Box" on the card behind them. 
 Starting from this episode and onward, the animation uses different kind of coloration and added glare to the characters skin tone. 
 Differences in adaptations 
 The artworks of " Mystic Box ", " Dark Magic Ritual " and " Brain Control " are slightly redesigned in the dub. 
 When Pegasus drops his cards when he loses, " Killer Needle " is replaced by " Laser Cannon Armor " in the dub. 
 The five-pointed star from " Magician of Black Chaos 's" headpiece is removed. 
 The dub makes Yami Yugi appear to not know that the last card Yugi played was "Dark Magic Ritual". However, as Yami Yugi had faith in Yugi, this would foreshadow his "Brain Control" strategy will help.
