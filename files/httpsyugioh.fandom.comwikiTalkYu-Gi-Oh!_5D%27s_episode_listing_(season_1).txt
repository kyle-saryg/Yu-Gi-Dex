 If you have content to add, you can't directy add it to this page. You need to create the episode page first. This page automatically updates itself using data that's been entered in the episode pages. --  Deltaneos  ( talk ) 17:24, 13 August 2008 (UTC) 
 Season 2 
 From eps 1-26 is first season
From 27 is the second.
Should we make a Second Season page?  Diehard Guy  12:00, 5 October 2008 (UTC)
 
 I'm not sure 27 onwards in season 2. It could just be the next story arc. If you compare to Yu-Gi-Oh! GX, seasons 1 to 3 each consisted of two story arcs. Season 1 was split into two arcs: episodes 1 to 26 were  Freshman Year  and 27 to 52 were  Rise of the Sacred Beasts . In Yu-Gi-Oh! 5D's, it could be that episodes 1 to 26 are  Fortune Cup  and 27 onwards is Dark Signers. --  Deltaneos  ( talk ) 12:33, 5 October 2008 (UTC) 
 There are lots of sources on the Internet, including Wikipedia, that say that season two begins with episode 27. In fact, this site seems to be the only source that disagrees. As a matter of fact, since a new episode typically airs on the same day every week, and a new season typically begins every year, it doesn't really make sense to have a season that is 64 episodes long. That's why the Yu-Gi-Oh! GX seasons worked out so well, because there are 52 weeks in a year.  RedDrgn  ( talk  •  contribs ) 16:58, July 10, 2011 (UTC) 
 This section is nearly three years old. Episode 27 had only just aired when it started. There have been other discussions since... 
 The 4Kids website is the only place that's officially said where seasons begin and end and it lists episodes 1 to 64 as season 1. Their seasons for  Yu-Gi-Oh!  and  Yu-Gi-Oh! GX  also match what we've done. Any sites I've seen do it differently are written by fans and use what they've assumed to be the beginning and end of seasons. --  Deltaneos  ( talk ) 22:45, July 10, 2011 (UTC) 
 The Yu-Gi-Oh 5D episodes are missing 
 Hi, I just want to tell you that the episodes of Yu-Gi-Oh 5D on the Yu-Gi-Oh 5d episode listing are been removed sohehow. I hope this problem will soon be solved. Thanks.

 Order problem 
 Epsiode 35 is after 37. Plz someone fix this.  Diehard Guy  13:52, 10 November 2008 (UTC)
 
 The pages were sorted alphabetically rather than by number. Someone left out the hyphen in the episode 35 pagename, causing it to go to the bottom. Anyway  |sort=Episode number  should make sure they're sorted by number rather than pagename now. --  Deltaneos  ( talk ) 14:15, 10 November 2008 (UTC) 
 Series Ending 
 I wonder how long the series is gonna be? Iz it gonna follow Gx and have the season end at 52, or will they just keep on going?-- Mr.Archfreak  02:28, 3 February 2009 (UTC)
 More episodes to go after and there's not any mentioning of an ending right now of this current season that is or at least for now there no info abot the subject.  DracoX  03:18, 15 February 2009 (UTC)

 Spilting series two 
 I think series two needs to be split in to more section than just Dark Signers, i would do it myslef but i will just end up mucking it up.

So from episodes 27 - 29 they should be Enter the Dark Signers, which i have just changed
Episodes 30-35 Return to Satellite,     Episodes 36-39 Back in Neo Domino,       Episodes 40 + SINGERS UNITE
            
Some one please to this, i don't want to force myslef into a position where i do it myslef  —This unsigned comment was made by  Scorchgid  ( talk  •  contribs ) 23:33, 12 February 2009 (UTC) 
 
 Hmmm. I'm not so sure. A story arc surely shouldn't start with the phrase "Back in". Fortune Cup is clearly split-up as its divided into 3 mini-arcs. Dark Signers seems more continuous the whole way through. If it was to be split I'd say 27 to 35, 36 to 44 and 45 onwards and I'm not sure what to call them. --  Deltaneos  ( talk ) 00:43, 16 February 2009 (UTC) 
 Well yes but Kiryu is kind of a big plot twist, and if didn't feel like it belonged at the beginning, but your right about the fact that it shouldn't be “back in neo domino”, but I am not sure what else to call it. Possible... wait I got it, Acadia movement, its the only time we will see them so it will work, but return to satellite is fitting as it is when Yuise first returns to it after he left in EP 3. This series is about the dark Siners, but the series is slip into several parts. You don't call series one called “Rise of the Siners”.  —This unsigned comment was made by  Scorchgid  ( talk  •  contribs ) 14:03, 16 February 2009 (UTC) 
 Maybe it's best we just have it split into 2: Fortune Cup and Dark Signers, since they're the only parts where it's officially split. --  Deltaneos  ( talk ) 00:29, 8 March 2009 (UTC)
 
 2008 00:00:00 
 What does 2008 00:00:00 mean? For instance, the air date for Episode 6-8. Why is the air date 2008 00:00:00? Shouldn't it be May 7/14/21 2008?  —This unsigned comment was made by  Dark Pride  ( talk  •  contribs ) 10:50, 13 February 2009 (UTC) 
 
 It's because we use an extension called Semmanitc MediaWiki to draw up this list. We recently got upgraded to a newer version, which made some changes to dates. To do that it reset the cache for all stored dates. So everything has been reset to  2008 00:00:00 . If an edit is made to the episode pages, it will overwrite the cache and fix this. --  Deltaneos  ( talk ) 12:54, 13 February 2009 (UTC) 
 Advance Summon???? 
 Has any one else noticed that the term Tribute summoning has been replaced with Advance summon, I know that it's the OCG equivalent but I still like to know why it's not Tribute Summon in the english Dub. Why have 4Kids messed up so bad so many times this series?? -- Trivi-AM  17:21, 14 February 2009 (UTC)
 
 Most likely, when 4K!D$ dubbed this, they couldn't make the voice act suitable so they used it as a term only once (I guess). They also could dub it word by word (Literally), without using the TCG's terms.  Diehard Guy  17:28, 14 February 2009 (UTC) 
 Well from the episodes I've seen dubbed (and thats most of them) I've heard advance summon at least 7 times, sometimes even when the character isn't on the screen when saying it (see the duel between  Leo  and  Greiger ). -- Trivi-AM  17:31, 14 February 2009 (UTC) 
 It's not a mistake. The term Advanced Summon was part of the rule/terminology changes amde for 5D's. 4Kids decided to use it. UDE didn't. And the anime has never used the term "Tribute". They called it "Sacrifice" in previous series. Could be that the grammer is wrong (see  Tribute ), but I wouldn't say that for certain. --  Deltaneos  ( talk ) 21:26, 14 February 2009 (UTC) 
 Yes I know that it was 4Kids who decided to use the term and not UDE, all I was trying to say is that it's odd how they changed the episode's terminology because it's written down that  Akiza  saying Advance Summon was an error when other characters have said it and nothing beens mentioned. -- Trivi-AM  08:48, 16 February 2009 (UTC)
 
 
 Um... 
 Where did Episode 25 go?  KazilDarkeye  20:08, 8 March 2009 (UTC)
 
 That page was acting up for some reason earlier on. Anyway after refreshing the page it's back. --  Deltaneos  ( talk ) 20:30, 8 March 2009 (UTC) 
 Speculation 
 I was just thinking about this: The air dates of the English episodes.
 Episode 36: July 18th, 2009. 
Episode 37: July 25th, 2009. 
Episode 38: August 1st, 2009. 
Episode 39: August 8th, 2009. 
Episode 40: August 15th, 2009. 
Episode 41: August 22nd, 2009. 
Episode 42: August 29th, 2009. 
 How can one add these airdates?
 -- Winxfan1  13:04, 4 July 2009 (UTC)Winxfan1
 
 Considering you've called this section "Speculation", are those airdates guesses? If they have actually been confirmed, edit the episode page and add the English airdate after where it says  	| english air date    =   This page draws information from the episode pages. --  Deltaneos  ( talk ) 13:32, 4 July 2009 (UTC) 
 Episode 42 instead of 36 
 Does anyone know why the heck 4kids tv played Episode 42 instead of 36? They missed 6 Episodes.  —This unsigned comment was made by  Elemental Hero Kid Neos  ( talk  •  contribs ) 20:35, 18 July 2009 (UTC) 
 
 This is only a wild guess now. Please don't spread at as fact, without any further proof. The building getting attacked is similar to the September 11 attacks. There was a couple of Pokémon episodes got changed/banned for similar reasons IIRC. --  Deltaneos  ( talk ) 20:41, 18 July 2009 (UTC) 
 what Deltaneos stated is possible, but it also shows that 4kids might have dropped the ball ~MEOW~ Might of the BIRD Empire~~  20:43, 18 July 2009 (UTC) 
 4kids did say they would air the episodes on Cartoon Network and on the 5d's channel on 4kidstv.com  Winxfan1  11:53, 19 July 2009 (UTC)Winxfan1
 
 Personally I thin 4Kids realized the Dark Signer arc got a little out of hand and trimmed it down to size (5 bucks says they completely remove Dark Signer Bommer and Yusei/Rudger round 1 too) 
 Also, iirc, the following is shown - Kidnapping, Torture, Death, Two Creatures attacking the building (5-1 the Gecko was trying to eat Sayor before he did get eaten several episodes later (can only imagine how 4Kids will handle that)) which could be similar to the 9/11 Terrorist Attacks, and the FCC i'm sure wouldn't want to SHOW all of that, no matter how people feels about the FCC <Those are my thoughts only and therefore NOT FACT ~MEOW~ Might of the BIRD Empire~~  20:08, 29 July 2009 (UTC) 
 Airdates 
 Someone's after adding July 27, as their airdates, which I think was the date they were made available on the 4Kids site. Since they weren't shown on tv on those dates, I don't think it counts. Much like how we don't use the San Diego screening of the first episode as its airdate. --  Deltaneos  ( talk ) 13:30, 3 August 2009 (UTC)
 
 site problem 
 Does anyone know what is wrong with the site. Some sections looks like it's editing page  —This unsigned comment was made by  Elemental Hero Kid Neos  ( talk  •  contribs ) 00:10, 31 August 2009 (UTC) 
 
 Yes, SMW, which we are using to create this list, has been disabled temporarily. It's mentioned in the  notice , which is currently appearing on the top of every page. --  Deltaneos  ( talk ) 00:15, 31 August 2009 (UTC) 
 Episodes on Youtube 
 Does anyone know how Youtube got the Episodes before 4kids.tv?
 
 Am I missing something here? 
 I was searching on here to see what the release dates were for the newer episodes after "Mark of the Monkey IV," But not only do I get a dissapointment (I know, never trust the Wiki for everything), I also noticed that the dates for all of the episodes were behind by a month? I somebody other than 4kids showing these episodes or is the airdates thing screwing up again?  24.162.226.125  21:49, September 28, 2009 (UTC)
 
 Exactly which airdates are you saying are wrong? Episodes 48 onwards airred in the United Kingdom on CITV, before they aired in America. Are they the ones you think are behind by a month? --  Deltaneos  ( talk ) 22:09, September 28, 2009 (UTC) 
 Ooooohhhh, is that what it is? I kinda assumed that the U.S. got the first showings of the episodes, goes to show  how much I know. Thanks for telling me. 24.162.232.67  14:08, October 3, 2009 (UTC)

 Weekly Airings 
 Don't you miss the days when your favorite cartoons would have a new episode " weekly " and not " monthly ". What ever happened to the new episode a week routine? Kids don't want to wait a month for a few episodes, they want a new one every week. Kids hate waiting and are impatient by nature (at least all the ones I've met are) and want what they want here and now. -- Thanonyx  18:45, March 6, 2010 (UTC)

 i've added the english names for the final 3 episodes on their episode pages but they haven't shown up on the listings. have i done something wrong?  Excalibur sonic  23:28, March 12, 2010 (UTC)
 Renew that page, and it will show up. It happening to me when I tried to fixing Feature Cards, due to  Hundred-Eyes Dragon  being in it japan name when it was changing. -- FredCat100  23:32, March 12, 2010 (UTC)
 it worked, thanks. also would it be ok to add the australian airdate. can't find any other airdates for the episodes  Excalibur sonic  07:44, March 13, 2010 (UTC)
 
 Yu-Gi-Oh 5D's Episode Listing 
 I Was wondering, could the YUGIOH 5D'S episode listing be done in the same style as the BAKUGAN BATTLE BRAWLERS episode listing.-- Carnegg  ( talk  •  contribs ) 00:05, March 20, 2011 (UTC)
 
 You mean like  List of Bakugan Battle Brawlers episodes ? I don't think we'd switch to an exact copy of their episode list style, but I'd probably back you up if you wanted to request this in the  wiki discussion forum  (it would be better to use the same style for all of our episode/chapter/volume lists, than to have a single group of lists with their own style). ;)  「 ダイノ ガイ 千？！ 」 ?  ·  ☎ Dinoguy1000  21:00, March 20, 2011 (UTC)

 Its an SMW glitch. There is a wiki-wide problem right now that is causing all sorts of weird behavior. Stuff vanishing from navboxes being the most common. Nothing to do but wait for staff to fix it...  Cheesedude  ( talk  •  contribs ) 23:17, July 26, 2014 (UTC)
