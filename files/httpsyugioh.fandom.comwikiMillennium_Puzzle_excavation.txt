   This summary is currently incomplete. 
 After  Yugi Mutou  completed the  Millennium Puzzle , his body housed the soul of the Egyptian pharaoh,  Atem , who went on to become  Seto Kaiba 's rival. The  Ceremonial Battle  saw the departure of Atem from Yugi's body, into the underworld and the  Millennium Items , including the puzzle, falling into the depths of the Earth, beneath the mortuary temple. Kaiba was disappointed in not having defeated Atem in a fair game of  Duel Monsters  and made attempts to resurrect him, one of which involved retrieving the  Millennium Puzzle .
 A  work crew  and a  team of engineers  were hired to perform the excavation.  Mani  passed as one of the work crew in order to spy on progress for the  Prana . The workers were shown a photo of Yugi, wearing the Millennium Puzzle to know what they were looking for.
 When the crew retrieved the pieces of the Millennium Puzzle,  Mokuba Kaiba  notified Kaiba and Mani notified  Aigami . The crew ensured that all pieces had been retrieved and placed them in their most advanced security apparatus. Aigami teleported from  Domino City  to the Valley of the Kings, while Kaiba flew their in his  Blue-Eyes jet .
 Kaiba detected Aigami's presence of his  Duel Disk . He demanded that the puzzle be loaded into the helicopter right away. However the time lock on the security system required them to wait thirteen minutes, so Kaiba used the additional time to draw attention to Aigami's intrusion. Aigami, Mani and their friends came out of hiding and faced Kaiba.
