 Personality 
 Like other Knights of Hanoi, Clarissa is fiercely loyal to Varis and will carry out the ambitions of Dr. Kogami to the very end. Like Aso, Clarissa shows a degree of sympathy and mercy as seen when she felt remorse watching the six victims suffer during the Hanoi Project and when she had a change of heart and released the Deleted virus victims after her defeat by Blue Angel. 
 
 Etymology 
 Her Japanese surname means "waterfall". Her Japanese given name can be translated as "child of echoes".
 
 Biography 
 History 
 10 years before the present, Clarissa was one of Dr. Kogami's assistants who helped him plan and execute the Hanoi Project. Together with Kogami, Aso, and Dr. Genome, she helped create the Ignis – six AIs with free will based on the Lost Incident victims and the Duel Monsters attributes. When SOL Technologies infected Dr. Kogami with a computer virus to cover up the Hanoi Project, she helped recreate his consciousness inside the network, faithfully serving as a Knight of Hanoi ever since.
 
 Season one 
 After losing to Blue Angel, Clarissa activated the removal program in a change of heart, curing all the Deleted victims. Consequently, the Knights of Hanoi 'purged' her shortly after for releasing the removal program. 
 
 Season two 
 Following the collapse of the Tower of Hanoi, Clarissa was sentenced to a maximum security prison and was placed under strict security, but later escaped and returned to the Knights of Hanoi thanks to help from Varis, Specter, Aso and Dr. Genome. Along with her comrades, Baira destroyed Echo programs. After she finished with them, Baira along with Dr. Genome and Faust rushed to Revolver watching his duel with Windy. They reported to Revolver that they finished their job and watched the rest of the duel. After the duel was over, Baira, Dr. Genome and Faust activate the anti-Ignis program and were about to kill Windy, but before Windy dies, he was saved by Lightning who declared war against humanity.
 After Lightning's war against the humans, Baira was present as Varis resolved to team up with Playmaker and his comrades in order to stop Lightning's faction. While her leader and Spectre would scour Mirror LINK VRAINS for the LIGHT Ignis, Clarissa, Aso, and Genome would monitor the network in the real world. The three Commander Knights witnessed each of the Duels, including the defeat of their 2 superiors at the hand of Lightning. They later aid Playmaker in his Duel with Bohman, attempting to shut down the Neuron Link Bohman used to abuse his Master Storm Access skill, which was powered by the minds of people in real LINK VRAINS. They witnessed the humanoid AI's defeat by Playmaker's hand, using " Firewall Dragon Darkfluid ," as well as the subconsciousness of all the innocent people killed.
 
 Season three 
 One month after the events of the war on humanity, Baira was present in LINK VRAINS with the other Knights of Hanoi, following a string of attacks on SOL Technology, including the high executive, Queen. The Knights and Playmaker's team witnessed as the attacker revealed himself as Ai, now in human form, along with  Roboppi . Revolver resolved to team up once more, to stop Ai from carrying out his unknown plan. 
 Baira, Dr. Genome, Faust, and Specter attempt to stall Ai, and prevent him from stealing the code key from  Akira Zaizen , but are all easily defeated by his " @Ignister " deck. Ai succeeds in taking the code key from Akira, and ends up taking control of SOL Technology.
 Three months following Ai's supposed death by Playmaker's hand, Clairissa, Aso, Genome, and  Pandor  are monitoring over the safety LINK VRAINS on Varis's boat, as a way to atone for their cyber crimes from earlier.
 
 Deck 
 Clarissa uses a  " Virus " Deck,  focusing on the restriction of her opponent's Monsters through effect negation and the zeroing of Attack points.  [3]  To facilitate her use of "Virus" cards, she uses  DARK   monsters , including the " Dark Mummy "  archetype , along with " Temple of the Kings ", which allows for their activation immediately upon their setting on the field. Baira's deck reflects her medical background, as well as her status as the mastermind behind the Deleted virus.
