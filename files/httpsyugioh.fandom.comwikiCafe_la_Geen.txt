      Jack served at Cafe la Geen.     
 Cafe la Geen  is a coffee shop in  New Domino City . This shop sells the expensive coffee,  Blue-Eyes Mountain  for 3000 yen, which is the same value as the  ATK  of " Blue-Eyes White Dragon ".
 Jack Atlas  has gone to the cafe to drink Blue-Eyes Mountain coffee. The waitress  Stephanie  has a crush on Jack. She usually serves him, but could never pluck the courage to talk and gets jealous after seeing  Carly  sit with him.
 Much to Stephanie's joy, Jack later got a job here. However Jack ended up getting fired, before she had a chance to get close to him.
