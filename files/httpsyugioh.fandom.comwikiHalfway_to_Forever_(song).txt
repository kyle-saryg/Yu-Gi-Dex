Starting with Episode 99, the opening changes to feature clips from  Dualism of Mirrors  and  GO WAY GO WAY . With its final story arc, the opening changes featuring clips from  Wonder Wings  and  Challenge the GAME .
 The song's composition and lyrics are written by the team of Michael Brady, Shane Guenego, Arthur "Sam" Murakami, Jonathan Lattif, Michael Knoblauch and Brendan Brady of the Surefire Music Group. Vocals are performed by voice actor  Justin Badger . [1]

 Lyrics 
 English  French  Spanish  Portuguese  
 Still together as one 
Cuz divided we're none 
Ready to go, we  feel the flow 
 
So don't stand in our way 
You know we ain't afraid 
This is our time, we're in control 
 
If I trip up today 
You just wipe it away 
All of my fears are gone, erased 
 
Let us tear down the walls 
'Til the final night falls 
The bonds of our souls can't be replaced 
 
Let us fight together 
Regret it never  
Our dreams will be 
 
Halfway to 
Forever 
Our light comes shining through 
Reach down deep 
Beat defeat 
Do all that we can do 
Halfway to 
Forever 
We've got nothing to lose 
Keep breathing 
Believing 
 
Halfway to forever 
                 (FR) Générique Yu-Gi-Oh ! Zexal ! Saison 2     
 Ainda juntos, unidos 
Isto não acabou 
Pra sempre vencendo e alto ir 
 
Nada iremos temer  
Quando à frente seguir 
É nossa vez, vamos ganhar 
 
Agora sem hesitar 
Ninguém nos irá parar 
E os nossos medos vão desaparecer 
 
Não há batalhas sem nós 
Unidos vamos vencer 
Junta a tua e a minha voz 
 
Nós podemos ir até ao fim 
Os nossos sonhos serão mais reais 
 
Ao meio da viagem 
Já brilha uma luz 
A um passo do abismo 
Saltamos sem olhar 
Ao meio da viagem  
Sem nada a perder 
Confia minha vida 
 
Ao meio da viagem 
 
 
 Trivia
