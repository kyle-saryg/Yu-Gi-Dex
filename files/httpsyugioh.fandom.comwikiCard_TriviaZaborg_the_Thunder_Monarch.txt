 This monster appears in the artwork of " Lightning Crash ", " Icy Crevasse ", " Fake Explosion ", " March of the Monarchs ", " Domain of the True Monarchs " and " Tribute Carnival ". 
 Each  Attribute  has one "Monarch" - Barring Mega Monarchs. The only exceptions are  LIGHT  and  DARK , with 3 "Monarchs" each (LIGHT Monarchs being this card, " Kuraz the Light Monarch " and " Ehther the Heavenly Monarch ", and DARK Monarchs being " Caius the Shadow Monarch ", " Delg the Dark Monarch " and " Erebus the Underworld Monarch "). 
 This monster resembles " Thunder Knight ," with which it shares some visual elements and its Type/Attribute combination. "Thunder Knight" even appears together with "Zaborg" on the art of "Fake Explosion" and was introduced as part of a "Zaborg"-themed Deck in the anime. 
 This monster has an  upgraded form  in " Zaborg the Mega Monarch ."
 In addition, this monster bares a strong resemblance to the  Match winner  monster " Emperor of Lightning ," which might be considered an unofficial upgrade or retrained counterpart. 
 This card has a " Vassal " counterpart: " Mithra the Thunder Vassal ".
