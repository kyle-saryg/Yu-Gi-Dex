Starfoil Rare [1]  cards have a shiny pattern of stars over the entire card face. This is similar to  Mosaic Rare  cards, except that the patterns are stars instead of squares.
 They are found in  Battle Pack: Epic Dawn  (including the  Battle Pack Tournament prize cards ) and  Star Packs . One card in every pack (the wild card) is always a Starfoil Card. Every card in these sets is available as a Starfoil Rare. [2] 
 On the Official Card Database, this rarity is unmarked.
