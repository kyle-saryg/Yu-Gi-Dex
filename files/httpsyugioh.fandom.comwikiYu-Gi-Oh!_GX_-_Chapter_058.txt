 Summary 
 After defeating  Adrian Gecko ,  Jaden Yuki  encounters  Atticus Rhodes  in the woods. Atticus immediately challenges Jaden to a Duel, with his  planet card  and  spirit card  on the line. This greatly shocks Jaden, and  Tragoedia  proceeds to speak through Atticus, telling Jaden to accept the  Shadow Duel  or hand over the cards and run. Jaden accepts the challenge, with him insisting that Tragoedia wake up  Koyo Hibiki  should Jaden win. Tragoedia accepts this, but informs Jaden that he'll end up in the same state as Adrian should he lose.
 Elsewhere,  Principal MacKenzie  stands before Tragoedia's tablet.  Reggie MacKenzie  is spying on him, and Tragoedia realizes this, scolding her for spying on her father. Black fog erupts from the principal's hands and envelops Reggie, pinning her to wall. He demands that she return to him what he had given her, and the black fog lifts her " The Splendid Venus " card from her Deck case. The principal holds the card up, along with " The Big Saturn " and " The Despair Uranus ", remarking that Reggie has done a fine job up until now.
 Bastion Misawa 's Duel with  James Crocodile Cook  is underway. Bastion has 900  Life Points  and " Red Ogre " on the  field , while James has 1100 Life Points, " Spawn Alligator " and  an unknown monster . Bastion questions what is wrong with him. As he loses Life Points, his body's strength decreases as well. He wonders if it's an illusion and James  draws  " The Tyrant Neptune ", telling Bastion that it's time to end this. 
 Alexis Rhodes ' Duel with  Aster Phoenix  is also underway and she has just reduced his Life Points to 1500. This lets him move the " Vision Hero Increase " in his  Graveyard  to his  Spell & Trap Card Zone  as he has taken  damage . Alexis ends her turn, remarking that even if she destroys the " Vision Hero " monsters they return as "visions" in the Spell & Trap Card Zone. She currently has 2000 Life Points and " Blizzard Princess " on the field. Aster begins his turn, drawing " The Grand Jupiter ". He  Special Summons  "Increase" from his Spell & Trap Card Zone using " Vision Release ". The  effect  of "Increase"  activates , letting him Special Summon " Vision Hero Poisoner " from his Deck. He states it is time to bring the Duel to an end. 
 Chazz Princeton  also continues his Duel against  Axel Brodie . Chazz has 2100 Life Points, " Light End Dragon " and two  Set  cards on the field, while Axel has 1300 Life Points and two " Divisions ". Axel draws " The Blazing Mars " that Principal MacKenzie gave him and remarks that he can Summon it now and bring out its full potential. He believes he has an 80% chance of winning if he successfully Summons it, with the remaining 20% being Chazz's  face-down  cards. He doubts that Chazz's face-downs would destroy monsters, believing that Chazz has absolute faith in the power of his  Dragons  and wouldn't use  Trap Cards  to interfere with that. Axel activates the effects of his "Divisions",  Tributing  them to Special Summon four " Machine Tokens ". He  removes  three monsters in his  Graveyard  from play. As he does so, James Tributes two of his monsters as Aster does the same. "The Tyrant Neptune", "The Grand Jupiter" and "The Blazing Mars" are all Summoned.
 Chazz sees darkness emanating from "Mars" and questions if he's in another Shadow Duel. James' "Neptune" attacks Bastion's "Red Ogre", reducing his Life Points to zero. Bastion collapses and James remarks that he loves these life-or-death fights. Aster activates the effect of "Jupiter" effect,  discarding  two cards to  equip  Alexis' "Blizzard Princess", increasing the  ATK  of "Jupiter" by that of the equipped monster. He attacks, with both he and Alexis remarking that they feel a great pressure emanating from "Jupiter" that seems to be more than just  Solid Vision  holograms. Chazz calls Axel out on trying to discover the truth behind the Shadow Duels while starting one himself. Axel is confused by this, and Tragoedia takes control of him from afar, telling Chazz that this isn't a Shadow Duel, but that the game must be completed.
