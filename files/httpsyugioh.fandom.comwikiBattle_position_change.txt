A  monster's   battle position  can be changed in one of two ways: manually or by  card effect . For a full list of card effects that change battle positions, see  Changes battle positions .
 During an open  game state  in the  Main Phase , the  turn player  can manually change the battle position of any individual monster they  control . Each monster's battle position can only be changed manually once per  turn .
 If a monster is  Summoned ,  Normal Set , or  declares  an  attack  (even if the attack was  negated  or cancelled due to a  replay ), it cannot manually change its battle position for the rest of that turn. If a monster battles due to a card effect that  conducts damage calculation  without declaring an attack, it can still change its battle position afterwards.
 You cannot change monsters to  face-down   Attack Position , neither manually nor by a card effect. Face-down  Defense Position  monsters are always  flipped  when changed to Attack Position. If a monster is manually changed from face-down Defense Position to face-up Attack Position, it is  Flip Summoned  (which is both a Summon and a battle position change).
 Card effects that prevent monsters from changing battle positions only prevent them from changing their battle positions manually (except " Raging Cloudian ")—their battle positions can still be changed by card effects.
