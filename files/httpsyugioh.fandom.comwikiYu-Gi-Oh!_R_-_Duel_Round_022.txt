 "Outer Space Showdown!!"  is the twenty-second chapter of the  Yu-Gi-Oh! R  manga. It was first printed in Japan on January 21, 2006 in  V Jump  magazine. It was later reprinted in volume 3 of Yu-Gi-Oh! R.
 Depre Scott  and  Richie Merced  confront  Yugi  and  Gekko .  Dark Yugi  entrusts the Duel to Yugi as he and Depre begin.
 
 Featured Duel: Yugi Mutou vs. Depre Scott 
 Turn 1: Yugi 
 Yugi   Normal Summons  " Toy Soldier " (1500/1000) in  Attack Position  and  Sets  a card.
 Turn 2: Depre 
 Depre  Normal Summons " Eva Abductor " (1000/500) in Attack Position. He  activates  its  effect ,  discarding  a card to take  control  of "Toy Soldier". He  attacks   directly  with both  monsters , but Yugi activates his  face-down   Field Trap Card , " Sand Fortress ", which will  negate  up to 3000  Battle Damage , at which point it will  destroy  itself. The Battle Damage from both attacks is reduced to zero and it may still reduce another 500 before being destroyed.
 Turn 3: Yugi 
Yugi Sets two cards and Normal Summons " Silent Swordsman LV0 " (1000/1000) in Attack Position. Its  Level  will increase by 1 during each  Standby Phase , and with it its  ATK  will increase by 500.
 Turn 4: Depre 
Depre Sets a card and then  Tributes  "Eva Abductor" and "Toy Soldier" to Summon " Zeta Reticulant " (2400/2100) in Attack Position. "Zeta Reticulant" attacks "Silent Swordsman", but Yugi activates his face-down " Turn Jump ", making it so three  turns  instantly pass. Therefore, "Silent Swordsman" becomes a Level 3 monster and its ATK increases to 2500. The attack is redirected to it, but Depre activates his face-down " Interdimensional Matter Transporter ",  removing  his monster from play until his  End Phase  and stopping the attack. Depre activates the Field Spell Card, " Cosmic Space ", destroying "Sand Fortress". All face-up monsters gain  Life Star Counters  equal to their own Levels. A Life Star Counter will be removed from each monster during every End Phase. When a monster runs out of counters, it is destroyed. The effects are retroactive, so both monsters lose three counters due to "Turn Jump". Thus, "Silent Swordsman" has one counter remaining and "Zeta Reticulant" has two. During the End Phase, they both lose a counter, so "Silent Swordsman" is destroyed.
 Duel continues in  the next chapter .
