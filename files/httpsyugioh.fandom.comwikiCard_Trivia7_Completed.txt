 Even after the official term for  Magic Cards  was changed to  Spell Cards , the cards in the picture on this card still said Magic Card.
 Later prints of this card removed all words from the cards in the picture. 
 The cards within this card's art are not copies of " 7 ", though like that card, they are meant to be in a group of three and thus also reference " Slot Machine " like "7" does. 
 The three cards in the picture contain two that say ATK and one that says DEF, which was how  Bandit Keith  used his three copies of this card to power up his " Slot Machine " in his duel against  Joey Wheeler . 
 This is the only Equip Spell where the player can choose whether to give the equipped monster more ATK or more DEF. 
 This card appears in the artwork of “ Heavy Metal Raiders ”.
