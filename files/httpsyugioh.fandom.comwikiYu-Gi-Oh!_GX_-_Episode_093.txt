 Episode Summary 
 On a computer in the White dorm,  Sarina  tries to put sense into  Sartorius , but  The Light of Destruction  inside him makes him reject his sister's plea. Suddenly, a beam of light comes out and is seen by  Jaden Yuki . Then, the good Sartorius appears from the light and gives Jaden a small black case, telling him to protect it and not to return it to him. He then uses his mind control powers on Jaden so that he doesn't give whatever is in the case back to him, which turns out to be one of the  keys  to  SORA . On a boat, the good Sartorius appears before  Aster Phoenix , giving him the other key and then vanishes.
 Back in the White dorm, the evil Sartorius asks the real Sartorius, who was in the mirror at the time, where the keys to the satellite are, and the reflection responds that they are with the chosen Duelists. The real Sartorius explains he knew he wasn't strong enough to fight "him", so he gave them to someone who is. The possessed man punches the mirror in response, causing the image to disappear.  The Light of Destruction  then brainwashes  Alexis Rhodes  and tells her to get the satellite key back from Jaden by beating him in a duel.  Chazz Princeton  and  Atticus Rhodes  give Jaden their cards to help Alexis remember them.
 
 Featured Duel: Jaden Yuki vs. Alexis Rhodes 
 Turn 1: Alexis 
Alexis draws. She then  Normal Summons  " Snow Fairy " (1100/700) in  Attack Position . While this card is face-up on the  field , Jaden cannot activate  Spell Cards  from his hand nor can he activate any face-down Spell Cards on the turn they are Set. Alexis  Sets  a card.
 Turn 2: Jaden 
Jaden draws " Ojama Black " (0/1000) and subsequently Normal Summons it in  Defense Position . He then Sets a card (" Negate Attack ").
 Turn 3: Alexis 
Alexis draws " White Night Fort " and subsequently activates it. Now neither player can activate  Trap Cards  during their opponent's turn. Alexis then Normal Summons " Illusion Ice Sculpture " (0/0) in Attack Position. Due to the third effect of "Illusion Ice Sculpture", Jaden can't select any monster besides "Illusion Ice Sculpture" as an attack target. 
 Since "Illusion Ice Sculpture" was summoned, its first effect activates, allowing Alexis to target her "Snow Fairy" and make the ATK and DEF of "Illusion Ice Sculpture" the same as the ATK and DEF of "Snow Fairy" ("Illusion Ice Sculpture": 0 → 1100/0 → 700). "Snow Fairy" attacks and destroys "Ojama Black". "Illusion Ice Sculpture" attacks  directly  (Jaden 4000 → 2900).
 Turn 4: Jaden 
Jaden draws " Swing of Memories ". He then Normal Summons " Elemental Hero Sparkman " (1600/1400) in Attack Position. "Sparkman" attacks and destroys "Illusion Ice Sculpture" (Alexis 4000 → 3500). Jaden Sets a card ("Swing of Memories"). Jaden intends to activate "Swing of Memories" on his next turn.
 Turn 5: Alexis 
Alexis draws. She then activates " Icicle Sacrifice " to Special Summon an " Icicle Token " (0/0) in Attack Position at the cost of rendering one of her  Monster Card Zones  unusable. The "Icicle Token" counts as two Tributes for the Tribute Summon of a monster. 
 Alexis then Tributes her "Icicle Token" in order to Tribute Summon " White Night Queen " (2100/800) in Attack Position. She then activates the effect of "White Night Queen" to destroy Jaden's set "Swing of Memories". "White Night Queen" attacks and destroys "Sparkman" (Jaden 2900 → 2400). "Snow Fairy" attacks directly (Jaden 2400 → 1300).
 Duel continues in  the next episode .
