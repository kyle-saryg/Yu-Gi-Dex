 Years after Yugi's legendary battles, the game is so popular that special institutions dedicated to the art of the Duel have sprung up all over the world. Join Jaden Yuki and his pals at the Academy for the adventures of the next generation of "Yu-Gi-Oh!" [1]

 James "Crocodile" Cook, one of the four Duelists from America, eagerly challenges Atticus Rhodes to a Duel. Elsewhere, Jaden and Chazz unlock more secrets of their spirit cards, Winged Kuriboh and Light and Darkness Dragon. But their confrontation could lead to a Shadow Game that only one Duelist may survive! [2] 
 
 The Story So Far 
 On an island in the southern sea stands an academy where the next generation of duelists is trained. It is called Duel Academy! 
 Jaden Yuki learned about the excitement of dueling through an encounter with the World Dueling Champion, Koyo Hibiki. Entrusted with Hibiki's deck, Jaden takes on all challengers at the Academy in order to become a true duelist! 
 The tournament for the right to duel Kaiser Zane is over. With a new deck in hand, Jaden resolves to fight back the black shadow that's after the sprit cards. in the midst of all this, four American duel students arrive for an exchange battle. soon after, Crocodile, one of the four, challenges Alexis's brother Atticus to a duel. Even as Crocodile turns up the heat, Attius keeps his cool. What is his real power?! [2] 
 
 In the Next Volume… 
 The next series of duels at Duel Academy are about to begin, and Reggie Mackenzie's father, possessed by an evil spirit determined to wreck havoc, makes his move. By manipulating members of the group of visiting duelists from America, Mackenzie plants the seeds of destruction on Duel Academy Island. When Jaden takes on his next opponent, will he realize the evil he faces, or will an ancient spirit's scheme to resurrect itself go forward?
