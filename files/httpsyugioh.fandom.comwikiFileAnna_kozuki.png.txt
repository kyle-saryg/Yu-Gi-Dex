 Appearance 
       Anna's linework.     
 Anna has red hair, styled in a manner similar to  Jaden Yuki 's, but with longer hair. Her usual attire is a pink and white shirt, which reaches below her waist, black compression shorts and a pair of boots in the same colors as her shirt. During the  World Duel Carnival Finals , she initially wore a brown cloak over this outfit to hide her identity.
 
       Anna in  Tori 's uniform.     
 When she participated in the Couples Duel tournament, she stole and wore  Tori 's school uniform along with her brown shoes and socks. After the ceremonial Duel between Yuma and Astral, Anna was seen wearing her own first-year student  Heartland Academy  uniform. In the dub, her skirt was lengthened.
 
 Personality 
 When speaking in the Japanese version, Anna uses "ore" (俺) when referring to herself (supporting her tough girl attitude), a pronoun that is predominantly used by males and very seldom used by females (who are most likely tomboys in nature). Anna is also shown to be quite hotheaded and reckless, often rushing into things without thinking the situation through.
 Astral  calls her Dueling style very reckless (using up her entire hand in the second turn) but also very calculated (being able to push her opponent in a corner in only the third turn), which coincides with her personality.
 Anna has also displayed a degree of selfishness, seen when she had difficulty working together with  Yuma  during the  Couples Duel tournament , using his  monsters  to bring out her own (using his " Gogogo Golem " to  Xyz Summon   her ace card , as well as  Tributing  his " Gauntlet Launcher " with " Upgrade " to revive the aforementioned card). She was able to put aside her pride at the end of the Duel and activate " Devoted Love ", knowing it would cause her to lose but give Yuma an opportunity for victory.
 
 Flying Blaster 
       Anna's cannon.     
 Anna carries a powerful cannon with her that can fire multiple shots at once.
 This weapon can transform into a hovercraft, which Anna can use as transportation to get around, while still retaining its ability to fire. This is similar to the flight mode displayed by  Paradox's Duel Runner . However, while flying, she often doesn't pay attention to where she's going, which led to her bumping her head on a light pole and a bridge on two separate instances.
 The cannon is collapsible, able to be stored in a knapsack that can enlarge it to full size in a manner similar to how a parachute is activated.
 
 Biography 
 History 
         Anna defending bullied kids. (This scene was not shown in the dub)     
 While in elementary school Anna was a tough girl who protected bullied children, in addition, she had a soft side and had a crush on "Yuma". Before she transferred schools, she wanted to confess her feelings to Yuma, but he never showed up due to how she constantly mistreated him. It is later revealed that the boy Anna actually had feelings for was a different boy with a similar name to Yuma's,  Kumo Tsuyuma . [1] 
 
         Anna catches the flower bouquet thrown by  Brooke .     
 Anna was taught how to Duel by  Brooke Walker . She promised Anna that if she could beat her, then she'd do what ever Anna wished. [2]  She later attended the wedding of her friend and her husband,  Mayday Walker , managing to catch the bouquet. Anna then looked in the bouquet to find the " Devoted Love " card, which Brooke said would assist Anna in finding her true love. [3] 
 
 
 Yu-Gi-Oh! ZEXAL 
 World Duel Carnival Preliminaries 
         Anna's first appearance, along with her cannon.     
 On the morning of the  World Duel Carnival , Anna arrived in  Heartland City  via the train line. She was later seen observing the introduction to the tournament alongside Duelists such as  Charlie McCay ,  Quattro  and  Reginald Kastle . [4] 
 
         Anna assaulting  Yuma .     
 Later that day, Anna assaulted Yuma and  Tori  with her flying cannon, but continuously missed due to their swift tactics, despite doing it several times. When Anna finally managed to corner the duo, she fell off of her cannon and Yuma suggested that they Duel instead; if Anna won, then Yuma would become her boyfriend. Despite Anna's reckless and brute tactics through cards such as " Rocket Arrow Express " and " Superdreadnought Rail Cannon ", Yuma managed to defeat her with his new  Xyz Monster , " Temtempo the Percussion Djinn ". After the Duel, Tori revealed to Anna that Yuma isn't the boy she was after, it was  Kumo Tsuyuma . Since Anna did not officially enter the tournament, she could not give Yuma a  Heart Piece  for winning the Duel, therefore she just flew off on her flying launcher in anger. However, in the end she did develop feelings for him, first loving, then hating him after hitting her head while thinking about him. [1] 
 
 World Duel Carnival Finals 
         Anna hidden under a cloak.     
 Anna ambushed and tied up one of the WDC finalists and concealed her identity under a cloak, entering the finals in that person's place in an effort to meet with  Yuma  again. [5]  She then got onto one of the  Duel Coaster  carts and sped off with the other finalists, leaving Yuma behind. [6] 
 
         Anna on the  Duel Coaster .     
 Later on Anna arrived to save Yuma when the  Triad of Terror  gang up on him and managed to protect him at first. However, the Triad's various team formations cornered her as well up to the point of defeat if it hadn't been for the appearance of  Nistro  who evened out the battlefield. After Yuma defeated  Coyote , Anna and Nistro helped him defeat  Jackal  by allowing him to Summon " One-Eyed Skill Gainer ". However after this,  Wolfsbane  tried to defeat Yuma with a  direct attack  which Anna intercepted, causing her to lose the Duel and fall off of the Duel Coaster. She was rescued by her flying launcher, however. Her sacrifice enabled Yuma to defeat Wolf. She wished him good luck in the finals and flew off. [5] 
 
 Yu-Gi-Oh ZEXAL II 
 Barian Invasion 
         Anna and  Yuma  vs.  Brooke  and  Mayday .     
 During a festival hosted at  Heartland Academy , Anna blasted a hole into the Monster Cafe held by  Yuma  and his friends, annoying  Tori . Anna then laughed at Yuma's  cosplay  of " Temtempo the Percussion Djinn ".  Ray Shadows  then burst into the room to inform Yuma that  Brooke  and  Mayday Walker , a professional  Tag-Team  were entering the tournament and that Brooke would retire after that. Upon hearing this, Anna threatened Ray to see if he was telling the truth. Despite wanting to enter,  Jen  and  Summer  informed Anna that only students at the school could Duel against the pair. Upon hearing this, Anna stole Tori's school uniform in order to pass as a student at the school. She then forced Yuma to be her tag partner with her cannon. As the Duel began, Anna and Yuma began bickering, which greatly affected their Dueling performance, resulting in the destruction of Anna's " Superdreadnought Rail Cannon " as well as having to face off against the pair's " Skypalace Gangaridai ". [3]  As the Duel continued, Anna's selfishness continued to diminish any attempt at teamwork such as  Tributing  Yuma's " Gauntlet Launcher " via " Upgrade " to revive her "Gustav Max", which was later destroyed again by Brooke's " Chaos Xyz ", " CXyz Skypalace Babylon ". Despite this, Yuma saved Anna, taking a large amount of damage in doing so. This made Anna realize what Brooke meant with the " Devoted Love " card, which Anna used later on, allowing Yuma the chance to  Xyz Summon  " Number C39: Utopia Ray V ", winning them the Duel. Afterwards, Brooke told Anna that the reason she's quitting Dueling is because she's pregnant (in the dub, she retired to become a teacher). She then encouraged Anna to be Yuma's girlfriend and pushed her towards him, calling it a " direct attack " which accidentally caused the pair to fall down a flight of stairs. [2] 
 
 Barian Emperor Onslaught 
         Mizar  vs. Anna and  Nelson .     
 After  Mr. Heartland  was defeated, the  Seven Barian Emperors  arrived together on  Earth  in front of  Yuma . Together, they  Barian Battlemorphed . Yuma was then rendered unable to Duel when the  Emperor's Key  reacted with  Nash 's  Barian Emblem . Subsequently,  Roku  and  Kaze  arrived and pelted the Emperors with smoke bombs, allowing Yuma's group to escape. The Emperors gave chase and Anna arrived, assaulting  Mizar  with her cannon. He blocked the blow, with Anna telling him she won't let him lay a finger on Yuma no matter what. Mizar responded that he won't forgive anyone that gets in his way. Anna claimed that unforgiveness was her line, but was interpreted by another figure saying the same thing. It was  Nelson Andrews  still acting in his Star Sparrow persona, saying it was time for another "grand feast of justice". The two joined together to confront Mizar. Later in the Duel, Mizar performed a  Chaos Draw  alongside the other Emperors. [7]  He used " Rank-Up-Magic - The Seventh One " to bring out " Number C107: Neo Galaxy-Eyes Tachyon Dragon ". Anna told him to bring it on, saying she'd protect Yuma no matter what. The dragon defeated both her and Nelson and she expressed disdain for her inability to protect Yuma as their souls departed for  Barian World . [8] 
 
         Nelson and Anna watch  Astral  depart from  Earth .     
 Anna was revived after Nash was defeated by Yuma, appearing on the same spot where she and Nelson were defeated by Mizar. She flew on her cannon alongside Nelson to greet Yuma. Anna flew to  Yuma's house  to offer her support in the ceremonial Duel alongside her friends, but she accidentally created a hole in Yuma's bedroom wall with her cannon. She watched the ceremonial Duel between Yuma and  Astral . [9]  Later, Anna enrolled in  Heartland Academy  as a first-year student. [10] 
 
 Deck 
 Anna uses a  Railway  Deck [1]  primarily focused on  Xyz Summoning  her " Superdreadnought Rail Cannon Gustav Max ". As that card is  Rank  10, Anna utilizes several cards to easily access it such as " Night Express Knight " and " Southern Stars ". She also supports it with cards such as " Train Connection " and " Upgrade ". Anna's  Dueling  tactics have been described by  Astral  as reckless but calculated. [1] 
She used to have a Madolche deck as a child  [11]
