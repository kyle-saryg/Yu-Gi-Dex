 Spirit monsters  (スピリットモンスター  Supiritto monsutā ) are  Effect Monsters  with the  ability  "Spirit". Each of this type of monster has an effect that returns it to its owner's hand during the  End Phase  of the turn it is  Normal Summoned  or  flipped  face-up (or the turn it is Special Summoned in case of Spirit monsters that must be Special Summoned). With the exception of the  Special Summon Monster  " Yamato-no-Kami ", " Shinob "  Ritual Monsters , and the  Martial Arts Spirits , this kind of monster cannot be  Special Summoned . The " Martial Arts Spirit " monsters (which are  Pendulum  Spirit Monsters) are an exception to both of these typical characteristics: they can be either Normal or Special Summoned, but their effects (including the Spirit return effect) only activate when they are Normal Summoned.
 The designs of most Spirit monsters are based on icons from Eastern mythology. They all have very similar backgrounds, ostensibly the  Spirit World . Their OCG names are in  kanji , but the  furigana  is in  katakana , which normally would indicate a foreign-language word.

 History 
 Spirit monsters debuted in  Mythological Age  and received support for the first time in  The Duelist Genesis , which was released almost 7 years later. When they are reprinted, it is usually in  Structure Decks  and  Tournament Packs .
 There are no  archetypes  focused on Spirit monsters, but there is one  series  that does, " Shinob ". The only two archetypes that have Spirit monsters as members are " Ice Barrier " (" Sacred Spirit of the Ice Barrier ") and " Gishki " (" Gishki Natalia " and " Emilia "). Both archetypes are  WATER -Attribute, and their Spirit monsters don't represent any mythological figure, instead representing revived spirits of dead characters of their storyline. All of these Spirit monsters were introduced in the  Hidden Arsenal  series.
 Due to the low speed of a dedicated Spirit Deck, as well as their lack of Special Summons and field presence, they never experienced competitive relevance as a Deck theme (although individual members did). There are several competitively noteworthy Spirit monsters, such as " Yata-Garasu ", the fundamental part of the  Yata-Garasu Lockdown , which was  Forbidden  for 17 years until 2022; " Tsukuyomi ", which used to be Forbidden due to its ability to  Set   Flip monsters  again to allow them to activate their effects again, enabling powerful loops; and " Asura Priest ", whose ability to attack every opposing monster was unique at the time of its release.
 
 In the anime 
 In the  Yu-Gi-Oh!  anime, in episodes  117  and  118 ,  Noah Kaiba  used Spirit monsters in his duel against  Yami Yugi . According to him, the Spirit monsters were created by  Maximillion Pegasus  when he was traveling to Eastern Asia and drew inspiration from the religions and mythologies from that region.
 In  Yu-Gi-Oh! GX  and  Yu-Gi-Oh! ARC-V , "Asura Priest" and "Dark Dust Spirit" had cameo appearances, in episodes  111  and  21 , respectively.

 Latest effect text (using  PSCT ) reads as follow:
 
 Cannot be Special Summoned. [...] Once per turn, during the End Phase, if this card was Normal Summoned or flipped face-up this turn: Return it to the hand.
 
 Playing style 
 Spirit monsters return to the hand during the End Phase of the turn they were Normal Summoned or flipped face-up, so it is difficult to maintain field presence. This can be worked around with cards like " Spiritual Energy Settle Machine ", " Mirror of Yata " and " Izanagi ", which allow Spirit monsters to remain on the field in spite of their effects. Also, " Shinobaron Peacock " and " Shinobaroness Peacock " can Special Summon a Level 4 or lower Spirit monster ( Ignoring its Summoning conditions ), which in turn will stay on the field, since it will not have been Normal Summoned. Alternately, some cards provide positive effects whenever a Spirit monster returns to the player's hand: " Spirit's Invitation " forces an opponent's monster to return to the hand whenever a Spirit returns to the hand.
 Spirit monsters have a wide variety of effects, including searching for cards (e.g. " Aratama "), allowing an extra Normal Summon (e.g. " Nikitama "), retrieving fallen monsters (e.g. " Izanami "), locking the opponent's attacks (e.g. " Great Long Nose "), and destroying all monsters the opponent controls (e.g. " Dark Dust Spirit "). "Shinobaron Peacock" and "Shinobaroness Peacock" Special Summon a Spirit monster  ignoring its Summoning conditions  while getting rid of up to 3 opposing cards in the process, and " Shinobird Salvation " destroys an opposing card once per turn when a Spirit monster returns to the hand.
 Two of the strongest Spirit monsters, " Hino-Kagu-Tsuchi " and " Yamata Dragon ", focus on maintaining significant hand advantage over the opponent, with their effects activating when they inflict  battle damage : "Hino-Kagu-Tsuchi" empties the opponent's entire hand before their Draw Phase, while "Yamata Dragon" fills its controller's hand with up to 5 cards.
 Since Spirit monsters only return to the hand during the End Phase of the turn they are Normal Summoned or flipped face-up, if they fail to return to the hand, such as due to " Dimensionhole " or " Forbidden Chalice ", they will not return to the hand in subsequent turns.
 There are however monsters like " Dark Dust Spirit " and "Fenghuang" that shine when they can be used repeatedly. Both have the ability to level the field, " Dark Dust Spirit " destroying all monsters, "Fenghuang" destroying all of the opponent's set spell/trap cards. Summoning them repeatedly can be made easier by running cards like "Majiosheldon" and " The Monarchs Stormforth ". When running these cards, using "Escalation of the Monarchs" as well is advised, as it allows the player to splash either of these monsters during the opponents turn, repeatedly regaining field control. 
 
 Recommended cards 
 Some of the generic cards that may help a Spirit Deck include:
 
 " Gorz the Emissary of Darkness ", " Tragoedia " and " Battle Fader ": due to the lack of field presence, the player is likely to be frequently open for direct attacks. Also, these monsters can be used as fodder for the Tribute Summon of a Spirit monster. 
 " Marshmallon " and " Spirit Reaper ": Since these monsters cannot be destroyed in battle, they can survive long enough to be used as tributes for a high-level monster, as long as your opponent doesn't use card effects to destroy them. Use " My Body as a Shield ", " Magic Jammer ", " Seven Tools of the Bandit ", and other spell/trap/destruction negation cards to protect them. 
 " Black Luster Soldier - Envoy of the Beginning ": it can be a great  beatstick , and can be Summoned by banishing, for example, "Nikitama", " Otohime ", " Asura Priest " or " Effect Veiler " and "Yamato-no-Kami", " Aratama ", " Great Long Nose " etc, giving the fallen Spirit monsters a last utility. 
 " Forbidden Chalice ": can be very useful, as it can negate the signature effect of the Spirit monsters and keep them on the field. Use this card after you used their main effect, like after attacking with "Hino-Kagu-Tsuchi" or after destroying a Spell/Trap Card with "Yamato-no-Kami". This card is more valuable when used on high-level monsters, such as "Great Long Nose" or "Yamata Dragon", or Spirits whose effects don't activate upon being Normal Summoned or flipped face-up, such as "Asura Priest" or "Fushi No Tori". 
 " D.D. Sprite ": this monster can also be used to keep a Spirit monster on the field, and since it is a  Tuner monster , it can allow the Deck to perform  Synchro Summons . " Ancient Sacred Wyvern " is a useful  Synchro Monster  that can be Summoned by using one of the Level 6 Spirit monsters; since the Deck frequently has cards that increase the difference between the players'  LP  (" Spring of Rebirth ", " Orb of Yasaka ", " Fushi No Tori ", etc.), this monster can be used at its maximum potential. 
 " Slacker Magician ": this monster can be easily Summoned by the effect of " Kinka-byo " and can serve as a wall, since it cannot be easily removed from the the field, except by effects that don't target. 
 " Creature Swap "/" Mystic Box ": the Spirit monster given to the opponent will return to its owner's hand anyway. 
 " The Monarchs Stormforth "/" Soul Exchange ": These cards can be used to get rid of an opponent's monster while also Tribute Summoning a Spirit monster. 
 " Soul Transition ": this card's drawback of not allowing Special Summons during the turn it is used generally is not a problem. It is best used if the monster tributed as cost is "Nikitama", while you control another Spirit monster, preferably "Aratama": in this scenario it is possible to draw 3 cards while also replacing the Tributed "Nikitama" with another copy of it, searched by "Aratama".

 Weaknesses 
 The main weaknesses of the Spirit Monsters are the fact that they can't stay on the field for long and cannot be Special Summoned (except "Yamato-No-Kami"), which make them having limited swarming capabilities. Due to the difficulty in maintaining field advantage, this Deck is susceptible to direct attacks, so  Beatdown  and  Aggro  Decks, like " Six Samurai ", " Dark World ", " Yosenju ", " Karakuri ", " Noble Knight ", " Spellbook ", etc are good against this Deck. 
 Stall  Decks are a large threat to this Deck, since it is inherently slow due to its lack of swarming and field presence. If "Hino-Kagu-Tsuchi" or "Yamata Dragon" is Summoned but doesn't get a chance to activate its effect, a lot of resources are wasted. As such, " Vengeful Bog Spirit ", " Level Limit - Area B ", " Threatening Roar ", " Gravity Bind ", " Chain Energy " and even " Skill Drain " can mean trouble. 
 " D.D. Designator " and " Mind Crush " can easily pick a card from the player's hand, since monsters frequently return there. 
 " Rivalry of Warlords " and " Gozen Match " can slow this deck down, since Spirit monster Decks typically uses Spirits of different Types and Attributes.

 Trivia 
 The Spirit monster " Yata-Garasu " is infamous for  its complete lockdown  of the opponent's hand when combined with " Chaos Emperor Dragon - Envoy of the End ". As a result, it remains Forbidden since 2004. "Chaos Emperor Dragon - Envoy of the End" would later receive an errata that allowed it to become Unlimited. 
 " Izanagi " is the only non-Spirit monster that has  Spirit World  in its background and the only non-Spirit monster that directly supports Spirit monsters. 
 " Soul Resurrection " is the only card that have the  Spirit World  in its background with absolutely no relation to Spirit monsters. 
 The effect that returns Spirit monsters to the hand, as well as their transparent appearance, may be a reference to them not being able to stay on the physical plane for long. 
 There are no  Insect ,  Reptile ,  Fish ,  Sea Serpent ,  Plant ,  Machine ,  Psychic ,  Wyrm ,  Cyberse , or  Dinosaur  type Spirit monsters.
