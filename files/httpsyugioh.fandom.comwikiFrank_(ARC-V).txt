 Biography 
 History 
 Amanda , Frank and  Tarren  were first found by  Crow Hogan  in an alley at night. Crow took them in and fed them, scolding them when they ate too quickly, and adopted them. [3] 
 
 Friendship Cup 
 Frank first appeared with Tarren at a  Topsiders ' square witnessing  Dennis McField 's magic show. He told an awed Tarren to hurry along. They were then seen hiding behind a bush, and witnessed  Yugo  and  Zuzu Boyle  outside of a restaurant trying to warn passers-by of an invasion. Frank and Tarren popped out to steal food from a tray at the restaurant. When they returned to Crow's house, they were promptly scolded by Crow. Frank then saw  Yuya Sakaki  and  Celina , mistaking them for Yugo and Zuzu. [1]  Later on, Frank and Crow told Yuya and  Sylvio Sawatari  about the origin of  Turbo Duels .  [4]  Frank and Tarren had a practice duel when they learned that Celina and Sylvio went out on their own. While the kids enjoyed their meal with  Riley Akaba , the kids witnessed Crow and Yuya arguing over whether a smile or a full stomach was more important. Crow tried to drag them into the argument, but the kids refused to comment, and they later watched Crow and Yuya Duel. Frank chose to support Crow by cheering when he Synchro Summoned " Assault Blackwing - Raikiri the Rain Shower ". Unfortunately,  Sector Security  arrived, having followed Celina and Sylvio back to Crow's house, and they arrested Yuya, Sylvio, Crow, Shinji, and Celina, but let the kids off. [5] 
 The kids snuck into the  Duel Palace  in order to watch Crow's Duel in the  Friendship Cup  against  Gong Strong , but the disguise that they used fell apart as soon as they got in, forcing them to evade Palace security the entire time and causing Crow to worry about them during the Duel. They cheered Crow on as he defeated Gong, and quickly fled the palace. [3]  At some point, he, Amanda and Tarren watched the Duel between  Shay Obsidian  and Dennis, where he developed a dislike for Shay due to his brutal tactics. [2] 
 
 Friendship Cup Finals 
 The kids later found Zuzu in the Commons after her brutal loss to  Sergey Volkov . They brought her to an overpass to see Crow and Shay's Duel, as they couldn't sneak into the Duel Palace again and the matches were now taking place on the duel lanes around New Domino City.  [6]  During the duel, Frank saw that Tarren went missing, only to spot him hanging off "Raikiri's" back. Frank tried to catch him from the railing he was sitting on, only for Shay on his " Raidraptor - Revolution Falcon " to catch Tarren instead and bring him back to where Frank, Amanda and Zuzu were.  [7]  After the duel, the kids and Zuzu were cornered by Sector Security officers tasked to capture Zuzu; fortunately they were rescued by  Sora Perse , and the three children were awed by Sora and Zuzu's Tag Duel and impressed when they learned Sora had saved her. The three children learned about the invasion of the  Obelisk Force  when  Moon Shadow  arrived. Amanda, Frank, and Tarren were dismayed to learn from Moon that they also had to go with Zuzu and hide in the  Underground Labor Facility . [8] 
 During their time in the Underground, they learned about the strange abilities of  Zuzu's bracelet , which they found strange and fascinating. The three children had to tirelessly dissuade and physically prevent Zuzu from leaving the Underground several times because of her concern for Yuya. Zuzu eventually slipped away after Shay and Shinji started rioting, and the kids frantically began to search for her after they realized she escaped, and quickly alerted  Gong ,  Chojiro Tokumatsu , and Crow. [9] 
 After escaping the Underground, the three children convened with Crow in an alleyway. Amanda had to talk Tarren and Frank down a few times, as Crow warned them to beware of anyone suspicious, and Amanda reminded them that they didn't have  Duel Disks , so they wouldn't be able to take on their enemies. [10]  They split up from Crow to begin searching for Yuya, Zuzu, Celina, and Sora. They reunited with Yuya, Gong, and  Sam  during Yuya's attempt to get back to the  Duel Palace . Amanda, Frank and Tarren were shocked and saddened to hear of Celina's recapture by the Obelisk Force and led Yuya to another pathway to the Duel Palace. He, Amanda, Tarren, and Sam also ended up traveling on Shay's two " Raidraptor - Force Strix ", flying over New Domino City for the first time in their lives. [11] . They stayed behind to watch the Friendship Cup Final between Yuya Sakaki and  Jack Atlas . [11] .
 
 Heartland City 
 Frank,  Amanda , and  Tarren  asked Jack Atlas to go help  Crow  and the  others , reassuring him that he could leave  New Domino City  to them. [12] 
 
 Duel Academy 
 Amanda, Frank,  Tarren ,  Sam , and  Chojiro  witnessed the appearance of a  massive dragon  in a dimensional rift. [13]  They later witnessed  Jack  and  Crow  each take on  Z-ARC , the Duelist controlling the dragon, and their subsequent defeats and that of  Declan Akaba , before Z-ARC was finally defeated by  Riley Akaba .
 After  Z-ARC 's defeat, Frank is seen watching  Yuya 's Duel against  Jack  with  Shinji ,  Damon ,  Tony ,  Amanda ,  Tarren ,  Sam ,  Chojiro , and his lackeys. [14]  He cheered with Tarren when Yuya won and watched Yuya and  Declan 's  Action Duel . [15]  Frank watched Yuya and Declan gather  Action Cards  to in order for one of them to win the Duel first due to the effect of " Performapal Five-Rainbow Magician ". He was happy when Yuya won and was sent to the  Pendulum Dimension  by  Ray Akaba  to witness her revival as  Zuzu  and was surprised by  Rin 's spirit reviving as well. [16]
