The remaining cards in Rebecca's hand at this point are " Gravity Bind ", " Adamantine Sword Revival ", " Luster Dragon #2 ", " Polymerization ", "Fire Princess", and "The Shallow Grave". Rebecca  Normal Summons  "Fire Princess" (1300/1500) in  Attack Position  and  Sets  a card.

 Leon  draws. He then Normal Summons " Forest Wolf " (1800/300) in Attack Position. "Forest Wolf"  attacks  and  destroys  "Fire Princess" (Rebecca 4000 → 3500). Since "Forest Wolf" destroyed a monster by battle, its first effect activates,  equipping  the destroyed monster to "Forest Wolf" instead of sending it to the  Graveyard .
 Leon then activates " Curse of Thorns " to  select  the "Marie the Fallen One" in Rebecca's Graveyard. Now the effects of "Marie the Fallen One" is negated while it is in the Graveyard, but if it is removed from the Graveyard, "Curse of Thorns" will be destroyed.

Leon then activates " Gingerbread House ".
 Turn 5: Rebecca Hawkins 
Rebecca draws. During her  Standby Phase , the effect of "Gingerbread House" activates, increasing the ATK of "Luster Dragon" by 600 ("Luster Dragon": 1900 → 2500/1600). Since the  ATK  of "Luster Dragon" became 2500 by this effect, the second effect of "Gingerbread House" activates, destroying "Luster Dragon" and increasing Leon's  Life Points  by 500 (Leon 2600 → 3100). 
 Rebecca then activates "The Shallow Grave" to allow both players to  Special Summon  one  monster  from their  Graveyard  in  Defense Position .

Leon then activates " Glass Slippers " from his hand and equips "Glass Slippers" to "Cinderella". 
 "Cinderella" attacks directly due to the effect of "Pumpkin Carriage" (Rebecca 3300 → 3000). Since "Cinderella" inflicted  Battle damage  by a direct attack, the effect of "Glass Slippers" activates, allowing Leon to equip it to "Luster Dragon #2". Due to the effect of "Glass Slippers", the  ATK  of "Luster Dragon 2" decreases by 1000 ("Luster Dragon #2": 2400 → 1400/1400). 
 "Forest Wolf" attacks and destroys "Luster Dragon #2" (Rebecca 3000 → 2600). Leon then activates the first effect of "Forest Wolf" to equip "Luster Dragon #2" to it. Since "Luster Dragon 2" was destroyed, the last effect of "Glass Slippers" activates, equipping itself to "Cinderella". At this point, the last effect of "Cinderella" activates, increasing its own  ATK  by 1000 ("Cinderella": 300 → 1300/600). Leon Sets a card.
 Turn 7: Rebecca Hawkins

 Differences in adaptations 
 Solomon's doctor is named Dr. Grossfeld in the English dub, a nod to 4Kids producer Norman J. Grossfeld. 
 Marie the Fallen One being pulled out of the  GY  by Curse of Thorns, is always shown from far away. 
 Errors 
       " Fire Princess " is shown instead of " Pumpkin Carriage ".     
 Near the end of the episode, " Fire Princess " can be seen in Leon's Duel Disk instead of " Pumpkin Carriage ". 
 When " Glife the Phantom Bird " is summoned, Rebecca says that her face-down  Magic  Card (" Gravity Card ") would stop it. "Gravity Bind" is a  Trap  Card, not a Magic Card. 
 At the start of the episode, during the shot of the spectators, the one on the top right in the red shirt is missing his mouth.
