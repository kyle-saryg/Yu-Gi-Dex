 "Shadow Game!!" , known as  "Duel of Darkness!!"  in the Japanese version, is the twenty-ninth chapter of the  Yu-Gi-Oh! GX  manga .

 Summary 
 Midori Hibiki  announces the start of the final match of the tournament's semifinals -  Chazz Princeton  vs.  David Rabb , with the winner moving on to face  Jaden Yuki  in the finals. At the docks, the ship that transports  Duel Academy  its food has arrived, with  Atticus Rhodes  having hitched a ride back in with it. He can hear cheering coming from the Academy, and asks what's going on. The ship's captain replies that some sort of tournament is being held in honor of a returning student. Atticus moves towards the academy, correctly speculating that the tournament is in honor of  Zane Truesdale , and that the prizes are test exemptions and a Duel with Zane.  Reggie MacKenzie  is still perplexed by the existence of a second spirit card, as " Winged Kuriboh " was without a doubt their target, with  the shadow  having been searching for it for years. The shadow seemed afraid when it sensed the spirit of " Light and Darkness Dragon " The shadow is shocked at a relic of  the priests  still existing, and again calls the dragon the " Feather of Ma'at ", while the physical feather is shown on one end of the  Millennium Scale , with a white-colored "Winged Kuriboh" on the other end.
 As they wait for the match to begin, Jaden states he'd like Chazz to win. David approaches the arena from behind him, and tells Jaden that the final match will be him vs. Jaden. As he walks by, he whispers that it will be a  Shadow Game , and also realizes that Jaden sensed Chazz's Dragon spirit. His goal was to obtain a spirit card, and he now aims to obtain both "Light and Darkness Dragon" and "Winged Kuriboh". David and Chazz meet at the arena, and David tells him that this Duel will be like nothing he's ever experienced, and that Chazz should try to keep him entertained by "writhing in pain". He claims Chazz's spirit card will soon be his, and is surprised to learn that Chazz is aware of his spirit. David's earring glows as he begins his first turn, and black fog envelops the arena. David  Summons  " Quantity " in  Defense Position  and  Sets  a card. Chazz Summons " Shining Dragon " in  Attack Position  and attacks "Quantity", with David activating his  face-down  " Scrap Storage ",  sending  the two copies of "Quantity" in his  Deck  to the  Graveyard .
 David Summons " Quality " in Defense Position and Sets a card. Chazz is surprised that he keeps playing defense, despite talking such a big game, and believes he's just using the black mist in an attempt to scare him, assuming that it is the result of the holograms from David's monsters. Midori realizes that the fog isn't from a card effect, and David is shocked to see that she can even see the black fog, as normal people should not be able to do so. He wonders if Midori has a spirit card as well, and is confused as to why they all seem to be concentrated at  Duel Academy . Chazz  Tributes  "Shining Dragon" to Summon " Genesis Dragon ", who attacks and destroys "Quality", whose effect activates,  Special Summoning  the three "Quantities" from his Graveyard in Attack Position. David activates his face-down " Indestructible Armor Plating ", which will prevent his "Quantities" from being  destroyed in battle . Chazz Sets a card. David activates " Long-Range Strike ", which let his "Quantities" attack Chazz  directly  this turn. The first attacks, and Chazz appears to be feel real pain from the attack, and even sees blood on his hand. The second attacks, and Chazz nearly collapses.  Syrus Truesdale  and  Alexis Rhodes  wonder why Chazz is putting on such a performance, not able to see the black fog or the blood. Jaden can see them, however, and rushes forward in an attempt to stop the Duel. David claims he's having fun seeing Chazz in such pain. Chazz attempts to get to his feet, and also tells Jaden to stay out of it, saying that he'd never hand over his partner to David, and he wants to complete the Duel.
