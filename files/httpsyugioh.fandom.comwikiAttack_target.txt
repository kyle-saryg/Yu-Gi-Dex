 An  attack target  (Japanese:  攻 撃 対 象   kōgeki taishō ) is either a player or monster designated for an attack. [1] [Notes 1] 
 During the  Battle Step , the  turn player  can  declare  an attack by targeting either an opponent's monster or the opponent themself. If a  replay  occurs, the turn player can select an attack target again (even if it is the same choice), potentially allowing for effects that activate upon a monster being targeted for an attack to activate again, such as that of " Vengeful Shinobi ".
 Some card effects can restrict a player's choice of attack target (such as that of " Marshmallon Glasses ") or conduct  battle  with a monster without selecting it as an attack target (such as that of " Dreamsprite "). [2]  There are also card effects that allow a player's opponent to choose their attack targets for them, such as that of " Patrician of Darkness ".

 Notes 
 
 ↑   Players can be considered "attack targets", in context of the texts of " Construction Train Signal Red ", " Patrician of Darkness " and  the UDE rulings of the latter card .

"If you control "Dreamsprite", "The Legendary Fisherman", and "Umi" is on the field, "Dreamsprite"’s effect can still change an attack target to "The Legendary Fisherman" because he is not being targeted with an attack, but is being targeted with a monster effect."
