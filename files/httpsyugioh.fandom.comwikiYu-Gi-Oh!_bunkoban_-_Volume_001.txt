 Yu-Gi-Oh! 2 
 
 
 
 
 
 This is the first volume of the reprint of the  Yu-Gi-Oh!  manga  in  bunkoban  form.
 It included the tarot card,  The Magician , featuring  Dark Yugi ,  Black Magician  and  Black Magician Girl  in its design.
 
 Afterword 
 Kazuki Takahashi  talks about starting the reprint series. He mentions that he very rarely re-reads a series after completion, fearing the embarrassment. He designed the covers for the occasion and felt there was a considerable gap compared to his artwork back at the beginning of the series, but commented that he still likes his early art.
 He divided the story into the following chapters:
 
 
 
 Chapter
 
 Name
 
 
 Chapter 1 
 School arc
 
 
 Chapter 2 
 Death-T  arc
 
 
 Chapter 3 
 RPG ( Monster World ) arc
 
 
 Chapter 4 
 Duelist Kingdom 
 
 
 Chapter 5 
 D·D·D  arc
 
 
 Chapter 6 
 Battle City 
 
 
 Final Chapter 
 Pharaoh's Memory  arc
 
 While the card game is more mainstream, he feels attached to the School arc in many ways. He recollects how it felt to overcome difficulties developing characters' personalities and relationships while under the pressure of trying to meet unfamiliar deadlines associated with a weekly series. Every character holding a weakness in their heart similar to the  Millennium Puzzle  was the key to the story, he felt and each character became a different piece to a puzzle.
 He talks a bit about  Yu-Gi-Oh GX , commenting that  Yu-Gi-Oh!  is being extended and thanks all the people involved in making and supporting the series.
