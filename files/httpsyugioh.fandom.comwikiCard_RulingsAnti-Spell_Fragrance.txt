 TCG Rulings 
 Judge Program Forum Rulings 
   These Ruling(s) have not  been confirmed as applicable to the TCG. [Notes 1] 
 " Anti-Spell Fragrance " makes it so both players must first  Set  their  Spell Cards  after it successfully resolves. It does not negate the activation of cards already on the  Chain . In addition, the cards on the chain are already activated so " Anti-Spell Fragrance " will not have any effect on them. [1] 
 OCG Rulings 
 Even if you Set a  Quick-Play Spell Card , it cannot be activated until your next  turn . [2] 
 While the effect of " Anti-Spell Fragrance " is being applied, you can still use  Spell Cards  in your  hand  for a  cost . [3] 
 While the effect of " Anti-Spell Fragrance " is being applied,  Pendulum Monsters  cannot be activated as  Spell Cards  in the  Pendulum Zones . Also, if you already  control  2 Pendulum Monsters in your Pendulum Zones and " Anti-Spell Fragrance " is activated, then you can perform a Pendulum Summon normally. [4] 
 Previously Official Rulings 
   These TCG rulings were issued by  Upper Deck Entertainment  and have since been deemed unofficial by Konami. [5]  They were previously considered official and can still be correct, as long as they follow the official gameplay rules, or unless Konami has issued a ruling that says otherwise. References:  [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] 
 
 The "use" in this card's text means " activate ". So you may  discard   Spell Cards  from your  hand  for the  cost  of other cards.
