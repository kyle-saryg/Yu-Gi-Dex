 Featured Duels 
 Moon Shadow vs. Obelisk Force: Red, Green and Yellow 
       Obelisk Force  vs.  Moon Shadow .     
 At the start of the  Duel , the  Field Spell Card  " Crossover " is  activated , as per the rules of an  Action Duel . It will allow the players to use  Action Cards , but they may only have one in their  hand  at a time.
 The members of  Obelisk Force  are not named, but are differentiated from one another here by the color of the gemstone on their masks.
 Turn 1: Red 
Red  Normal Summons  " Ancient Gear Hunting Hound " (1000/1000) and  Sets  a card.
 Turn 2: Moon Shadow 
 Moon Shadow  activates " Ninjitsu Art of Hazy Duplication ", letting him  Special Summon  a  Level  4 or lower " Ninja "  monster  from his hand. He Special Summons " Twilight Ninja Shingetsu " (1500/100) in  Attack Position . He  Tributes  "Shingetsu" to  Tribute Summon  " Twilight Ninja Getsuga, the Shogun " (2000/3000) in Attack Position, which can be Tribute Summoned with 1 Tribute by Tributing a "Ninja" monster. "Getsuga"  attacks  "Hunting Hound", but Red activates his  face-down  " Fusion Trench ", which prevents non- Fusion Monsters  from attacking. Moon Shadow Sets two cards. 
 Turn 3: Green 
Green activates " Polymerization ",  fusing  three copies of "Hunting Hound" from his hand to Fusion Summon " Triple Ancient Gear Hunting Hound " (1800/1000) in Attack Position. Red activates the other effect of "Fusion Trench", which lets the  controller  of a Fusion Monster attack  directly  with that monster  once per turn  if they did not Normal or Special Summon a non-Fusion Monster this turn. "Triple Hunting Hound" attacks directly (Moon Shadow: 4000 → 2200).
 Turn 4: Yellow 
Yellow activates "Polymerization", fusing three copies of "Hunting Hound" from his hand to Fusion Summon "Triple Ancient Gear Hunting Hound" (1800/1000). Red activates the effect of "Fusion Trench" to allow "Triple Hunting Hound" to attack directly (Moon Shadow: 2200 → 400).
 Sora  joins the Duel at this point, taking the 2000  LP  intrusion penalty (Sora: 4000 → 2000).
 
       Sora   activates  " Frightfur Sanctuary ".     
 Turn 5: Sora 
Sora activates " Frightfur Sanctuary ",  sending  a card from his hand and two " Frightfur " monsters from his  Extra Deck  to his  Graveyard . He sends " Edge Imp Frightfuloid ", " Frightfur Bear ", and " Frightfur Leo ". "Sanctuary" also treats all Fusion Monsters Sora controls as "Frightfur" monsters. Sora activates " Frightfur Fusion ", which allows him to Fusion Summon a "Frightfur" Fusion Monster from his Extra Deck by  banishing  monsters on his side of the field or Graveyard as the Fusion Materials. He banishes "Leo", "Bear", and "Frightfuloid", which is treated as a "Frightfur" monster via its own effect, from his Graveyard to Fusion Summon " Frightfur Chimera " (2800/2000) in Attack Position. He activates "Polymerization", fusing the " Fluffal Bear " and " Edge Imp Sabres " from his hand to Fusion Summon " Frightfur Tiger " (1900/1200) in Attack Position. The effect of the Fusion Summoned "Tiger" activates, allowing Sora to  destroy  cards his opponent controls up to the number of Fusion Materials used for its Fusion Summon. Sora destroys "Fusion Trench". The effect of "Tiger" increases the  ATK  of all "Frightfur" monsters Sora controls by 300 for each " Fluffal " and "Frightfur" monster he controls ("Tiger": 1900 → 2500, "Chimera": 2800 → 3400). Moon Shadow activates his face-down " Barrier Ninjitsu Art of Transcription ", which lets a monster he controls gain the effect of an opponent's monster until the  End Phase . Moon Shadow targets "Chimera" and lets it gain the effect of "Triple Hunting Hound". With the gained effect from "Triple Hunting Hound", "Chimera" can attack up to three monsters during each  Battle Phase . "Chimera" attacks and destroys Green's "Triple Hunting Hound" (Green: 4000 → 2400). As it destroyed an opponent's monster  by battle  and sent it to the Graveyard, the effect of "Chimera" lets Sora Special Summon that destroyed "Triple Hunting Hound" to his side of the field. "Chimera" gains 300 ATK for each monster Sora controls that was Special Summoned by this effect (3400 → 3700). With the effect of "Frightfur Sanctuary", the Fusion Monster "Triple Hunting Hound" is treated as a "Frightfur" monster and the effect of "Tiger" increases the ATK of all "Frightfur" monsters Sora controls ("Tiger": 2500 → 2800, "Chimera": 3400 → 4000,  "Triple Hunting Hound": 1800 → 2700). "Chimera" attacks and destroys Yellow's "Triple Hunting Hound" (Yellow: 4000 → 1800). With the effect of "Chimera", Sora Special Summons the destroyed "Triple Hunting Hound" to his side of the field and "Chimera" gains 300 ATK for it via its own effect ("Chimera" 4000 → 4300). "Frightfur Sanctuary" treats the second "Triple Hunting Hound" as a "Frightfur" monster and the effect of "Tiger" increases the ATK of all of Sora's monsters ("Tiger": 2800 → 3100, "Chimera": 4300 → 4600, Green's "Triple Hunting Hound": 2700 → 3000, Yellow's "Triple Hunting Hound": 1800 → 3000). "Chimera" attacks and destroys Red's "Hunting Hound" (Red: 4000 → 400). The effect of "Chimera" activates, allowing Sora to Special Summon the destroyed "Hunting Hound" to his side of the field and "Chimera" gains 300 ATK for it via its own effect (4600 → 4900). "Hunting Hound" and the two "Triple Hunting Hound" attack the three members of Obelisk Force directly (Red: 400 → 0, Green: 2400 → 0, Yellow: 1800 → 0).
