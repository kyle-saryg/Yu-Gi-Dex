For Duel Boards in Yu-Gi-Oh! VRAINS, see  D-Board .      
 The  Duel Board  is a special skateboard that was introduced in  episode 77  by  Lester . It is designed for  Turbo Duels , specifically so that children may participate.
 Similar to a  Duel Runner , this board uses the  Field Spell Card , " Speed World ". However, it is distinct from a Duel Runner in that it utilizes a  Duel Disk  connected to the back end of the board via a cord to function. It is much slower than a Duel Runner. 
 
 
 
 Leo's Duel Board . It was created by  Yusei Fudo , after  Leo  requests to and gives the design for it. It's blue, matching his Duel Disk.
 
 
 
 
 Luna's Duel Board . It was given to her by  Lester  as a gift, and was also rigged by him so that she would be forced to  Turbo Duel  against him. The back end of the board is colored pink, matching her Duel Disk.
 
 
 
 
 Lester's Duel Board . It was first seen in  episode 77 , when he uses it in a handicap Turbo Duel against Leo and Luna. It's designed so that the head and tail of the board resembles his " Meklord Emperor Skiel ". It is also the only Duel Board that is able to go as fast as a Duel Runner.
