 Wikipedia  has an article about  Yu-Gi-Oh! (Toei anime) . 
 
 
 Yu-Gi-Oh!  ( 遊☆戯☆王   Yūgiō , trans. "King of Games" is the first anime adaptation of the  Yu-Gi-Oh!  manga series . The 27-episode series was produced by  Toei Animation  and aired on  TV Asahi  from April 4 to October 10, 1998.
 While this series is not directly connected to  Yu-Gi-Oh! Duel Monsters  (known internationally simply as  Yu-Gi-Oh! , produced by  Nihon Ad Systems  and aired on  TV Tokyo ), both anime series are based on the  Yu-Gi-Oh!  manga.
 Manga plots were re-written so that they could take up an entire episode's worth of time. Also, the level of violence was reduced between the manga and the anime. Finally, a minor character in the manga,  Miho Nosaka , became a main character in the first series along with  Yugi Mutou ,  Katsuya Jonouchi ,  Anzu Mazaki , and  Hiroto Honda . Characterization was slightly modified. For instance, Miho is a "ditz" in the anime while in the manga she is a shy student librarian. Also, Honda is Jonouchi's verbal sparring partner instead of his crony in Toei's anime.
 New characters and plots, such as those relating to the four game masters, were added, and there are more occurrences of  Seto Kaiba  and  Duel Monsters  ( Magic and Wizards  in the original Japanese manga) than in the corresponding manga. Unlike the second series, the card game (Duel Monsters) is not the sole focus of the show. However, the Duel Monsters rules have been updated, becoming more like those used in the  Duelist Kingdom , even though this anime never gets to that point. The last episodes of the series focus on the battle between Yugi and  Dark Bakura . This series had different voice actors and different character designs than the second series (e.g. Seto Kaiba's hair is green in Toei's anime). The series has not been licensed for an English-language release.

 Shadow Games 
 In this series, Yami Yugi doesn't challenge people to a duel of  Duel Monsters . Instead, he would challenge them to a Shadow Game (Yami no Game in Japanese), a dangerous challenge where he would then explain the rules. However, the person in question would cheat and the Doors of Darkness will open, thus Yami Yugi would enact a  Penalty Game  upon the person, and usually whatever they obsess over the most would be their nightmare, such as their makeup falling off and showing their true face or wristwatches fusing to their being. Duel Monsters was not the main point of the show but was played a few times, and due to popular demand it subsequently became the main focus of the series.

 Trivia 
 Despite being his trump card in  the next series ,  Yugi  never played " Dark Magician " in this show. However, Yugi is seen using it in  the opening theme .
 " Dark Magician " is also seen in the hand of another duelist in episode 3. 
 Yugi  finally Summons " Dark Magician " in the  Toei Movie . 
 " Unguard Magic " (the  Toei  equivalent of " Stop Defense ") is the only card in English. 
 Kaiba  is seen with green hair and wears a white outfit like  Noah Kaiba  in the third season of  the next series . 
 Some manga chapters are packed together in one episode (eg. the three chapters with  Hirutani  occur in only one episode). 
 The  Millennium Items  are not gold-colored only. In fact, they are colored gold and brown (except for  Yugi 's  Puzzle ). 
 Most of the Shadow Games are changed, except for the  Dragon Card  against  Himori  and  Shadi 's tests. 
 Most of the  monsters  are colored differently, except for " Blue-Eyes White Dragon ". 
 The  card backings  show stylised "MW" letters for "Magic and Wizards", even though the characters refer to the game in-show as  Duel Monsters . 
 Cards are played on a duel mat with different areas depicted. All these areas give a 50% bonus to  monsters  placed in the right area.
 This is similar to the "field power bonus" in the Duelist Kingdom arc in  the next series . 
 Only a few duels use  Kaiba 's virtual reality system to show monsters. Other ideas used to show monsters are puppets, Shadow Games, etc.
