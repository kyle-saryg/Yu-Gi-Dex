 Dark Maneuvers...!! 
 
 "Rivals!!"  is the fourteenth chapter of the  Yu-Gi-Oh! 5D's  manga . 
 This chapter was first printed on September 21, 2010 in the 11/2010 issue of the  V Jump  magazine. It was later reprinted in the American  Shonen Jump  magazine, and in  volume 2  of the  tankōbon .
 As  Akiza  and  Sherry  put their differences aside and make-up after their Duel, the first round of the  D1 Grand Prix  continues on the second day. Many powerful opponents advance to the next round of the tournament, with the last match being between  Synchro  user  Crow Hogan  and Pro Duelist  Bolt Tanner .
 
 Summary 
 Mei  states that that's their Queen, and  Sakura  agrees that "Lady Akiza" is too splendid for words.  Yusei  congratulates her from the sidelines, and  Sect  comments that that was an awesome  Turbo Duel . Having just defeated  Sherry ,  Akiza  walks over to her. Sherry protests that Akiza ran away from  the Academy . How could she have lost to Akiza. Akiza admits that she ran away, and acknowledges that Duel Academy Sanctuary may foster elite Duelists, but even there, she could have enjoyed Dueling. She knows because Dueling Sherry proved it to her. Akiza holds out her hand, and Sherry seems bemused by the fact that a Turbo Duel can be fun. She decides that if the feeling can make elites stronger, then it may be worthy of consideration. She asks Akiza where she learned the trick of riding her  Duel Runner  with her eyes shut. Akiza loses her composure upon remembering the ordeal, and sinks to the ground, admitting that she had been desperate to beat Sherry's  Hand Scan . She can't believe it herself, and she'd never do that again. Sherry is surprised, and comments that Akiza hasn't changed; she's still as obstinate as ever. Akiza winks, claiming Sherry is just as stubborn, and the two girls laugh. Sherry tells Akiza that she had better win this, and Akiza replies that that's the plan. 
 
           Kalin  faces off against  Afro     
 The M.C. announces the second day of the tournament, stating that the first round is coming to a head. Sect stands with Yusei (not having ditched their cloaks), while Akiza watches with  Andre , and  Jack  watches from his box. Duel Security Rep  Tetsu Trudge  wins his Duel, saluting and commenting that no-one rigs Duels on his watch.  Hunter Pace  is displeased to see a cop. The "Handless Demon",  Kalin Kessler , defeats  Afro  with " Infernity General 's" direct attack, reducing Afro from 1000  Life Points  to zero, while his remain untouched. Kalin comments that Afro can't satisfy him, and looks up at Jack in the box as he murmers that only one person can satisfy him. Sect muses that every Turbo Duelist here is incredible, and Yusei agrees. 
 The duo are greeted (or rather, Yusei is greeted) by  the orange-haired, Marked man , who comments that he saw Yusei's first Duel, and claims that it psyched him up. He elbows Sect out of the way, commenting that  Synchro Monsters  are where it's at, he thinks that him and Yusei are going to get along. Sect angrily tells the Duelist to keep his grubby paws off Yusei, calling him "M-head" in reference to his Marks. The Duelist isn't happy, and angrily changes the subject, pointing out that Sect isn't even Dueling, telling him to get to the stands. Sect promptly refuses, stating that he isn't taking orders from "M-head". The M.C. announces the final Turbo Duel of the first round, and Yusei watches two wrestle, before asking who the Duelist is. The Duelist remembers that he hadn't introduced himself, dropping Sect, but the M.C. beats him to the punch, introducing him as  Crow Hogan  as he is announced to be facing  Bolt Tanner . Crow is estatic that it's finally his turn. He grins, telling Yusei to keep his eyes glued to his Turbo Duel; it's going to psych Yusei up. Sect just tells Crow to get out there and lose, calling him "M-head" again. 
 The Turbo Duel starts, and Tanner takes the first turn. Crow admits that Tanner's a Pro alright, as it isn't easy to get the jump on him like that. He congratulates him, and Tanner begins his turn, thinking that he's staked his honour as a Pro on the D1 Grand Prix - he can't lose. He sends four " Machina " monsters from his hand to the  Graveyard , Summoning his  ace monster , " Machina Cannon ", explaining that "Machina Cannon's"  ATK  is equal to the number of cards he sent to the Graveyard times 800, a total of 3200 ATK. As the M.C. commentates, Sect congratulates "Porcupine-head", telling "M-head" to lose. Akiza observes that this is a Pro, and Crow comments that he's kidding, right? It's only the first turn. Tanner Sets a card, and ends his turn, thinking that Crow can't touch him with " Mirror Force " Set. 
 Crow begins his turn, drawing a card. He looks at it, and then at his hand, thinking that if he's got this hand, he can... He  Normal Summons  the  Tuner monster , " Blackwing - Pinaka the Waxing Moon ", explaining that when it's destroyed, he can add " Blackwings " from his Graveyard to his hand. Yusei is shocked to see a Tuner monster, and Jack grins, realizing that Crow's a Synchro-user too. Crow then  Special Summons  " Blackwing - Kris the Crack of Dawn ", and " Blackwing - Gladius the Midnight Sun ", which he explains can be Special Summoned when there's a "Blackwing" on the field. Tanner doesn't care how many low-level monsters Crow Summons, but Akiza sees that Crow's aiming for a  Level 6  or  Level 7   Synchro Summon . Crow isn't done yet; since Tanner has a monster with at least 2000 ATK on his field, Crow can Special Summon the Tuner monster, " Blackwing - Sharnga the Waning Moon ." Sect is horrified to see Crow Summon four monsters in a single turn, and Yusei realizes what Crow's doing. Crow tunes the  Level 2  Tuner, "Sharnga the Waning Moon" with the  Level 3  "Gladius the Midnight Sun", as well as tuning the Level 3 Tuner monster, "Pinaka the Waxing Moon" with the  Level 4  "Kris the Crack of Dawn". Yusei is shocked that Crow is Synchro Summoning two Synchro Monsters at once, as is Jack, who rises from his couch as  Goodwin  and  Mina  observe. Crow declares "Double Synchro Summon" as he Synchro Summons " Blackwing Tamer - Obsidian Hawk Joe ", and " Blackwing - Gram the Shining Star ". Then he activates a  Trap Card  from his hand, " Black-Winged Arrow ", which he can activate when he has at least four "Blackwings" in his Graveyard, allowing him to negate the effect of "Machina Cannon". A black quill punctures "Machina Cannon", and with its effect negated, its ATK returns to zero. Crow orders both of his monsters to attack, and Tanner frantically activates his "Mirror Force", but Crow activates the  Spell card , " Black Cyclone " from his hand, which becomes a  Quick-Play Spell Card  when he's got a " Blackwing Tamer " on the field. It negates "Mirror Force", and Tanner can only think of his professional honour before Crows monsters attack him and "Machina Cannon", wiping out his Life Points. The M.C. announces Crow the winner, and comments in shock that Crow pulled off the first  One Turn Kill  of the tournament. He tells the crowd that that was the Duelist nicknamed the "Black Whirlwind", Crow Hogan. Jack gets up and leaves the box, reflecting that apparently, the D1 Grand Prix won't bore him at all. 
 Sect is shocked at how good Crow is, and Crow calls out to Yusei from the track, holding up his "super-fast Synchro Deck". He states that he's looking forward to their Turbo Duel, and Yusei thinks that Crow has surpassed his own high-speed Synchro. He thinks that Crow is a Duelist who uses a super-fast Synchro Deck, with an emphasis on Special Summons. He comments that this should be good, and tells Crow to bring it on. The M.C. announces the end of the first round.
 
 Featured Duel: Crow Hogan vs. Bolt Tanner 
 Turn 1: Tanner 
Tanner  discards  " Machina Soldier ", " Machina Defender ", " Machina Sniper " and another unspecified " Machina "  monster  to  Special Summon  " Machina Cannon " (0/2200) from his  hand  in  Attack Position , via its own  effect ; its  ATK  increases by 800 for each  monster   discarded  (0/2200 → 3200/2200). He  Sets  " Mirror Force ".
 Turn 2: Crow 
Crow  Normal Summons  " Blackwing - Pinaka the Waxing Moon " (1200/1000). As he  controls  a " Blackwing " monster, he Special Summons " Blackwing - Kris the Crack of Dawn " (1900/300) and " Blackwing - Gladius the Midnight Sun " (800/1500) from his hand. Then, because his opponent controls a monster with 2000 or more ATK, he Special Summons " Blackwing - Sharnga the Waning Moon " (500/500) from his  hand .
 Crow tunes "Sharnga the Waning Moon" and "Gladius the Midnight Sun" to  Synchro Summon  " Blackwing - Gram the Shining Star " (2200/1500), and then Tunes "Pinaka the Waxing Moon" and "Kris the Crack of Dawn" to Synchro Summon " Blackwing Tamer - Obsidian Hawk Joe " (2600/2000), both in Attack Position. 
 Because he now has 4 "Blackwings" in his  Graveyard , Crow  activates  " Black-Winged Arrow " from his hand,  negating  the effect of Tanner's "Machina Cannon", and thus reducing its ATK to 0.
 Crow  attacks  with "Obsidian Hawk Joe" and "Gram the Shining Star", but Tanner activates "Mirror Force". Crow activates " Black Cyclone " from his  hand  because he controls a " Blackwing Tamer " monster, negating "Mirror Force" and  destroying  it. "Machina Cannon" is destroyed and Tanner takes a total of 4800  damage  (Tanner 4000 → 0).
 Crow wins in an  One Turn Kill .
