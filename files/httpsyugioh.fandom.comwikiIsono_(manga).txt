 Biography 
 Battle City 
 At  Domino Stadium , Isono welcomed people who qualified for the  Battle City  finals and issued them their I.D. cards, including  Marik Ishtar , under the alias "Namu",  Rishid , under the guise of Marik,  Seto Kaiba ,  Katsuya Jonouchi ,  Yugi Mutou ,  Mai Kujaku  and  Ryo Bakura . [1]  With the cut off time for the finalists arrivals approaching, he proceeded to disclose the true location of the finals, the  Battle Ship  blimp. He attempted to stop Yugi and Jonouchi's companions from boarding, since they did not have I.D. cards, but  Mokuba Kaiba  overruled him, while pointing out that Mokuba, himself also did have an I.D. card. With cut off time almost reached, he was about the board the blimp himself and continue the tournament, assuming the eight finalist was not going to show up. However  Ishizu Ishtar  arrived just in time and he accepted her as the last finalist. [2] 
 One hour after the finalists were shown their rooms on the blimp, Isono instructed them to gather in the central assembly hall, where he unveiled the  Ultimate Bingo machine , which was to determine the match-ups for the quarterfinals. Using it he announced Bakura and Yugi as the first pairing. [3]  Isono served as referee during  the Duel [4]  and when  Dark Yugi  was reluctant to attack the injured Bakura, reminded him of the five-minute time limit Duelists had each turn. [5]  After announcing Yugi as the winner, he had the first-aid kit brought out for Bakura, following Mokuba's instructions. He reminded Yugi that he was permitted to take one of Bakura's cards, per the  ante rule , but Yugi was more concerned about Bakura's safety. [6] 
 Isono announced the bingo draw for  the second quarterfinal , matching Jonouchi and Rishid, still posing as Marik. [6]  As the participants shuffled each others Decks, he was flustered by Jonouchi's intimidating stare-down at Rishid and instructed him to back down and return to his Dueling position. [7]  When Jonouchi and Rishid fell unconscious, he refused access to  the Dueling platform  for Jonouchi's friends, since the Duel was not over. He ruled that the first player to stand up would be the winner, having displayed the greater willingness to continue. He enforced a time limit, after which both would be disqualified, [8]  but eventually declared Jonouchi the winner. [9] 
 Isono announced the final bingo draw, which selected Mai Kujaku and Marik Ishtar, now  Dark Marik , for  the third quarterfinal . [10]  He refused allow the Dueling platform to be lowered, when Mai's life was in danger. But Jonouchi pushed him aside and tried to operate the controls, despite Isono's warning of disqualification. Jonouchi and Dark Yugi both disregarded his orders and climbed into the arena to help Mai. [11]  Stunned by the recent events, he forgot to declare Dark Marik the winner, until prompted by Dark Marik, himself. [12] 
 
 Project R.A. 
 The Dark Side of Dimensions 
 Before Kaiba departed to his space station, he instructed Isono to plan a Duel exhibition while he was away, so that he could showcase his new  Duel Disk  when he returned. [13]
