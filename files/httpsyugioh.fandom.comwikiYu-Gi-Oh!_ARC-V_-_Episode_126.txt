 Differences in adaptations 
 During the flashback scene, there is a silhouette of a duelist coughing out blood after his monster was stabbed by Beast King Barbaros. In the English Dub, this scene was removed. 
 One of the poses made by the holographic woman with the car is cut from the dub. 
 All scenes of Z-ARC's attack on the Original Dimension are given a purple filter in the dub. 
 Leo's comments, one made when Z-ARC reveals that he will destroy the world just before summoning his Four Dragons and just before Z-ARC and the Four Dragons fuse together are cut from the dub. 
 Leo's voiceover describing Supreme King Z-ARC's power while Yuya is screaming in anger is left out in the dub. 
 Z-ARC's desire for power is changed to a desire for a greater challenge in the dub. 
 Trivia 
 Surprisingly, this episode's violent content was left largely unaltered in the dub, save for a couple of scenes. In the end of the dubbed version of the episode, Leo makes a direct reference to death (a extremely rare occurrence in Yu-Gi-Oh!'s US English Dubs), saying that he was willing to pay with his life to stop Z-ARC. Similar references are made in the dubbed version of the following episode. 
 Mistakes 
 The eye of " Odd-Eyes Dragon " is sometimes colored in yellow instead of green. 
 When  Z-ARC  is talking to the Four Dimension Dragons, his  Duel Disk  has " Odd-Eyes Pendulum Dragon " on it instead of "Odd-Eyes Dragon".(this was corrected in the dub) 
 The card text of " Astrograph Sorcerer " included the name "Odd-Eyes Pendulum Dragon", which is impossible as "Odd-Eyes Pendulum Dragon" hadn't been created at that point.
