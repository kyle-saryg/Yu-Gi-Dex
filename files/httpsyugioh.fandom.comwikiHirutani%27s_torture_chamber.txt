 Features 
 The warehouse's most disturbing feature is the hook hanging from an overhead girder. The gang uses it to tie people's hands over their head. [1]  They once hung Yugi there by the neck, using the rope around his  Millennium Puzzle .
 
 Manga events 
 After Jonouchi, who was forced back into the gang, got into a fight with  another member  of the gang, Hirutani order the rest of the gang to seize Jonouchi and bring him to the torture chamber. Once there, they tied his hands to the hook and attacked him with stun guns. However Jonouchi managed to kick  one of the members  away, knocking him unconscious. [2] [1] 
 Dark Yugi  arrived while Jonouchi was barely conscious. He allowed himself to be hit by  a gangster , so he could secretly set up a trap; He lured the gang into a puddle and as he stood up, he covertly put a metal bar under the unconscious member's arm and hung the  Millennium Puzzle  over his forehead. Dark Yugi then challenged the gang to  a game , where the gang must find a switch to a time bomb before it goes off. The gang failed to find the true switch; Rainwater trickled down the Millennium Puzzle and onto the unconscious member, waking him up, causing him to move his arm suspended on the metal bar, hence dropping his stun gun into the puddle and electrocuting the gang. [1] 
 Yugi and Jonouchi were lured into the torture chamber a second time by  Nezumi . This time, Jonouchi caught a number of the gangsters'  yo-yos  on the rope from Yugi's Puzzle and hung them from the hook by their fingers. Dark Yugi caused the remaining gangsters to fall through a rooftop, while Jonouchi fought Hirutani.
 
 Anime events
