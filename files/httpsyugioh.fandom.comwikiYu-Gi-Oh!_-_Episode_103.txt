 Summary 
 Kaiba  and  Mokuba  find another projection of their past through a virtual door, this time showing their life with  Gozaburo . Kaiba was forced to overwork in his studies. When his toys were taken away, Mokuba saved his  Duel Monsters  cards and tried to cheer him up by sneaking them to him along with a drawing of a " Blue-Eyes White Dragon " card. In the present day,  Noah  mocks the brothers. 
 Yugi  and  Yami Yugi  work out how to progress in the maze. They can hear that  Téa  is in trouble in her Duel.
 Yugi realizes that the key to proceeding is to defeat monsters in each doorway in increasing order of strength. He and Yami Yugi have limited resources available, so they conserve their very best cards and use adapting tactics. 
 Téa uses " Maha Vailo " (a card she remembers Yugi showing her) to gain an advantage, but  Crump  defeats it quickly.
 She has no monsters left. Her  Deck Master , " Dark Magician Girl ," volunteers to be summoned, and Téa heeds this advice. 
 Crump admits that "Dark Magician Girl" could be a threat if " Dark Magician " were to join her, but Téa's reaction to this comment reveals that she never put that monster into her Deck. 
 Yugi reaches the Duel, but he is trapped behind ice and can only watch as Téa comes closer to defeat. 
 In her last effort, Téa uses her Deck Master's ability, draining her  Graveyard  to draw cards in hopes of getting the first card she put in her Deck: " Sage's Stone ." She gets it, and its effect summons "Dark Magician" from Yugi's nearby Deck. When "Dark Magician" breaks through the ice to join "Dark Magician Girl," Yugi is able to encourage Téa. 
 Both Magicians attack, destroying Crump's defense and  Life Points  in one turn. Téa wins and is reunited with Yugi. 
 Featured Duels 
 Téa Gardner vs. Crump 
 Duel continues from  the previous episode . 
 Téa has 2250  Life Points  remaining and controls no cards.
 Crump has 2200 Life Points remaining and controls "Flying Penguin" (2200/1000) in Attack Position and " Penguin Sword " (which is equipped to "Flying Penguin").
 Turn 7: Téa 
 Téa  skips her  Draw Phase  due to the  effect  of " Offerings to the Doomed ". She  Sets  a  monster .
 Turn 8: Crump 
Crump draws "Bolt Penguin" while his  hand  contains "Defender Iceberg" and "Penguin Torpedo". " Flying Penguin "  attacks  and  destroys  Téa's Set monster, " Skelengel " (900/400). The  Flip Effect  of "Skelengel"  activates , allowing Téa to  draw  a card (" Magic Formula ").
 Turn 9: Téa 
Téa draws " Maha Vailo " and subsequently Normal Summons it (1550/1400) in  Attack Position . She then activates " Magic Formula ",  equipping  it to "Maha Vailo" and increasing its ATK by 500 (1550 → 2050). Since "Maha Vailo" is equipped with an  Equip Magic Card , it gains 500 ATK due to its own effect (2050 → 2550). "Maha Vailo" attacks and destroys "Flying Penguin" (Crump 2200 → 1850).
 Turn 10: Crump 
Crump Normal Summons " Bolt Penguin " (1100/800) in  Defense Position  and Sets one card.
 Turn 11: Téa 
"Maha Vailo" attacks and destroys "Bolt Penguin". As a monster Crump  controls  was  destroyed by battle , he activates his  face-down  " Revenge Sacrifice " to  Tribute  "Maha Vailo" and Special Summon " Defender Iceberg " (0 → 200/2450) from his hand in Defense Position.
 Turn 12: Crump 
Crump Sets a card. He then Normal Summons " Penguin Torpedo " in (550 → 750/500) Attack Position. "Penguin Torpedo" attacks  directly  (Téa 2250 → 1500) via its own effect. Since "Penguin Torpedo" attacked directly through its own effect, its second effect destroys it at the end of the  Damage Step .
 Turn 13: Téa 
Téa draws " Michizure ", while her hand contains " Graceful Charity ". Téa moves her  Deck Master , " Dark Magician Girl ", to the field (2000/1700) in Attack Position.
 Turn 14: Crump 
Crump activates his face-down " Ocean of Regeneration " to revive "Penguin Torpedo" (550 → 750/500) in Attack Position, however "Penguin Torpedo" will be destroyed during the  End Phase  and Crump may not Normal Summon or Set a monster this turn. "Penguin Torpedo" attacks directly via its own effect (Téa 1500 → 750). "Penguin Torpedo" is destroyed at the end of the Damage Step due to its second effect. 
 
       Téa’s body covered in ice as her life points near zero.     
 Turn 15: Téa 
Téa activates her Deck Master Ability, letting her  reveal  a card from the top of her  Deck  for each monster in her Graveyard and then  add  one of them to her  hand . Her Graveyard contains four monsters - " Ancient Elf ", " Fire Sorcerer ", "Skelengel" and "Maha Vailo" and she reveals " Sage's Stone ", " Gemini Elf ", " Polymerization " and an unspecified fourth card. Téa adds "Sage's Stone" to her hand. She then activates "Sage's Stone", which is placed in one Monster Card Zone and treated as "Dark Magician" (2500/2100) in Attack Position (this is depicted as Yugi's " Dark Magician " coming out of his deck and being summoned to Téa's side of the field). "Dark Magician" attacks and destroys "Defender Iceberg". "Dark Magician Girl" then attacks directly (Crump 1850 → 0).
 
 Doorway Puzzle 
 Duel continues from  the previous episode .   
 Level 2  -  Yugi  Summons " Obnoxious Celtic Guardian " (1400/1200) and  attacks  the hidden  monster , " Firegrass " (700/600). "Obnoxious Celtic Guardian"  destroys  "Firegrass". 
 Level 3  - As Yugi has no other cards in his  hand , he  Normal Summons  " Swift Gaia the Fierce Knight " in Attack Position without  Tributing  via its own  effect . "Swift Gaia" attacks the hidden monster, but a glyph on the door disappears and the door subsequently activates " Mirror Force " to destroy "Swift Gaia". Yugi Summons " Gazelle the King of Mythical Beasts " (1500/1200). The hidden monster, " Dark King of the Abyss " (1200/800), appears. However another glyph disappears and the door activates " Sword of Dark Destruction ", equipping it to "Dark King of the Abyss", increasing its  ATK  by 400, and decreasing its  DEF  by 200 ("Dark King of the Abyss": 1200 → 1600/800 → 600). Yugi Summons " Berfomet " (1400/1800) and activates " Polymerization " to  fuse  his two monsters and  Fusion Summon  " Chimera the Flying Mythical Beast " (2100/1800). "Chimera" attacks and destroys "Dark King of the Abyss". 
 Level 4  - Yugi draws " Dark Magician ". Yugi draws " Heavy Storm " and subsequently activates it to destroy all five Set cards and prompts the glyphs on the door to vanish. The hidden monster, " Flash Assailant " (2000/2000), appears. Yugi Summons " 4-Starred Ladybug of Doom " (800/1200). "4-Starred Ladybug of Doom" and "Flash Assailant" battle. "Flash Assailant" destroys "4-Starred Ladybug of Doom", but this activates the latter's effect, destroying "Flash Assailant" as it was a Level 4 monster.
 
 Differences in adaptations 
 In the Japanese version,  Hobson , the Kaiba family butler, wakes  Kaiba  during his lessons by rapping a switchblade across the books in front of him. The switchblade is removed from the dub. 
 A shot of a long table laden with food, and young Kaiba and  Mokuba  sitting quietly across from each other, is cut from the dub. 
 " Revenge Sacrifice " has been redesigned in the dub to remove the red tentacles binding the woman. 
 Errors 
 When discussing what to do with what was left of their Deck to get through the 4 star door,  Yami Yugi  refers to the door as having four face-down cards despite having just stated that it had five.
