 Featured Duel: Aster Phoenix and Sora Perse vs. Z-ARC 
       Z-ARC  VS  Aster  &  Sora     
 Turn 1: Z-ARC 
Z-ARC activates " Supreme King Gate Zero " (   0) and " Supreme King Gate Infinity " (   13) in his  Pendulum Zones . He  Pendulum Summons  two copies of " Supreme King Dragon Darkwurm " (1800/1200), both in  Attack Position .
 Turn 2: Aster 
Aster activates " Polymerization ",  fusing  " Destiny HERO - Drilldark " and " Destiny HERO - Decider " in his hand to  Fusion Summon  " Destiny HERO - Dystopia " (2800/2400) in Attack Position.  Aster activates the effect "Dystopia" as it was Fusion Summoned to inflict damage to Z-ARC equal to the ATK of one of its Fusion Materials. Aster targets "Decider". The  Pendulum Effect  of "Zero" reduces any damage Z-ARC would take to 0, and the Pendulum effect of "Infinity" increases Z-ARC's LP by the same amount Z-ARC would've taken without "Zero" (4000 → 5600 LP). "Dystopia"  attacks  a "Darkwurm", but Z-ARC activates the effect of "Darkwurm", letting him negate an attack once per turn as he controls another "Supreme King" monster. Aster activates " D - Soul Burst ", halving the ATK of a "Destiny HERO" monster he controls and inflicting the lost ATK as  damage  to all players. He targets "Dystopia" ("Dystopia" 2800 → 1400). The Pendulum Effects of "Zero" and "Infinity" reduce the damage Z-ARC takes to 0 and increase his LP by the same amount (Z-ARC 5600 → 7000) (Aster 4000 → 2600). As its ATK or DEF was changed, Aster activates the effect of "Dystopia", letting him  destroy  a card on the field. He destroys a "Darkwurm". Aster  Sets  a card.
 Turn 3: Sora 
Sora activates " Frightfur Sanctuary " by  sending  a card from his hand and two " Frightfur " monsters from his  Extra Deck  to the  Graveyard . He sends " Edge Imp Frightfuloid " in his hand and " Frightfur Bear " and " Frightfur Tiger " in his Extra Deck to the Graveyard. While active, "Sanctuary" allows Sora to treat all Fusion Monsters he controls as "Frightfur" monsters. He then activates " Frightfur Fusion " to Fusion Summon a " Frightfur " Monster by banishing its Fusion Materials from his side of the field or his Graveyard. He banishes "Frightfuloid", treated as a "Frightfur" monster by its own effect, "Bear", and "Tiger" from his Graveyard to Fusion Summon " Frightfur Chimera " (2800/2000) in Attack Position. "Chimera" attacks and destroys "Darkwurm". The Pendulum Effects of "Zero" and "Infinity" reduce the damage to 0 and increase Z-ARC's LP by the same amount (Z-ARC 7000 → 8000). Sora Sets a card.
 Turn 4: Z-ARC 
Z-ARC Pendulum Summons the two copies of "Darkwurm" (1800/1200) from his Extra Deck in Attack Position. As a monster was Special Summoned alongside another Special Summoned monster while Aster controls a " Destiny HERO " monster, Aster activates his Set " D - Hyper Nova ", destroying all monsters that were Special Summoned this turn. As a card or effect that would destroy an opponent's monster was activated while he controls a face-up " Frightfur " monster, Sora activates his Set " Frightfur Mad Parade ", destroying all cards on Z-ARC's field and inflicting 500 damage to him for each monster destroyed. "Zero", "Infinity", and the two "Darkwurm" are destroyed (Z-ARC 8000 → 6000). As his cards were destroyed, Z-ARC activates the effect of " Astrograph Sorcerer " in his hand,  Special Summoning  it (2500/2000) in Attack Position and returning all cards destroyed this turn in the same Zone they were in before they were destroyed. Z-ARC places "Zero" (   0) and "Infinity" (   13) back in his Pendulum Zones and Special Summons the two copies of "Darkwurm". Z-ARC activates the second effect of "Astrograph Sorcerer", letting him  banish  " Dark Rebellion Xyz Dragon ", " Clear Wing Synchro Dragon ", " Starving Venom Fusion Dragon ", and " Odd-Eyes Pendulum Dragon " from his  Deck , Extra Deck, field, and Graveyard to  Integration Summon  " Supreme King Z-ARC " from his Extra Deck (4000/4000) in Attack Position.
 At this point,  Shay Obsidian  and  Kite Tenjo  join the Duel, taking the intrusion penalty (Shay: 4000 → 2000 LP; Kite: 4000 → 2000 LP). With Shay joining the Duel, the  Field Spell Card  " Crossover " is  activated , as per the rules of an  Action Duel . It will allow the players to use  Action Cards , but they may only have one in their  hand  at a time.
 As "Z-ARC" was Summoned, its effect activates, destroying all monsters Sora and Aster control and inflicting damage to them equal to the total ATK of the monsters destroyed, but "Z-ARC" cannot attack the turn this effect was activated. "Dystopia" and "Chimera" are destroyed (Aster 2600 → 0, Sora 4000 → 0).
 Duel continues in the next episode .

 Trivia 
 In the dub, when Aster Phoenix and Sora Perse started their Duel against Z-ARC, the computer in their Duel Disks stated that " Crossover " has been activated. Originally, Aster and Sora didn't have "Crossover" available, and it was activated when  Shay  and  Kite  joined the Duel. 
 Errors 
   An error with Z-ARC not on the dragon.   Z-ARC, merged. 1/2 
 In the shot showing the ATK gauge of "Supreme King Z-ARC", Z-ARC is not on his monster's "neck pedestal", yet after the view is done focusing on his card, he is. 
 When Sora Fusion Summoned Frightfur Chimera he states that his monster had destroyed a bunch of Yuya's monster before but has never actually summoned this monster against Yuya.
