 <poem>
Egao ga soko ni aru kagiri
Wana kīpu on shainin'!
Kyūkyoku no Puraido kakete
Wana bī za pāfekuto
Don'na toki mo shinjiteru
Jibun no ashita wo
Ima yūki no tsubasa de Jasuto furai awei!
Wī ā fyūchā faitāzu!
Kono tamashī no dyueru (Yami wo kirisake kiseki no Kādo!)
Butsukari au jikū koeta batoru (Otanoshimi wa kore kara da!)
Sorezore no yume wo te ni ireru tame ni
Ikuze saikyō no mirai
Nebagiba! Nebagiba!!
 
Nebagiba!!! Nebagiba!!!! 
 
 As long as those smiles are there 
Wanna keep on shinin'! 
I'll stake it all on my ultimate pride 
Wanna be the perfect 
No matter when, we'll believe 
In our tomorrow 
Now, on wings of courage, Just fly away! 
We are future fighters! 
This duel of the soul (Slice through the darkness, card of miracles!) 
Clash heads in the battle that transcends space and time (The real fun's just getting started!) 
For our dreams to gather within our hands 
Let's go, towards the ultimate future 
Never give up! Never give up!! 
Never give up!!! Never give up!!!!
