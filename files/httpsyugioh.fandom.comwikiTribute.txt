 Tribute , called  Release  (Japanese: リリース   Rirīsu ) in the  OCG  and the post- Yu-Gi-Oh! GX  anime series, refers to a method of  sending  a  monster (s) the player  controls  to the  Graveyard . It was previously referred to as to  offer as a Tribute  in the  TCG , called  offer as a Sacrifice  ( 生 け 贄 に 捧 げる  Ikenie ni Sasageru ) in the  OCG  and the  Yu-Gi-Oh!  and  Yu-Gi-Oh! GX  anime series.
 Monsters can be Tributed in two ways:
 
 As requirement for a  Tribute Summon / Set . 
 By card that specifically uses this term (as a  cost ,  effect , or as part of a  Summoning condition ). 
 Unless a card specifically states that you can Tribute monsters in your  hand  or under your opponent's control, such as " Forbidden Arts of the Gishki " and " Reptilianne Vaskii ", you can only Tribute monsters you control (on the field). 
 While normally only monsters can be Tributed, some cards, such as " True Draco and True King " cards and " Kiryu ", can Tribute  Spell  and  Trap Cards .
 Tributed cards do not need to end up in the Graveyard to still be considered Tributed. For example, Tributed cards  banished  by the effect of " Macro Cosmos " will still be considered to be Tributed, so the cost of cards such as " Horn of Heaven " can still be paid while "Macro Cosmos" is active.
