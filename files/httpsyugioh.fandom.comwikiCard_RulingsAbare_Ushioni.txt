 OCG Rulings 
 An example of using the effect of " Lucky Chance ": the effect of " Abare Ushioni " activates, and then the effect of " Lucky Chance " is  chained .  First, you resolve " Lucky Chance " and declare "tails".  Next, the effect of " Abare Ushioni " resolves.  The coin lands on "tails", so after resolving the effect of " Abare Ushioni " you draw 1 card. [1] 
 Previously Official Rulings 
   These TCG rulings were issued by  Upper Deck Entertainment  and have since been deemed unofficial by Konami. [2]  They were previously considered official and can still be correct, as long as they follow the official gameplay rules, or unless Konami has issued a ruling that says otherwise. References:  [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] 
 
 If you call the coin toss wrong for “ Abare Ushioni ” you can still prevent the  damage  with “ Pikeru’s Circle of Enchantment ”, etc. 
 You cannot  chain  “ Barrel Behind the Door ” to the effect of “ Abare Ushioni ” because you don’t know yet if you will take  damage  or not from the effect.
