 OCG Rulings 
 When " Necrovalley " is not on the field when " A Cat of Ill Omen " activates, you must put the card on top of your deck. [1] 
 If " Necrovalley " is on the field when " A Cat of Ill Omen " activates, then at activation you must select whether to add the card to your hand or to put it on top of your deck. [1] 
 You must show the Trap Card to your opponent to verify it. [1] 
 Previously Official Rulings 
   These TCG rulings were issued by  Upper Deck Entertainment  and have since been deemed unofficial by Konami. [2]  They were previously considered official and can still be correct, as long as they follow the official gameplay rules, or unless Konami has issued a ruling that says otherwise. References:  [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] 
 
 Show the card to your opponent. 
 If " Imperial Order " & " Necrovalley " are both active, and " A Cat of Ill Omen " is  flipped , you add the card to your  hand  because " Necrovalley " is  face-up  on the  field , even though its effect is  negated . 
 If " Mystical Space Typhoon " is  chained  to the effect to  destroy  " Necrovalley ", so that " Necrovalley " is not on the field when this effect  resolves , you cannot place the card in your  hand . 
 You select the card for this effect when the effect  resolves , not when it  activates . 
 Mentions in Other Rulings 
 Pharaoh's Treasure : You can select a face-up " Pharaoh's Treasure " from your deck with " Cat of Ill Omen "  [ sic ] ; if " Necrovalley " is not on the field, the " Pharaoh's Treasure " is placed face-up on top of your Deck and will activate its effect when drawn.
