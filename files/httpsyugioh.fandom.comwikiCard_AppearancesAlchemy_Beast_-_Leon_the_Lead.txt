 In  episode 45 ,  Amnael  uses this card during his duel against  Jaden Yuki . He summons this card via " Lead Compass ". On Amnael's next turn, this card, " Alchemy Beast - Salamandra the Steel " and " Alchemy Beast - Ouroboros the Bronze " attack directly via their own effects. Amnael then activates " Black Process - Negledo " to banish this card, "Salamandra the Steel" and "Ouroboros the Bronze" from the field and draw six cards (two cards for each Alchemy Beast banished). In  the next episode , this card is shown when Amnael counts up the number of banished monsters for the effect of " Helios Duo Megistus ". After Jaden summons " Elemental HERO Electrum ", the latter's effect returns all banished monsters to their owners' Decks. 
 Its attack in the Japanese version was known as  Leo Vulcan .
