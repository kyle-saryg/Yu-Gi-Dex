 " Rainbow Dark Dragon " (in both the anime artwork and the OCG/TCG artwork) and the " Advanced Crystal Beast " monsters are featured in the artwork of the card. 
 After being shown on  Yu-Gi-Oh! GX , it was 2 generations later ( Yu-Gi-Oh! 5D's  and  Yu-Gi-Oh! ZEXAL ) before this card and " Miracle Contact " were released to the OCG/TCG.
