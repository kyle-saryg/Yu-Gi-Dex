 Special Summon  ( 特 殊 召 喚   Tokushu Shōkan ) is any  Summon  other than  Normal Summon  or  Flip Summon . They only occur due to game mechanics,  card effect  or  Summoning condition .
 There is no restriction on the number of times a player can Special Summon in a turn—Special Summons do not take up the  turn player 's Normal Summon/ Set . Also, unless otherwise specified, Special Summoning does not require  Tributes  for high- Level  monsters.
 Ritual Summons ,  Fusion Summons ,  Synchro Summons ,  Xyz Summons ,  Pendulum Summons , and  Link Summons  are all considered Special Summons.

 Special Summon types 
 There are two different types of Special Summon. The type indicates which cards and effects can respond to or negate the Special Summon. Cards printed with  Problem-Solving Card Text  can easily have their method of Special Summon determined: effects that contain a colon or semicolon are Special Summons due to a card effect (and thus start a  Chain ), and cards that are not built-in Special Summons.
 
 Built-in Special Summon 
 Built-in Special Summons  (also unofficially known as  inherent Special Summons ) are Special Summons that are done by a game mechanics, or the monsters' own  Summoning condition  (e.g.  Contact Fusion ) or  Summon effect . These Special Summons  do not  start a chain.
 Normally, the player can only perform such a Summon during an open  game state  in their  Main Phase . They are never performed as part of an  effect   resolution ; effects that cause the player to perform one of these Summons instead have the player perform the Summon immediately after they resolve (e.g. " Formula Synchron ", " Advanced Heraldry Art "), or are actually Special Summons with a card effect that treat the Summon as a Built-in Special Summon (e.g. " Rank-Up-Magic ").
 There are two sub-types of Built-in Special Summon: Summon by conditions and by effect that does not activate.
 
 By Condition 
         Photon Thrasher     
 Japanese:  条 件 による 特 殊 召 喚  ( Jōken ni yoru Tokushu Shōkan )
 These Special Summon are exclusive for Special Summon Monsters. Special Summon monsters must be Summoned by following their condition(s) first to be considered properly Special Summoned.
 These Special Summons are not card's effect, so cards like " Vampire Grace " cannot be used. 
 Synchro Summons ,  Xyz Summons ,  Pendulum Summons ,  Link Summons  and  Contact Fusions  are all considered Special Summons By Condition. In addition, all  Nomi  and  Semi-Nomi  monsters (collectively known in Japanese as "Special Summon monster") are summoned wih their Summoning conditions.
 
 By Effect that does not activate 
         Cyber Dragon     
 Main article:  Summon effect 
 Japanese:  発 動 しない 効 果 による 特 殊 召 喚  ( Hatsudō-shinai Kōka ni yoru Tokushu Shōkan )
 Summon monster effects are effect that present on  Normal Summon Monsters , so that they can also be Special Summoned. These Special Summons are optional.
 These effects are  Unclassified Effect , as they do not activate (like  Ignition  or  Trigger ), and they are not  Continuous Effects .
 
 Special Summon with a card effect 
 Japanese:  発 動 する 効 果 による 特 殊 召 喚  ( Hatsudō-suru Kōka ni yoru Tokushu Shōkan )
 Special Summons with a card effect  are any Special Summon that occurs during the  resolution  of an  activated  card effect (e.g. " Monster Reborn " and " Gorz the Emissary of Darkness ").  Ritual Summons  and  Fusion Summons  are both types of Special Summoning with a card effect.
 These Special Summons cannot be negated. However, they can be prevented from occurring in the first place by negating the effect that would perform the Special Summon, and/or the activation itself.
 While they are rare, Special Summons as the result of an  activated  card or effect that do not occur during that effect's resolution, except Synchro, Xyz and Link Summons, also fall into this category. Cards such as " Revival Jam " and " Memory of an Adversary " can perform this kind of Special Summon.
 Some effects that Special Summon can  ignore the Summoning conditions  of the Summoned monster, allowing it to Special Summon monsters regardless of their  Summoning conditions .
 
 Summon response window 
 Main article:  Summon response window 
 The Summon response window is an unofficial term used to describe the timing in which cards and effects can be activated in  response  to a successful Summon. Cards and effects that can be activated in response to a successful Special Summon, such as " Torrential Tribute " and " Bottomless Trap Hole ", can be activated after any of these Special Summons, regardless of whether it is built-in or with a card effect. However, they cannot be activated if a monster is Special Summoned by a card effect that is  Chain Link  2 or higher, unless the activation of all other cards and effects that would resolve after it are negated. This is because cards and effects cannot be activated in the middle of a resolving Chain, and whichever effect resolves last (as Chain Link 1) would cause these cards to  miss the timing .
 Furthermore, if the card effect that Special Summoned the monster performed another action during its resolution after Special Summoning the monster (e.g. " Magical Dimension ", " Drill Warrior ", " Telekinetic Power Well ", " Trojan Gladiator Beast ", etc.), then this window does not occur and any cards that can be activated in response to a Summon  miss the timing .
