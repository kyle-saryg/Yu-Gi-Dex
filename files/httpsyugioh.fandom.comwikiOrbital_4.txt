      Orbital 4 in orbit.     
 Orbital 4  is a satellite controlled by  Orbital 7 . 
 After falling in love with  Lilly , Orbital 7 erroneously believed that she was being treated as a slave by  Yuma Tsukumo . To win her freedom, Orbital 7 challenged Yuma to a  Duel , but loses. Having expected this as a possible outcome, Orbital 7 then ordered Orbital 4 to fire its laser from orbit at Yuma, but Lilly is nearly caught in the blast. Orbital 7 managed to push her to safety, leaving only Yuma to be hit by the beam. The explosion left a crater in the ground, but outside of minor burns and having his hair charred into an afro, Yuma is not seriously harmed. [1]
