 Featured Duel: Katsuya Jonouchi VS Mendo Cino 
 Duel continues from  the previous chapter . 
 Turn 9: Mendo 
During the  Standby Phase , " Mantis Egg "  Special Summons  a " Baby Mantis Token " (500/500).  Mendo   Tributes  his two "Baby Mantis Tokens" via the  effect  of " Dreadscythe Harvester " to increases its  ATK  by the ATK of the Tributed  monsters . Its ATK increases from 2300 to 3300. "Dreadscythe Harvester"  attacks  " Jinzo ", but  Jonouchi   activates  his  face-down  " Shield & Sword ", swapping the ATK and  DEF  of both monsters ("Jinzo": ATK 1500/DEF 2400) ("Harvester": ATK 1600/DEF 3300). "Jinzo" is  destroyed . Jonouchi activates his face-down " Time Machine ", negating the Battle Damage that he would of received and Special Summoning "Jinzo" from his  Graveyard  as it was during the start of this turn. Thus, its ATK and DEF stats are returned to normal. The battle with "Dreadscythe Harvester" is repeated and the latter card is destroyed (Mendo 3000 → 2200). Mendo  Normal Summons  " Guard Mantis " (1000/2400) in  Defense Position ,  paying  1000  Life Points  via " Labor Pain " (Mendo 2200 → 1200).
 Turn 10: Jonouchi 
Jonouchi activates " Stop Defense ", switching "Guard Mantis" to Attack Position. "Jinzo" attacks and destroys "Guard Mantis" (Mendo 1200 → 0).
