 Format 
 Dark Duel Stories does not totally conform to the rules of the  Official Card Game . This includes many cards having different  effects , or having their effects removed altogether, including, but not limited to,  Jirai Gumo ; this means that some Monster cards with effects in the OCG may not have any effects at all in this game, whether positive or negative. Rather than having flip effects or passive effects like many cards in the OCG, most cards seem to only be able to activate their effects on the first turn they are played. Many cards seen only in this game (the 'Creatable' cards) also have Type and/or Attribute that do not match their appearance at all. While this can also be seen in the official card game, this happens much more often in this game.
 During gameplay there is more than one way to win. A player may win by decreasing the opponent's life points to zero, forcing your opponent to run out of cards (have them unable to draw a card at the start of their turn), or by having all five pieces of  Exodia  in your hand.
 In order to duel, a player's Deck must contain 40 cards and be under their current Duelist Level. If the Deck is over/under 40 cards or over the Deck limit cost, the player will not be able to duel until the error is fixed. 
 Here are some basic rules for playing:
 
 You may only have up to five  monsters  on the field. 
 You may have up to five cards in your hand (Note: If you have five cards in hand at the start of your turn, you will not be able to draw a new card). 
 Each  Monster Card  may attack any opposition monster card on the field. 
 Once the field is empty, you may attack the opposing duelist's Life Points. 
 Each duelist starts with 8000 Life Points ( Life Points ). 
 In order to summon a 5-6 star Card, you must  Tribute  one monster that is already on the field. 
 In order to summon a 7-8 star Card, you must  Tribute  two monsters that are already on the field. 
 You may only summon one monster per turn. 
 You may also set one  Trap Card  on the field (Note: If the Trap is not used during the opponent's turn, it is removed at the start of your turn). 
 Battle types 
 In the game, players may notice a few different types of battle between monster cards. 
 The most basic way to defeat an opposing monster is to have a monster with higher attack 
 Example: Player A's card = 1000  ATK , Player B's card = 1200 ATK. Player A's card is destroyed and loses 200 Life Points ( Life Points )
 However, in Yu-Gi-Oh! Dark Duel Stories monsters can be destroyed because they have an inferior Alignment (which substitutes Attribute in this game). In this format, the difference between Attack or Defense points does not matter and the card with the inferior alignment is instantly destroyed. The exception to this rule is when the monster with the superior alignment also has higher attack points (when attacking) or defense points (when being attacked in defense position), in which case battle damage is calculated normally. However, when a defense position is attacked by a monster with an inferior alignment, the monster with the inferior alignment is destroyed.
 Alignment List :
 
         Alignment strengths and weaknesses.     
 Fire   beats   Forest 
 Forest   beats   Wind 
 Wind   beats   Earth 
 Earth   beats   Thunder 
 Thunder   beats   Aqua 
 Aqua   beats   Fire 
 also:
 Shadow   beats   Light 
 Light   beats   Fiend 
 Fiend   beats   Dreams 
 Dreams   beats   Shadow 
 No other type of card or alignment has an advantage over a card that has a  Divine  (misspelled in-game as Devine) type and alignment. In addition, cards that fall into one alignment list do not have an advantage over cards in the other.
 
 Passwords 
 In the game, players can go to the  Password Mode  option. There they can input an 8-digit password found at the bottom of each trading card (sold separately), saving the card into their chest. Players can add saved cards from their chest to their Deck, depending on how many points they have. The more points, the more stronger cards. You get points for winning battles, but you don't lose points for losing. 
 Téa Gardner  also gives you 1 card for every duel that you win. If you type in a special password,  Yugi's Grandpa  will also appear and give you another card. Téa and Grandpa will also give the player one card part for each win as well. (see "Card Creation" for part information)
 There are also hidden passwords that unlock the hidden bosses in STAGE 5 and the Credits. Since STAGE 5 can only have one duelist, once the player inputs a password for a STAGE 5 hidden boss ( Yami Yugi ,  Yami Bakura ,  Nitemare ,  Marik , and  Shadi ), the previous boss in that stage is deleted. But, when you re-enter the password for deleted box, the records are the same (meaning deleted duelist just doesn't appear while there's another duelist in stage 5, but when you re-enter them their old scores reappear. So the data of your previous battles with them are saved and are not erased).
 Note: Some cards will not be able to be added with the Password Option. Normally an incorrect password will simply not work, but entering certain card codes, like that of  Graceful Charity , will have the game give the alternate message "Can't Record Password! Try a different password." The cards corresponding to these codes were released in the Trading Card Game at the time this video game was made, but were not actually included in Dark Duel Stories itself.
 
 Card creation 
 It has a unique feature: Players can create cards using different card parts, one for the upper half, and one for the lower half. You cannot make a card unless you have at least one top and one bottom half of a card. The player can also preview the created card before using up his/her parts. The only real catch is that the attack and defense can only go as high as 2000.
 
 Fusion 
 Since  Polymerization  is not included in this game, Fusions occur differently; selecting one card and placing it on top of another compatible card could result in a fusion for an entirely different monster.
 These Fusions are Alignment-based and are reflected as such in the combination they create. For instance, fusing  Thunder Kid  with  Yamatano Dragon Scroll  would result in  Thunder Dragon . Similarly, combining it with any number of Aqua monsters would normally result in  Bolt Escargot . Also, combining  Time Wizard  with  Baby Dragon  would result in  Thousand Dragon .
