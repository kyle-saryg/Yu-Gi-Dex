 Human Sealing Technology  is a technology installed in some  Duel Disks  that allows the user to seal his/her target into cards. This technology is mainly used by Duel Warriors of  Duel Academy  and members of  The Resistance . During the  Invasion of Xyz Dimension , it is seen being used against the innocent civilians who have no ability to Duel.

 Process 
   Hitting the button   Emitting the light   Dissolving the loser 1/3 
 In order to use the device, the user must first defeat the target in a Duel, but if the target is unable to Duel, the user can seal them in a card right away. The user activates the function on his/her Duel Disk, which emits a purple light (or beam) that cover the loser. The victim's body is dissolved, and a blank card containing the soul of the victim is then released from the Duel Disk. The blank card then forms an image of the dissolved victim, in his/her last pose before being sealed, in a fashion similar to photos taken from a photo camera. It is possible to seal multiple victims simultaneously as well. It is also possible for the user to seal themselves into a card when they lose a Duel.
 This process seems to be irreversible by  LID 's technology (however they are able to disable this ability as  Shay 's Duel Disk can't use it anymore).  Celina  and Shay, who themselves used the technology, showed no attempt to release their LID's victims after they joined the  Lancers , suggesting that not even regular members of Duel Academy and the Resistance have the ability to undo it.
 Due to the technology originating from the  Fusion Dimension , it glows with a purple light, though  Kite Tenjo  somehow modified it to light blue.
 According to  Aster Phoenix , there is a way to undo the process but in order to do this, you would need the original carded person. The people sealed into cards are sent back to Duel Academy to be used as life energy for the  Arc Project . Once the project has been completed, the people will be released and permitted to live in the utopia of the merged dimensions.  Leo Akaba  stated that  ARC-V  was fueled by life energy, and the carded people were to be converted into that life energy to start the machine. Those who were sealed into cards were released when the  dimensions  began to merge after they were absorbed into ARC-V.
