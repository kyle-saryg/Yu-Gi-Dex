 Kaito Again!! 
 
 "Frankie!!" , known as  "Ken-chan!!"  in the Japanese version, is the seventeenth chapter of the  Yu-Gi-Oh! ZEXAL  manga . 
 This chapter was first printed in the 6/2012 issue of  V Jump , released on April 21, 2012.
 Yuma  continues his  Duel  against  Cologne . When Cologne Summons her " Number ", Yuma finds himself in a corner. In the middle of that desperate situation, Yuma learns about  Cologne's past .
 
 Summary 
 Yuma  Summons " No. 50: Black Ship of Corn ", but at that time, Cologne says that she will show the power of "Ken-chan". She activates " Quick Xyz ",  overlaying  her monsters to  Xyz Summon  " No. 22: Zombiestein ". Surprised with its 4500  ATK , Yuma  activates  the  effect  of "Black Ship of Corn" in order to  destroy  it, but the effect of "Zombiestein"  negates  the effect of "Black Ship of Corn", and makes itself attack "Black Ship of Corn" during Yuma's turn. Besides this fearful combination of ATK power and effect negating of "Zombiestein", Cologne also plays Spell Cards to break into Yuma's defenses.  Astral  recognizes Cologne as a strong  Duelist , and gets fired up. Yuma and Astral then try to first the Overlay Units to 0, but even that fails, with Cologne using a Trap Card, " Xyz Bento ", to recover them. Seeing Cologne's resolve for winning, while shocked at her strength, Yuma comments to her about her desire of winning to follow  Mr. Heartland 's request, and she reveals about her past.
 Cologne was once a doll, who was bought by a rich girl. However, that rich girl soon was given a new doll, making her forget about Cologne, and abandoning her. She was then sent to the disposal plant of  Heartland . There,  Dr. Faker  picked her up and made her a "human". Cologne then explains that if she loses, her soul will leave her, making her return to what she was. She then yells crying that she doesn't want to be a miserable doll anymore. This feeling strike Yuma and the others, making Yuma hesitate about the Duel. At that time  Cathy  notes she was the girl who abandoned Cologne. She gets awkward and confused about what to do, but when she decides telling the truth,  Kotori  says that she was the one who abandoned her, and apologizes. She did this so that Cologne soothed her anger, and that Yuma could concentrate in the Duel, but Cologne knows she is lying, and gets even angrier, throwing oil in the fire surrounding them so that it gets higher, almost hitting them.
 Yuma and Astral continue the Duel. Against the power of "Zombiestein", they play defensively, and as a last attempt, Astral comes up with the idea of using an effect which activates from the  Graveyard  - by that way, "Zombiestein" cannot negate it. However, smashing any strategies Yuma and Astral may use, Cologne overcomes the play and puts Yuma in a critical situation.
 
 Featured Duel: Yuma Tsukumo vs. Cologne 
 Duel continues from  the previous Rank . 
 Turn 4: Yuma 
 Cologne   activates  " Quick Xyz " and  overlays  " Doll Monster Bear-Bear Re-Customized " and " Doll Monster Miss Mädchen  Re-Customized " to  Xyz Summon  " No. 22: Zombiestein " (4500/1000) in  Attack Position . Yuma activates the  effect  of " No. 50: Black Ship of Corn ",  detaching  an  Overlay Unit  to  destroy  "Zombiestein", but Cologne  chains  with the effect of "Zombiestein", detaching an Overlay Unit and  discarding  a card to  negate  the effect of "Black Ship of Corn". Also, due to its effect, "Zombiestein" is forced to battle, so it  attacks  "Black Ship of Corn", destroying it (Yuma 4000 → 1600). Yuma activates the effect of " Knight Hunger Monger ", who was used as an Overlay Unit for "Black Ship of Corn",  Special Summoning  a  Level  3 or lower monster from his  hand  in  face-down   Defense Position  as the  Xyz Monster  which used it as a Material was destroyed. He switches " Zubaba Knight " to Defense Position.
 Turn 5: Cologne 
Cologne attacks Yuma's face-down monster with "Zombiestein". It was " Pero Pero Cerberus " (0/1800), who is destroyed. She also activates the  Spell Card  " Curse of the Dolls ", destroying Yuma's "Zubaba Knight" as she has 5 or more " Doll " monsters in her  Graveyard . She  Sets  1 card.
 Turn 6: Yuma 
Yuma Sets a monster and a card.
 Turn 7: Cologne 
Cologne Normal Summons " Zombie Dog " (1000/1000). She attacks Yuma's face-down monster with "Zombiestein". It was " Poppopo Knight " (800/2000), who is destroyed. Yuma activates his face-down " Reverse Wall ", which, as a monster with 2000 or more  DEF  he  controls  was destroyed, destroys all monsters the opponent  controls . However, Cologne chains the effect of "Zombiestein", detaching an Overlay Unit and discarding a card to negate the effect of "Reverse Wall". She activates her face-down " Xyz Bento ", which  attaches  "Poppopo Knight" to "Zombiestein" as an Overlay Unit. Cologne attacks  directly  with "Zombie Dog", who gains 500  ATK  due to its own effect (Yuma 1600 → 100). Yuma activates the effect of "Pero Pero Cerberus" from his Graveyard,  banishing  it to destroy "Zombie Dog", as it inflicted damage to Yuma's  Life Points .
 Turn 8: Yuma 
Yuma Sets 1 monster.
 Turn 9: Cologne 
Cologne attacks Yuma's face-down monster with "Zombiestein". It was " Chamelele Leon " (1000/1400), who is destroyed. Yuma activates its effect, Special Summoning " Gagaga Girl " (1000/800) from his  Deck  in face-up  Attack Position . Cologne chains the  Quick-Play Spell Card  " Pursuit of the Fiend ", detaching all Overlay Units from "Zombiestein" and allowing it to attack twice during this turn. "Zombiestein" attacks "Gagaga Girl".
 Duel continues in  the next Rank .
