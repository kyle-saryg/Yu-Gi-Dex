 Previously Official Rulings 
   These TCG rulings were issued by  Upper Deck Entertainment  and have since been deemed unofficial by Konami. [2]  They were previously considered official and can still be correct, as long as they follow the official gameplay rules, or unless Konami has issued a ruling that says otherwise. References:  [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [1] 
 
 " Amazoness Swordswoman "  [ sic ]  only applies her effect to  Battle Damage  to her controller, so if attacked by a stronger monster, the " Amazoness Swordswoman "  [ sic ]  herself is still destroyed as normal. [1] 
 Damage inflicted to the opponent when " Amazoness Swordswoman "'s  [ sic ]  effect is activated is Battle Damage, so the opponent cannot use " Barrel Behind the Door ". [1] 
 When " Dark Ruler Ha Des " attacks " Amazoness Swordswoman "  [ sic ] , the effect of " Amazoness Swordswoman "  [ sic ]  is still resolved. [1] 
 When a monster affected by " Diffusion Wave-Motion " attacks " Amazoness Swordswoman "  [ sic ] , the " Amazoness Swordswoman "'s  [ sic ]  effect is applied and the opponent (who used " Diffusion Wave-Motion ") takes the damage dealt to Life Points. Likewise, the controller of " Spear Dragon " takes damages when " Spear Dragon " battles " Amazoness Swordswoman "  [ sic ]  (or the controller of a monster equipped with " Fairy Meteor Crush ", or who used " Meteorain "). [1] 
 When the controller of " Amazoness Swordswoman "  [ sic ]  uses " Kuriboh ", the controller takes zero Battle Damage so no damage is dealt to the opponent. [1] 
 When " Susa Soldier " battles " Amazoness Swordswoman "  [ sic ] , the controller of " Susa Soldier " takes full damage; the damage is NOT halved. [1] 
 Mentions in Other Rulings 
 Begone, Knave! : The effect of " Begone, Knave! " is applied to the monster that inflicts Battle Damage to the player, so if "Amazoness Swords Woman" battles a stronger monster, "Amazoness Swords Woman" would normally be returned to the owner's hand, but because she is destroyed and sent to the Graveyard, she will not be returned. 
 Confusion Chaff : If your “Amazoness Swords Woman” declares the second direct attack during a Battle Phase, and “ Confusion Chaff ” is activated, your opponent will take any battle damage from that battle. 
 Cross Counter : If your opponent's "Amazoness Swords Woman" attacks your Defense Position " Mystical Elf ", and you activate " Cross Counter ", you (the controller of "Cross Counter" and "Mystical Elf") take 1000 points of damage due to the effect of "Amazoness Swords Woman", and then "Cross Counter" destroys "Amazoness Swords Woman". 
 Diffusion Wave-Motion : When a Level 7 Spellcaster-Type monster selected with " Diffusion Wave-Motion " attacks " Amazoness Fighter " or " Amazoness Swordswoman "  [ sic ] , their effects are still applied normally at damage calculation. 
 Divine Wrath : You cannot chain " Divine Wrath " to  Continuous Effects  such as: ... " Amazoness Swords Woman " .... 
 Lone Wolf : If you have " Monk Fighter " targeted by " Lone Wolf ", the following are examples of monster effects that will NOT be negated because they are not applied to a monster..." Amazoness Swords Woman " (Battle Damage is still redirected)... 
 Meteorain : When you attack with a monster that has " Meteorain "'s bonus, and you attack a Defense Position " Amazoness Swordswoman "  [ sic ] , then you will take the Battle Damage to your Life Points. 
 Stone Statue of the Aztecs : When " Amazoness Swordswoman "  [ sic ]  (1500 ATK) attacks " Stone Statue of the Aztecs " (2000 DEF), the controller of Stone Statue of the Aztecs takes 1000 Battle Damage. 
 Wicked-Breaking Flamberge - Baou : If a monster equipped with " Wicked-Breaking Flamberge - Baou " attacks and destroys " Amazoness Fighter " or " Amazoness Swordswoman "  [ sic ] , their effects are not negated because they happen during damage calculation, before they are determined to have been destroyed.
