 History 
 The lab was commissioned by unknown peoples (the dub implies it was owned by  KaibaCorp ). It was used as a location to experiment on animals. Monkeys were used, as they were known to be able to hear the voices of  Duel Monster Spirits  (the dub instead states that the subjects were punished for making Dueling mistakes). Subjects were fitted with cybernetic gear to aide in Dueling, with a helmet having been used to give them access to Dueling terminology. [1] 
 
 Events 
 One test subject,  Wheeler , eventually escaped the lab. He was pursued into the  forest  by the  doctor  and  Tatewaki . Wheeler would kidnap  Jasmine , a student at Duel Academy and was eventually cornered by the group from the lab and some of Jasmine's friends. Wheeler Dueled and lost to  Jaden Yuki  and was let free along with other monkeys after  Professor Banner  threatened to call the authorities about the lab's indiscretions. [1] 
 At some point after this, the lab was abandoned.
 
 Non-canon appearances 
 The lab appears in the  GX Tag Force  series. It features the  Card Conversion Machine  and  Password Machine , as well as a card rental counter for use with the latter device. It is inhabited by the head researcher from the anime, called "Doctor" in-game and the security guards, called "Researchers" in-game.
 The location serves the same purpose in  Tag Force 2  and also appears in storyline events that involve  Thelonious Viper .
