 After beating the Hologram Man,  Yuga  was able to install the Rush Duel program. However,  Luke  wants to keep this a secret from the Goha Corporation, while Yuga wants everyone to enjoy fun Duels. The two decide to settle this dispute with a Rush Duel.

 Turn 2: Luke Luke Normal Summons " Dragolite " (Level 4/1500/0) and two copies of " Twin-Edge Dragon " (Level 3/1000/0). Luke activates the effects of both "Twin-Edge Dragons", sending " Dragon's Priestess " and " Dragon Bat " from his hand to the  GY  to allow both of them to attack twice each during this turn's Battle Phase. 
 "Dragolite" attacks "Dark Sorcerer", and both monsters are destroyed in a  Double KO . The first "Twin-Edge Dragon" attacks  directly  twice (Yuga: 4000 → 3000 → 2000  LP ). The second "Twin-Edge Dragon" attacks directly, but Yuga activates his face-down  Normal Trap Card  " Curtain of Sparks ", reducing the ATK of the attacking monster by 500 since Luke declared an attack while Yuga has a  Spellcaster  monster in his GY ("Twin-Edge Dragon": 1000 → 500 ATK). The attack continues (Yuga: 2000 → 1500 LP). The second "Twin-Edge Dragon" attacks directly again (Yuga: 1500 → 1000 LP).
 Turn 3: Yuga As Yuga has one card in his hand, he draws 4 cards. Yuga Normal Summons " Child of Wind, Cyc " (Level 2/400/600), " Mystic Dealer " (Level 3/1000/0) and " Stray Familiar " (Level 1/0/1400). Yuga activates the effect of "Mystic Dealer", letting him send a Spellcaster monster from his hand to the GY to draw a card. He sends " Hydro Magician ". He then tributes "Mystic Dealer" to  Tribute Summon  " Windcaster Torna " (Level 6/1600/1000). Yuga activates the effect of "Cyc", letting him add a Level 4 or lower Spellcaster from his GY to his hand since he controls another face-up  WIND  Spellcaster monster. He adds "Dark Sorcerer". He then tributes "Cyc" and "Stray Familiar" to Tribute Summon " Sevens Road Magician " (Level 7/2100/1500).
 Yuga activates the effect of "Torna", sending a card from his hand to the GY to change the battle position of 1 monster Luke controls. He targets one "Twin-Edge Dragon", switching it to Defense Position. He then activates his set  Normal Spell Card  " Piercing! ", letting 1 face-up monster he controls inflict  piercing  damage this turn. He targets "Sevens Road Magician". Yuga activates the effect of "Sevens Road Magician", sending the top card of his Deck (" Recovery Force ") to the GY to increase the ATK of "Sevens Road Magician" by 300 for each different Attribute in his GY until the End Phase ("Sevens Road Magician": 2100 → 3300 ATK).
 "Torna" attacks and destroys the Attack Position "Twin-Edge Dragon" (Luke: 4000 → 3400 LP). "Sevens Road Magician" attacks and destroys the Defense Position "Twin-Edge Dragon", inflicting piercing damage to Luke (Luke: 3400 → 100 LP). 
 Turn 4: Luke As Luke has no cards in his hand, he draws 5 cards. Luke Normal Summons "Dragon Bat" (Level 3/1000/400) and " Palm-Sized Drago " (Level 1/0/1400), then tributes them to Tribute Summon " Rush Dragon Dragears " (Level 7/2500/1500). Luke activates the effect of "Dragears", sending the top card of his Deck (" Fire Guardian ") to the GY to allow "Dragears" to attack again if it destroys a monster by battle this turn. Since he controls a face-up  Dragon  monster, Luke activates " Fire Dragon's Heatflash ", letting him destroy 1 Spell/Trap Yuga controls. He destroys Yuga's set Normal Trap Card " Dark Liberation ".
 "Dragears" attacks and destroys "Torna" (Yuga: 1000 → 100 LP). Since it destroyed a monster by battle, the effect of "Dragears" lets it attack again. "Dragears" attacks and destroys "Sevens Road Magician" (Yuga: 100 → 0 LP).
