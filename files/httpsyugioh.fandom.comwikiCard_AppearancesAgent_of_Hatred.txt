 In  episode 22 ,  Commander Koda  uses this card during his Ground Duel against  Akiza Izinski . He Special Summons this card via " Crime and Punishment ". " Black Garden " then halves the ATK of this card and Special Summons a Rose Token to Akiza's side of the field. At the end of the Battle Phase, Koda activates this card's effect to increase his Life Points by the Battle Damage he took from the direct attack made by " Violet Witch ". On Akiza's next turn, she uses " Phoenixian Cluster Amaryllis " to attack the Attack Position Rose Token on Koda's side of the field. The Rose Token was not destroyed, but Koda still takes Battle Damage. After damage calculation, "Phoenixian Cluster Amaryllis" is destroyed by its first effect. The second effect of "Amaryllis" then activates, inflicting 800 damage to Koda. At the end of the Battle Phase, Koda activates this card's effect to increase his Life Points equal to the Battle Damage he took from the battle between his Rose Token and Akiza's "Phoenixian Cluster Amaryllis". After "Black Garden" was banished by the effect of " Mad Profiler ", all monsters on the field regained their original ATK. This card remained on the field until the Duel was over.
