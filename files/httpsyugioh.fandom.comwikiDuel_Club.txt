 Biography 
 Hanoi 
 Yusaku  was following  Skye Zaizen  at school when he witnessed her entering the Duel Club.  Naoki  appeared at that moment and, noticing that Yusaku was wearing his  Duel Disk , inferred that he wanted to join the club, but insisted that it was no place for someone with no interest in  LINK VRAINS . Club president  Hosoda  opened the door from inside to reprimand Naoki for making so much noise, but allowed Yusaku to join, stating that new applicants are always welcome. Yusaku was reluctant, but  Ai  accepted for him. [1] 
 After all the club members introduced themselves,  Sato  showed off his new Duel Disk, with Yusaku feigning interest about its new AI program that assists in Dueling. Skye commented that Yusaku knew a lot, and Yusaku said it was only because Naoki bragged about it, but he hadn't realized that everyone in the group had the new Duel Disk. Naoki took exception to this, and replied that Skye's brother  Akira  was a big shot at  SOL Technology  and gave the Duel Club members the new model first, prompting a stern look from Skye. [1] 
 When Ai tried to start a conversation with Skye's Duel Disk, Skye noticed that Yusaku's Duel Disk was a card-loading model, the same as Playmaker's. Naoki speculated that Yusaku was copying Playmaker (not knowing that they were one and the same), but lamented that Playmaker was behind the times using such an old model. Skye then asked to see Yusaku's Deck, and was scolded by Hosoda who thought the question to be rude, but Yusaku said it was fine and handed Skye his Deck (which was actually a dummy Deck instead of his real one). After Skye looked at the cards, she tried to give the Deck back, but Naoki snatched it up and started laughing about how lame the Deck was, to which Hosoda rebuked him for insulting it. Naoki then gave it back to Yusaku and apologized, but Yusaku told him he was right. [1] 
 Afterward, while Hosoda gave a lesson on the differences between  Speed Duels  and  Master Duels , Yusaku kept staring at Skye. Ai told him it was a good idea to replace his Deck with a dummy one, and Yusaku told him to be quiet. The next day, while Yusaku was in the classroom, Ai told him that a  Knight of Hanoi  had appeared. Yusaku immediately left and went to the balcony behind the Duel Club to enter LINK VRAINS. [1] 
 
 The Deleted 
 Hosoda disbanded the Duel Club after admitting that none of their members were ready to face the Knights of Hanoi. This drew a protest from Naoki. As the members left, Naoki stayed in the room to watch LINK VRAINS.  [2] 
 On a different day, Naoki hid in the Duel Club room after being bluntly told by Yusaku that he was not good enough to fight the Knights of Hanoi. There, he received new card data and logged into LINK VRAINS for the first time.  [3] 
 
 Lost Memories 
 The Duel Club reformed, with Naoki Shima and Skye Zaizen as regular visitors.  [4]
