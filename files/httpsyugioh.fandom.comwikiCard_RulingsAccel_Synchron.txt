 The " Once per turn : You can  send  1 " Synchron " monster from your  Deck  to the  Graveyard , then  activate  1 of these  effects " effect is an  Ignition Effect . (It does not target. Sending 1 " Synchron " monster from your  Deck  to the  Graveyard  is a cost to activate this effect.) [1] 
 You choose whether to increase or reduce this card's Level when this effect is activated. [1] 
 The " During your opponent's  Main Phase , you can: Immediately after this effect  resolves ,  Synchro Summon  1  Synchro Monster , using  Materials  including this card you  control  (this is a  Quick Effect ). " effect is a  Quick Effect . (It does not target.) [1] 
 If you send " Quickdraw Synchron " to the Graveyard, this card's Level is reduced by 5. In this case, this card's Level becomes 1. Also, after this effect is applied, if " Star Changer " increases this card's Level by 1, its Level is recalculated. From its original Level 5, its Level is reduced by 5 using its own effect, then its Level is increased by 1 using the effect of " Star Changer ". Therefore, this card's Level becomes 1 (5 - 5 + 1).
