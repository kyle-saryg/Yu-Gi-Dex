 Featured Duel: Yuma Tsukumo and Ray Shadows vs. Girag 
 This  Duel  is conducted as a  Battle Royal .
 Turn 1: Girag 
 Girag  draws " Fire Hand " and subsequently  Normal Summons  it ( 4/1600/1000) in Attack Position. He then  Sets  a card.
 Turn 2: Ray 
 Ray  draws " Shining Destroyer " and subsequently Normal Summons it ( 3/0/1800) in Attack Position. His  hand  is shown to contain " Shining Reborn ", which he then Sets.
 
       " Number 39: Utopia " is Summoned.     
 Turn 3: Yuma 
Yuma draws. As he  controls  no  monsters ,  Yuma   Special Summons  " Dododo Buster " in Attack Position via its own  effect  by reducing its  Level  by 2 ( 4 → 2/1900/800). He then Normal Summons " Ganbara Knight " ( 4/0/1800) in Attack Position. Yuma then  overlays  "Dododo Buster" and "Ganbara Knight" in order to  Xyz Summon  " Number 39: Utopia " ( 4/2500/2000, ORU: 2) in  Attack Position . Yuma Sets a card.
 
           " Fire Hand " and " Ice Hand ".     
         Girag activates " Hand Block ".     
 Turn 4: Girag 
Girag draws " Ice Hand " and subsequently Normal Summons it ( 4/1600/1600) in Attack Position. Girag overlays "Fire Hand" and "Ice Hand" in order to Xyz Summon " Number 106: Giant Hand " ( 4/2000/2000, ORU: 2) in Attack Position. 
 "Giant Hand"  attacks  "Shining Destroyer", but Yuma  activates  the effect of "Utopia",  detaching  an  Overlay Unit  ("Utopia": 2 → 1 ORU) to  negate  the attack. As the effect of an opponent's  Effect Monster  was activated, Girag activates the second effect of "Giant Hand" to detach an Overlay Unit ("Giant Hand": 2 → 1 ORU) and negate the effect of "Utopia" as long as "Giant Hand" is  face-up . "Giant Hand" then destroys" "Shining Destroyer" (Ray: 4000 → 2000 LP). The effect of "Shining Destroyer" then activates, inflicting 600  damage  to all players, but Girag activates his  face-down  " Hand Block " to reduce the effect damage he takes to 0 (as he controls a " Hand " monster) (Yuma: 4000 → 3400 LP, Ray: 2000 → 1400 LP).
 Duel continues in  the next episode. 
 
 Errors 
 After " Ice Hand " is shown the second time before the  monster  hologram of it appears, it has 1400  ATK  on its card instead of 1600.
