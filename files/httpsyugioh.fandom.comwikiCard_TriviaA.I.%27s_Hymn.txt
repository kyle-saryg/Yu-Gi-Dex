 This card's name in Japanese may be a pun on "Ai no Sanka" (愛の賛歌), the Japanese adaption of the popular French song by Edith Piaf,  Hymne a l'amour  ( Hymn of Love ).
 In 1951, the adaption of the song became quite popular in Japan by singer  Fubuki Koshiji , becoming one of her signature songs and amassing around 2,000,000 copies sold of various singles featuring this song.
