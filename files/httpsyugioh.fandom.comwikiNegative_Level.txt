Negative Levels  are a concept appearing only in the  Yu-Gi-Oh! 5D's  anime and the  Tag Force  series of video games. They appear exclusively on  Dark Synchro Monsters .
 They are represented by the symbol  , which is the color inverse of the usual positive  Level  symbol. On a card, the Negative Level Stars align to the left, whereas positive Level Stars align to the right.
 The only way for a non-Dark Synchro  monster  to obtain a Negative Level is through the card " Dark Wave ".
 When Dark Synchro Monsters were released in the  OCG / TCG , they were all changed to regular  Synchro Monsters  with their levels changed to the usual positive.
 
 Example 
 A negative Level A positive Level 
 Trivia 
 Contrary to what might be expected, the  Tag Force  video games seem to treat negative Levels identically to positive Levels in some ways. For example, it is possible to use a Level 5 monster(s) and a Level -5 monster(s) as  Xyz Materials  to  Xyz Summon  a  Rank  5  Xyz Monster . [1]
