 Biography 
 Arc League Championship 
 Ashley's fellow student  Chalac  was defeated by  Shay Obsidian  during the second round of the  Arc League Championship , causing Ashley and his fellow students  Bram  and  Carl  to develop a grudge against Shay. They all made it to the Top 16 of the Championship, and at the gathering for the  Battle Royal  the next day, they looked for Shay in the stadium, but he wasn't present. [3]  Ashley, Bram, and Carl later found Shay in the Ancient Ruins area of " Quartet of Quandry ", but despite all three of them taking on Shay, he defeated them with " Raidraptor - Rise Falcon ". [1]  They later began their own Duel, attacking one another with their " Slash the Assault Knight ", and using their effects to prevent themselves from taking damage, but still causing harm to Shay and  Yuya Sakaki  in the immediate area, claiming that they weren't breaking the rules. The  Obelisk Force  arrived with Shay's first opponent,  Sora Perse , and they Dueled and defeated the three Knights,  sealing  Carl into  a card . [4]  Despite their protests, Ashley and Bram were soon sealed  into   cards  as well. [5]
