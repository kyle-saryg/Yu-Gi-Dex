 Summary 
 Back aboard his  Duel Coaster ,  Yuma  hits a Trap Point - " Cemetary Bomb ". As he emerges from the smoke, he bemoans his luck.  Tori  yells at him, saying he should pay attention.  Astral  shouts that there's another trap ahead. Yuma barely changes lanes in time, narrowly avoiding the trap. Tori angrily asks him what's wrong with him. Yuma is saddened as he remembers the  Duels  he witnessed and the histories of  Dextra ,  Kite ,  Quattro ,  Quinton  and  Shark . Tori tells him to watch out again as they spiral towards the Desert  Duel Field . When they emerge, the Duel Coaster tracks continue throughout the battlefield. Yuma asks where they are and Astral responds that it must be the field where they will fight. 
 
       Yuma  arrives at the " Desert Field "  Duel Field .     
 Yuma brings his Duel Coaster to a halt when he sees  Nistro , who says he has been waiting for him. Nistro suggests they get started immediately. At the  Duel Coaster Stadium ,  Mr. Heartland  yells "Heart Burning!" and wonders who will advance to the semifinals - Yuma or Nistro? He announces that the field is the " Desert Field ". Yuma and Nistro re-enter their coasters and begin, with Nistro having 4000  Life Points , but Yuma having still be reduced to 100 after the Duel Coaster.
 
         Nistro  and  Dextra  before being found by  Mr. Heartland  (this scene is cut from the dub).     
 Nistro stands up in his Duel Coaster and  Normal Summons  " Heroic Challenger - Double Lance ". Rocks begin to fall from the sky and Nistro's Life Points fall to 3800. Heartland explains that the  Field Spell  damaged him and that whenever a  monster  is Summoned in  Attack Position  or  attacks , its  controller  will take 200  damage . Tori says that means their Life Points will decrease whenever they attack and Yuma says that's not good - he has only 100 left to begin with. Heartland mutters that he thought Nistro would like this field and that he should consider it a present (this part is removed from the dub). Nistro seems to think this does seem like something Heartland would do. He thinks back to his childhood. He is fleeing something with Dextra. As Mr. Heartland arrives via helicopter, he says that Heartland took them in - but they were forced to learn how to Duel and were to follow his every order (this part is cut from the dub). 
 Nistro reveals that Dueling Yuma previously reawakened his Dueling spirit. He yells that this is the Duel he always wanted. He uses the  effect  of "Double Lance", letting it be treated as two  Overlay Units  for the  Xyz Summon  of a " Heroic Champion " monster. He overlays his now two  Level  4 monsters to Xyz Summon " Heroic Champion - Gandiva " in Attack Position. This time, sparks fly up from the coaster's track, dropping his Life Points to 3600. Astral says he seems not to care about the Field Spell's effect. Nistro  Sets  two cards, ends his  turn  and urges Yuma to come at him.
 
       Nistro  activates  " Heroic Gift ", evening out the  Duel .     
 Yuma thinks that he needs to consider his current Life Points. With them, he won't be able to attack. Astral asks him what he's waiting for - Nistro is full of confidence, if they don't give it their all, they'll stand no chance. Yuma tells him he knows that and  draws . Nistro  activates  his  face-down  " Heroic Gift ", explaining that when his opponent's Life Points are lower than 2000, they can become 4000 and he can draw two cards. Yuma and Astral both appear confused as to why he did that and Yuma angrily asks what he thinks he's doing. Nistro tells him he just wanted to draw some extra cards, but adds that defeating weakened opponents is not a hobby of his. Yuma still seems angry, while Astral thinks that Nistro is really risking everything by healing Yuma. Yuma Sets a monster, but Astral tells them he won't win by going on the defensive against Nistro. Yuma responds that has his own plans, Sets a card and ends his turn.
 Nistro chides him for being too wary and Normal Summons " Heroic Challenger - Night Watchman ", causing his Life Points to fall to 3400 as more rocks fall. Yuma is excited that Nistro took more damage and Nistro says the damage doesn't matter. He attacks the Set monster with "Night Watchman" and his Life Points fall to 3200. He explains that "Night Watchman" can  destroy  a face-down monster it attacks without  damage calculation . Yuma's face-down " Mogmole " is destroyed. Nistro says he has no defenses left and  declares  a  direct attack  with "Gandiva". Yuma says he knew Nistro would do that and reveals that the "Mogmole" can revive itself in  face-up   Defense Position  after it is destroyed, but only once. He continues that Nistro's attacks cost him 400 Life Points and were wasted. Nistro is perplexed, saying that this isn't the kind of the Duel he expected. He activates the effect of "Gandiva",  detaching  an Overlay Unit to destroy a Special Summoned Level 4 or lower monster. "Gandiva" fires its bow; the arrow splits in numerous luminescent arrows in the air, which hit "Mogmole" and destroy it. 
 
         Rocks fall, damaging Yuma via the effect of "Desert Field".     
 Nistro says that if Yuma gives him a poor Duel like this, he'll stand no chance. He orders "Gandiva" to attack directly, but Yuma activates his face-down " Battle Break ", which would destroy an attacking monster and end the  Battle Phase . Nistro asks if Yuma really thought something like that would stop him and activates his face-down " Battler's Pride ",  negating  a card effect that would end an attack or Battle Phase. The attack of "Gandiva" continues, reducing Yuma to 1900 Life Points. Nistro Sets a card and ends his turn as his Life Points fall to 3000 via "Desert Field". Nistro asks if Yuma understands yet - he won't be defeated if Yuma Duels as he has been. Yuma says he can't lose this Duel, but Astral tells him he can't win it. Yuma is confused, but Astral says Yuma is so focused on winning that he's become afraid of Dueling. He adds that due to seeing Kite and Shark's Duels, Yuma has developed an unconscious fear of Dueling. Yuma angrily asks if Astral thinks he's scared and draws. Astral asks if he's wrong.
 
         " Heroic Challenger - Night Watchman " defends " Heroic Champion - Gandiva " with " Heroic Advance ".     
 Yuma Normal Summons " Gagaga Magician ", so his Life Points fall to 1700 as a large rock hits him the head. He  equips  "Gagaga Magician" with " One-Shot Wand ", explaining that it can increase a  Spellcaster - Type  monster's  ATK  by 800. He says that with this, "Gagaga Magician" is stronger. He attacks "Gandiva" with "Gagaga Magician", who fires a huge purple beam from its new wand, causing his Life Points to fall to 1500. Nistro asks if Yuma really thinks that would work and activates his face-down " Heroic Advance ". He explains that when a "Heroic Champion" is  targeted  for an attack, this card can redirect the attack to a Level 4 or lower " Heroic Challenger " monster and double its ATK. The ATK of "Night Watchman" is doubled to 2400 as its sword grows. He adds that neither monster will be destroyed. "Night Watchman" absorbs the beam with its sword and fires it back at "Gagaga Magician" and Yuma's Life Points fall to 1400.
 Yuma activates the effect of "One-Shot Wand", explaining that he can destroy it at the end of a Battle Phase to draw a card. The card is " Grandram ", which he immediately  Special Summons  in Attack Position, explaining that its effect can do so when his opponent controls an Xyz Monster. His Life Points fall to 1200 as "Grandram" bursts from one of the canyon walls. He overlays his two Level 4 monsters to Xyz Summon " Gagaga Cowboy " in Defense Position (in the dub, its guns are repainted green to correspond with its TCG artwork). Nistro is angry it was Summoned in Defense Position, but Astral says Yuma will take no damage that way. Yuma activates the effect of "Gagaga Cowboy". As it is in Defense Position, he can detach an Overlay Unit to inflict 800 damage. "Gagaga Cowboy" shoots Nistro several times, dropping him to 2200. Yuma Sets two cards and ends his turn.
 
         Nistro activates " Xyz Crown ".     
 Nistro rises and says that Yuma is using cheap tricks. He yells he didn't want to have a boring Duel like this. He activates " Xyz Crown ", equipping it to "Gandiva". He explains that it can be equipped to an Xyz Monster and change its Rank to Level of an equivalent number. Therefore, "Gandiva" becomes a Level 4 monster and can also be treated as two Overlay Units for an Xyz Summon. Yuma is shocked to see an Xyz Monster being used as a material and Nistro overlays his now-three Level 4 monsters to Xyz Summon " Heroic Champion - Kusanagi " in Attack Position. Nistro's Life Points fall to 2000 and he tells Yuma that if he wants to defeat him, he must come at him with his true Dueling. Yuma realizes that Nistro has always used his own true Dueling. He looks back, considering his past moves to not have been in line with his true Dueling (this part is cut from the dub). He slows his Duel Coaster and changes lanes, arriving back at the starting point. 
 Tori asks him what's wrong and Yuma asks her to leave, saying he'll continue alone from here. He says he must bet everything on this Duel. Nistro slowly rolls in the adjacent lane, still standing in his coaster. Tori smiles and gets off the coaster, but tells Yuma to be sure to pick her back up after winning. As Yuma and Nistro leave, Tori yells "good luck!" Astral muses that Kite and Shark are strong - they both have powers that can be feared; he understands how Yuma could be scared of them. He adds that Yuma has gotten over those sorts of fears before though. Yuma smiles and says that in the end, he must go on with his own Dueling. Yuma stands up and yells that he'll show Nistro his true Dueling now. Nistro is pleased he's taking this seriously now. 
 
         Sparks fly up from the tracks, damaging Nistro via the effect of "Desert Field".     
 Their monsters reappear and Nistro activates " Fighter's Charm ", changing "Gagaga Cowboy" to Attack Position, but its ATK becomes equal to its  DEF  until the End Phase. "Kusanagi" attacks "Gagaga Cowboy" as sparks fly up and Nistro's Life Points become 1800. Yuma activates his face-down " Overlay Buster ", increasing the ATK of "Gagaga Cowboy" to 2900. Nistro activates the effect of "Kusanagi", negating the activation of a Trap Card by detaching an Overlay Unit and increasing the ATK of "Kusanagi" by 500. "Kusanagi" continues its attack, but Yuma activates his face-down " Fighting Fund ", preventing the destruction of "Gagaga Cowboy"  by battle . Nistro reminds him he'll still take the damage though. Yuma's Life Points become 600 and he is nearly flung from his coaster. Nistro Sets two cards and asks Yuma if he'll give up now with only 600 Life Points left. Yuma says there's no way t he'll do that and that the true battle will start now. Nistro chuckles and says that is what he wanted.
 
         " Heroic Champion - Kusanagi " and " Gagaga Cowboy " draw.     
 The tracks of the Duel Coaster abruptly end and they are both flung from their coasters onto the ground below. The tracks and canyon vanish are replaced by a red sunset. Astral says its a new Field Spell - " Sunset Showdown ". He explains that each player may only attack with one monster and when a monster is destroyed, its controller will take 300 damage. They continue their Duel, with Yuma's turn. He attacks "Kusanagi" with "Gagaga Cowboy", with Nistro reminding him that "Kusanagi" has higher ATK. Yuma reveals that when "Gagaga Cowboy" is in Attack Position, it can detach an Overlay Unit to increase its own ATK by 1000 and decrease another monster's ATK by 500. "Gagaga Cowboy" shoots a hail of energy shots at "Kusanagi" with two pistols. Nistro calls it a nice play and Yuma orders "Gagaga Cowboy" to attack. Nistro activates his face-down " Heroic Change ", followed by the effect of "Kusanagi", negating his own trap and increasing its ATK by 500, back to 2500. Both of them are thrown onto their backs and Nistro says it was a draw. They both lose 300 Life Points via the new Field Spell's effect, leaving Nistro with 1500 and Yuma with 300. 
 Nistro tells Yuma this will be the last battle and activates his face-down " Xyz Xtreme !! ". He explains that when two Xyz Monsters destroy one another by battle, he can  pay  1000 Life Points to let both players Special Summon Xyz Monsters of the same Rank from their Extra Decks. Nistro chooses " Heroic Champion - Excalibur ", adding that both Xyz Monsters Summoned by this effect will destroyed at the end of the Battle Phase (though Nistro does not mention it, the card also  attachs  the previously destroyed Xyz Monsters to the new ones as Overlay Units). 
 
         Yuma activates " Double or Nothing! ".     
 Nistro tells Yuma its his turn to Summon one and urges him to choose " Number 39: Utopia ". He claims the fight won't be fun if they don't use their  ace monsters . Astral muses that he wants to battle a " Number " and Yuma says he'll accept the challenge. "Utopia" appears and Nistro tells Yuma to come at him. Yuma attacks "Excalibur" with "Utopia". Nistro activates the effect of "Excalibur", detaching the Overlay Units to double its ATK to 4000. Yuma detaches an Overlay Unit to activate the " Moon Barrier " effect of "Utopia", negating his own attack. Nistro reminds him that at the end of the Battle Phase both monsters will be destroyed and Yuma will lose via the effect of the Field Spell. Yuma says he still has one more card and activates " Double or Nothing! " from his hand. As an attack was negated, that monster's ATK can be doubled. The ATK of "Utopia" becomes 5000. He orders "Utopia" to attack with " Hope Sword Double Slash ". Nistro's Life Points fall to 0. 
 
         Nistro and Yuma shake hands.     
 Heartland yells that its been decided - the last semifinalist will be Yuma. Nistro apologizes to Dextra for losing and compliments Yuma for his great guts (in the dub, Nistro asks for the license plate for that bridle). They both agree it was fun. Nistro hands Yuma "Excalibur", saying he should take it with him, but adds that if Yuma Duels like he did at the beginning again, Nistro will not forgive him. Astral says that Duelists receive the feelings of Duelists who lose and that Nistro wishes to pass his feelings onto Yuma. Yuma thanks him and Nistro says he's counting on him, while they shake hands. Back at the Duel Field's start, Tori is still waiting for Yuma and angrily yells for him to come get her.

 Yuma 
 Yuma  hits a Trap Point. It is " Cemetary Bomb ", which inflicts 100  damage  to him for each card in his  Graveyard . It damages him for an unspecified value. He changes lanes to avoid another Trap Point. He then arrives at the  Duel Field  where Nistro is waiting.

 Nistro draws. He then  Normal Summons  " Heroic Challenger - Double Lance " ( 4/1700/900) in Attack Position (Nistro: 4000 → 3800 LP). Due to the effect of "Heroic Challenger - Double Lance", it's treated as two monsters for the  Xyz Summon  of a " Heroic Champion " monster. Nistro  overlays  "Heroic Challenger - Double Lance" with itself in order to Xyz Summon " Heroic Champion - Gandiva " ( 4/2100/1800, ORU: 1) in Attack Position (Nistro: 3800 → 3600 LP). Nistro  Sets  two cards.
 Turn 2: Yuma

 Turn 3: Nistro 
Nistro draws. He then Normal Summons " Heroic Challenger - Night Watchman " ( 4/1200/300) in Attack Position (Nistro: 3600 → 3400 LP). "Heroic Challenger - Night Watchman" attacks Yuma's set monster (Nistro: 3400 → 3200 LP). Nistro then activates the effect of "Heroic Challenger - Night Watchman" to destroy Yuma's set monster (" Mogmole ") without  damage calculation  as it was in face-down  Defense Position . As it was destroyed and  sent  to the Graveyard, Yuma activates the effect of "Mogmole" to revive it ( 2/800/800) in Defense Position. Nistro activates the effect of "Heroic Champion - Gandiva" to  detach  "Heroic Challenger - Double Lance" ("Heroic Champion - Gandiva: 1 → 0 ORU) and destroy "Mogmole" (as it was a Special Summoned Level 4 or lower monster). 
 "Heroic Champion - Gandiva" attacks  directly , but Yuma activates his face-down " Battle Break " to destroy "Heroic Champion - Gandiva" and end the  Battle Phase , however Nistro activates his face-down " Battler's Pride " to negate and destroy "Battle Break" as its effect would end the Battle Phase. The direct attack continues (Yuma: 4000 → 1900 LP, Nistro: 3200 → 3000 LP). Nistro Sets a card.
 Turn 4: Yuma 
 
                 Gagaga Gunman   " Gagaga Cowboy " is Summoned.     
 Yuma draws. He then Normal Summons " Gagaga Magician " ( 4/1500/1000) in Attack Position (Yuma: 1900 → 1700 LP). Yuma then  equips  "Gagaga Magician" with " One-Shot Wand ", increasing its  ATK  by 800 ("Gagaga Magician": 1500 → 2300 ATK). "Gagaga Magician" attacks "Heroic Champion - Gandiva" (Yuma: 1700 → 1500 LP), but Nistro activates his face-down " Heroic Advance " (as a " Heroic Champion " monster was targeted for an attack) to change the attack target to "Heroic Challenger - Night Watchman" (as it's a Level 4 or lower " Heroic Challenger " monster) and double its ATK ("Heroic Challenger - Night Watchman": 1200 → 2400 ATK), but neither monster will be destroyed by this battle (Yuma: 1500 → 1400 LP). 
 After damage calculation, Yuma activates the second effect of "One-Shot Wand" to destroy it and draw a card ("Grandram"). At the end of the Battle Phase, the effect of "Heroic Advance" expires ("Heroic Challenger - Night Watchman": 2400 → 1200 ATK). Yuma Special Summons " Grandram " ( 4/0/1400) in Attack Position via its own effect as his opponent controls an  Xyz Monster  (Yuma: 1400 → 1200 LP). Yuma overlays "Gagaga Magician" and "Grandram" in order to Xyz Summon " Gagaga Cowboy " ( 4/1500/2400, ORU: 2) in Defense Position. As it is in Defense Position, Yuma activates the second effect of "Gagaga Cowboy" to detach an Overlay Unit ("Gagaga Cowboy": 2 → 1 ORU) and inflict 800 damage to Nistro (Nistro: 3000 → 2200 LP). Yuma Sets two cards.
 Turn 5: Nistro 
 
                 Heroic Champion - Kusanagi   " Heroic Champion - Kusanagi " is Summoned.     
 Nistro draws. He then equips "Heroic Champion - Gandiva" with " Xyz Crown ", which treats the Rank of "Heroic Champion - Gandiva" as its Level instead and allows it to be treated as two monsters for an Xyz Summon ("Heroic Champion - Gandiva":   4 →   4). Nistro overlays "Heroic Challenger - Night Watchman" and "Heroic Champion - Gandiva" in order to Xyz Summon " Heroic Champion - Kusanagi " ( 4/2500/2400, ORU: 2) in Attack Position (Nistro: 2200 → 2000 LP). As "Gagaga Cowboy" is in Defense Position and its DEF is higher than its ATK, Nistro activates " Fighter's Charm " to change "Gagaga Cowboy" to Attack Position and make its ATK equal to its DEF ("Gagaga Cowboy": 1500 → 2400 ATK). 
 "Heroic Champion - Kusanagi" attacks "Gagaga Cowboy" (Nistro: 2000 → 1800 LP), but Yuma activates his face-down " Overlay Buster " to increase the ATK of "Gagaga Cowboy" by 500 during the Battle Phase only, however Nistro activates the effect of "Heroic Champion - Kusanagi" to detach an Overlay Unit ("Heroic Champion - Kusanagi": 2 → 1 ORU) and negate the activation of "Overlay Buster" as well as increase the ATK of "Heroic Champion - Kusanagi" by 500 ("Heroic Champion - Kusanagi": 2500 → 3000 ATK). Yuma activates his face-down " Fighting Fund " to prevent both monsters from being destroyed by this battle (Yuma: 1200 → 600 LP). Nistro Sets two cards. On Nistro's End Phase, the effects of "Fighter's Charm" and "Heroic Champion - Kusanagi" expire ("Gagaga Cowboy": 2400 → 1500 ATK; "Heroic Champion - Kusanagi": 3000 → 2500 ATK).
 At this point, the Duel Coaster portion ends and "Desert Field" is replaced by " Sunset Showdown ". When a player has two or more monsters at the beginning of their Battle Phase, they must target one of them and destroy all monsters they control except the targeted one. Direct attacks are not allowed and each time a monster is destroyed by battle, its controller will take 300 damage.
 Turn 6: Yuma 
Yuma draws. He then activates the first effect of "Gagaga Cowboy" (as it in Attack Position) to detach an Overlay Unit ("Gagaga Cowboy": 1 → 0 ORU) and increase its ATK by 1000 as well as decrease the ATK of "Heroic Champion - Kusanagi" by 500 ("Gagaga Cowboy": 1500 → 2500 ATK; "Heroic Champion - Kusanagi": 2500 → 2000 ATK). "Gagaga Cowboy" attacks "Heroic Champion - Kusanagi", but Nistro activates his face-down " Heroic Change " to  Tribute  a " Heroic " monster and Special Summon a "Heroic" monster from his Graveyard. Nistro then activates the effect of "Heroic Champion - Kusanagi" ("Heroic Champion - Kusanagi": 1 → 0 ORU) to negate the activation of "Heroic Change" ("Heroic Champion": Kusanagi": 2000 → 2500 ATK). Both monsters are destroyed in a Double KO (Nistro: 1800 → 1500 LP, Yuma: 600 → 300 LP). 
 Since an Xyz Monster Nistro controlled battled an Xyz Monster Yuma controlled and both were destroyed by battle, Nistro activates his face-down " Xyz Xtreme !! " to  pay  1000 Life Points (Nistro: 1500 → 500 LP) and let both players Special Summon one Xyz Monster from their  Extra Deck  with the same Rank as their destroyed monster. The destroyed monsters are  attached  as Overlay Units for the new ones and the newly summoned monsters must battle with each other. Also, both summoned monsters will be destroyed at the end of the Battle Phase. Nistro Special Summons " Heroic Champion - Excalibur " ( 4/2000/2000, ORU: 1) in Attack Position and Yuma Special Summons " Number 39: Utopia " ( 4/2500/2000, ORU: 1) in Attack Position. 
 "Utopia" attacks "Heroic Champion - Excalibur", but Nistro activates the effect of "Heroic Champion - Excalibur" to detach "Heroic Champion - Kusanagi" ("Heroic Champion - Excalibur": 1 → 0 ORU) and double its ATK ("Heroic Champion - Excalibur": 2000 → 4000 ATK). Yuma activates the effect of "Utopia" to detach "Gagaga Cowboy" ("Utopia": 1 → 0 ORU) and negate the attack. Since the attack of "Utopia" was negated, Yuma activates " Double or Nothing! " to double the ATK of "Utopia" ("Utopia": 2500 → 5000 ATK) and allow it to attack again. "Utopia" attacks and destroys "Heroic Champion - Excalibur" (Nistro: 500 → 0 LP).
