 Saffira, Queen of Dragons  is a character version of the card " Saffira, Queen of Dragons ". 
 She appears as a Super Rare Partner available in  Yu-Gi-Oh! Duel Arena , with a default of 5 Rental Points. Her partner ID is P134.
 She was only obtainable by one of two ways. One was by achieving any Rank from 1 to 100 on the Arena Weekly Win Ratings (Single) for the time period of January 12, 2015, 00:00 (UTC) through January 18, 2015, 23:59 (UTC). Applicable players received her in their Gift Boxes after maintenance on January 21, 2015.
 The second way was by winning at least 10 times in Arena mode (Single Round only), during the time period of February 9, 2015, 00:00 (UTC) through February 15, 2015, 23:59 (UTC). This was in compensation for a mix-up during the previous month's "1-week Arena Challenge!" event, as the silhouette of  Baxia, Brightness of the Yang Zing  was accidentally used in its promotions instead of this character's silhouette. Applicable players received her in their Gift Boxes after maintenance on February 18, 2015. Players who already had this partner at this point had its Rental Point maximum increased by 1 and simultaneously refreshed.

 Trivia 
 This partner was initially planned to be the only reward for the top 100 players in the "1-week Arena Challenge!" event for January 2015. However, since the silhouette of  Baxia, Brightness of the Yang Zing  was accidentally used in promotions advertising the event, Baxia, Brightness of the Yang Zing was also included as a reward for those players.
 This is likely related to the fact that this partner's Deck name (Queen's Blessings) was accidentally used as Baxia's Deck name before this partner was released, an error that was fixed during the same maintenance that awarded this partner.
