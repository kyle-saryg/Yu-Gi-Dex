      The Fusionizer     
 The  Fusionizer  is a device capable of fusing dimensions. It was created by the  Barian  deity  Don Thousand  in the  Yu-Gi-Oh! ZEXAL  anime to fuse the  Barian World  and  Human World  using a million  Barian Numbers  stored within it. The device is not named in the Japanese version.
 
 History 
 Don Thousand constructed this device and hid it in his  palace . After his awakening, he showed it to  Vector  after guiding the  Barian Emperor  into the building. He explained that the device he can fuse the Barian World and Earth. This can be done once the level of hatred on Earth equals that of the Barian World. This process would assist in the destruction of the Astral World, as according to Don Thousand, it would boost his power to overwhelming levels. [1] 
 However, the Barian Numbers stored within the device was not enough to accomplish this task, so Thousand was forced to anchor his host, Vector to the throne of his palace to focus their energies on creating more of them. [1] 
 After the defeat of the first three members of the  Fearsome Four of the Dark Dueling World , enough time had passed and many cards were manufactured. They used  Mr. Heartland  to spread the resulting Barian Numbers across Earth. [2] [3] 
 This machine was Don Thousand's ultimate machination to obtain the  Numeron Code . By fusing the Human World and Barian World, the Numeron Code (which was on Earth, though he did not know its exact location) would become part of the Barian World. Don Thousand's powers as the deity of the Barian World, allowed him to obtain the Code's power, despite not knowing its location. In doing so, he was able to activate and wield the code's power  without  collecting all the " Numbers ". [4]
