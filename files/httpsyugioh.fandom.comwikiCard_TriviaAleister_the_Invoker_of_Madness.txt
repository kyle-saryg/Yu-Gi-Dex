 This is " Aleister the Invoker " turning into " Invoked Caliga ". 
 This monster may be the result of "Aleister the Invoker" using " The Book of the Law " to create some kind of ritual as seen in " Magical Meltdown " which drove him to madness
 This is supported by the  TCG  name while the  OCG  name, "Aleister the Meltdown Invoker", further supports this idea
