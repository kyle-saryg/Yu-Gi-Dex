 An  A-Counter  is visible within the tube of this card's art. 
 The Spanish print of this card uses the English TCG name of the  Alien  archetype instead of the Spanish one (" Alienígena "). Another telltale of its straight translation from the English lore is its name, as it uses the world " celda " instead of " célula " for " cell ".
