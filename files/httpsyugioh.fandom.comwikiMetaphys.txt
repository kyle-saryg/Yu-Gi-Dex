 " Metaphys " (メタファイズ  Metafaizu ) is an  archetype  of  LIGHT   Wyrm   monsters  that debuted in  Duelist Alliance  but did not have any support until  Circuit Break . With the exception of "Metaphys Executor", they are all counterparts to existing monsters from the  Duel Monsters  and  GX  eras of  Yu-Gi-Oh .
 " Metaphysical Regeneration " has been renamed in order to exclude it from the archetype in the  TCG . The inclusion of cards whose names contain the feminine word "Metafisica" (e.g. " Ascensione Metafisica ") seems to be implicit in the Italian version because their names don't contain "Metafisico".

 Playing style 
 The Effect Monsters revolve around banishing each other and gaining advantage upon being banished. Some of them gain an additional effect when Special Summoned by the effect of a "Metaphys" monster. Their effects are quite diverse, ranging from the search of resources to the mass removal of monsters or spells and traps. Due to the mechanic revolving around their banishment, they have synergy with effects like that of " Sacred Sword of Seven Stars ", " D.D. Sprite ", " Gold Sarcophagus ", etc.
 "Metaphys Executor" banishes 5 different "Metaphys" cards for its summon, so it is a good idea to use " Necroface " to recycle those cards for later use. " Metaphys Armed Dragon " can be used as a material for "Executor" and you can get it back by using "Metaphys Dimension" or the Level 10 "Metaphys" monster itself.
