 Summary 
 Alexis Rhodes  is set to Duel  Aster Phoenix . The fate of the  Slifer Red  dorm hangs in the balance. If Aster wins, then it will be demolished. If Alexis wins the dorm remains.  Vice-Chancellor Bonaparte  is confident that Aster will win, being a  Pro League  Duelist. Aster is slightly confused, however. He had met  Chazz Princeton , prior to the Duel, who had assumed that  Sartorius  had sent Aster to help recruit more members for the  Society of Light  (in the dub he assumed he was there to defeat Jaden again). Aster has no clue what Chazz is talking about, despite Sartorius being his manager.  Jaden Yuki  finally makes it back to  Duel Academy  and is lead by a light into a cave. He meets another  Neo Spacian  there, and then hurries to the Academy. He takes Alexis' place in the Duel, and his rematch with Aster begins. Aster uses his " Destiny Heroes " again, and Jaden unveils  Contact Fusion , which the "Neo-Spacians" can use to fuse with " Elemental Hero Neos " without " Polymerization ". However, even he was unaware that this results in the  Fusion Monster  returning to the  Fusion Deck  at the  End Phase , and is reduced to 200  Life Points  via  direct attacks  as a result. Aster is confident he will win since Jaden has no clue on how to use his new cards, but Jaden refuses to give up and the dorm's fate hangs in Jaden's hands.
 
 Featured Duel: Jaden Yuki vs. Aster Phoenix 
 Turn 1: Aster 
Aster draws " Destiny Hero - Diamond Dude " and subsequently Normal Summons it (1400/1600) in  Attack Position . He then activates the effect of "Diamond Dude" to reveal the top card of his Deck. If that card is a Normal Spell Card, it will be sent to the Graveyard, and Aster can activate its effect on his next turn's Main Phase. He reveals " Graceful Charity ", so it is  sent  to the Graveyard.
 Turn 2: Jaden 
Jaden draws " Neo-Spacian Aqua Dolphin " and subsequently Normal Summons it (600/800) in Attack Position. He then activates " Fake Hero " to  Special Summon  " Elemental Hero Bladedge " (2600/1800) in Attack Position, however it won't be allowed to attack this turn. Jaden then activates "Aqua Dolphin's" effect to  discard  " Hero Kid ", look at Aster's hand, and choose a monster in it. If that monster has less ATK than a monster Jaden controls, that monster will be destroyed and Aster will take 500  damage . Jaden chooses " Destiny Hero - Captain Tenacious " (800/800) and it is subsequently destroyed (Aster 4000 → 3500). Jaden then  Sets  two cards. During the End Phase, "Bladedge" returns to Jaden's  hand  due to "Fake Hero".
 Turn 3: Aster 
Aster draws. Through the effect of "Destiny Hero - Diamond Dude", Aster activates the effect of " Graceful Charity " from his  Graveyard ,  drawing  three cards and discarding two (" Destiny Hero - Doom Lord " and " Ring of Magnetism "). Aster then activates " Mausoleum of the Emperor ". Now both players can Normal Summon monsters without Tributing by paying 500  Life Points  times the number of monsters needed to  Tribute Summon  that monster(s). [Notes 1] 
 Aster uses the effect of "Mausoleum of the Emperor" to  pay  1000  Life Points  (Aster 3500 → 2500) and Normal Summon " Destiny Hero - Dreadmaster " (?/?) in Attack Position without Tributing. Since "Destiny Hero - Dreadmaster" was summoned, its first effect activates, allowing Aster to Special Summon "Captain Tenacious" (800/800) and "Doom Lord" (600/800) from his Graveyard in Attack Position. [Notes 2]  Due to the last effect of "Dreadmaster", its ATK and DEF are equal to the combined original ATK of all other Destiny Heroes that Aster controls ("Dreadmaster": ? → 2800/? → 2800) . "Dreadmaster" attacks "Aqua Dolphin", but Jaden activates his face-down " Negate Attack " to negate the attack and end Aster's  Battle Phase .
 Turn 4: Jaden 
Jaden draws "Elemental Hero Neos". He then uses the effect of "Mausoleum of the Emperor" to pay 1000 Life Points (Jaden 4000 → 3000) and Normal Summon " Elemental Hero Neos " (2500/2000) in Attack Position without Tributing. Jaden then Contact Fuses "Neos" with "Aqua Dolphin" in order to Special Summon " Elemental Hero Aqua Neos " (2500/2000) in Attack Position. He then activates the effect of "Aqua Neos" to discard "Bladedge" and destroy two random cards in Aster's hand. [Notes 3] 
 Jaden then activates his face-down " H - Heated Heart " to increase the ATK of "Aqua Neos" by 500 for this turn ("Aqua Neos": 2500 → 3000/2000) and grant it the ability to inflict  piercing  damage this turn. "Aqua Neos" attacks and destroys "Dreadmaster" (Aster 2500 → 2300). On the End Phase, the final effect of "Aqua Neos" activates, returning it to Jaden's  Fusion Deck .
 Turn 5: Aster 
Aster draws. "Doom Lord", "Diamond Dude", and "Captain Tenacious" all attack directly (Jaden 3000 → 2400 → 1000 → 200).
 Duel continues in  the next episode .

 Differences in adaptations 
 The flashback where Sartorius accompanies Aster at his father's grave is removed from the dub. 
 In the original, Napoleon tells Cronos that he managed to get Edo to come to duel academy by lying that he can get information about his father's killer from a boss in the dueling underworld. In the dub, this was changed to Bonaparte having a series of acquaintences that eventually led to him getting contact with Sartorius. 
 Mistakes 
         Jaden draws " Mausoleum of the Emperor ".     
 When turn 4 begins,  Jaden  draws "Mausoleum of the Emperor" instead of " Elemental Hero Neos ". This wasn't corrected in the dub. 
 On numerous occasions, " Chrysalis Dolphin " can be seen on Jaden's  Duel Disk , instead of " Neo-Spacian Aqua Dolphin ". 
 Errors 
 In the English dub, when Jaden explains the effect of " Elemental Hero Aqua Neos ," he incorrectly says that the card  destroys  two cards from the opponent's  Deck . "Aqua Neos" destroys two cards from the opponent's  hand . 
 Notes 
 
 ↑   In the TCG/OCG, one must  pay  1000  Life Points  per  Tribute  being replaced with " Mausoleum of the Emperor ". 
 
 ↑   In the TCG/OCG, "Dreadmaster's" effect only activates after being Special Summoned by the effect of " Clock Tower Prison ". 
 
 ↑   In the TCG/OCG, the effect of " Elemental Hero Aqua Neos " only forces the opponent to  destroy  1 card in his/her hand. 
 
 ↑  4.0   4.1   This card can be seen on the top of his Deck before the Duel.
