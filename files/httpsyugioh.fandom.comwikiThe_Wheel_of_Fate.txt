 Events 
 When  Jonouchi  took part in  The Get the Million Game , the  producer  had a  technician  ready to push a button on a switchboard to rig the wheel to not stop on the "¥1,000,000" section. The button was colored red. However  Dark Yugi  distracted the technician by dropping a bucket of paint on his head. The producer then went to push the button, but the red paint had covered the switchboard, so he couldn't tell which one needed to be pushed. Jonouchi told the wheel to stop and it landed on the "¥1,000,000" section. [1] 
 The company went bankrupt before Jonouchi cashed the check making it useless. [1]
