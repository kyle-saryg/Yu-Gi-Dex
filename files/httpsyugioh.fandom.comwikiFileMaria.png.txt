 Maria Bartlet , known simply as  Maria  in the Japanese version, is a primary level teacher at the  Duel Academy  in  New Domino City , who teaches classes for child students. Among her students are  Leo ,  Luna ,  Dexter ,  Bob ,  Patty  and  Sly .
 Miss Bartlet was against Heitmann when he wanted to expel her students regardless of his threat about telling the Chancellor that they weed out the faculty (because he thinks the students are terrible because of her). She became worried about  Yusei  Dueling  Heitmann , knowing how strong his Deck is, but  Akiza  assured her that Yusei could win against him.
 
       Lester  disguises as Maria with her eyes are drawn differently     
 She introduces  Lester  as a new transfer student. Lester disguises himself as Miss Bartlet, to trick Leo into waiting for her after school. When the real Miss Bartlet saw Leo waiting in the classroom she asked him what he was still doing at school and stated he should really should go home. Upon finding this out, Leo realizes that he had been tricked.
 She appears to be almost humble by personality, but she appears to have a slight strictness in her personality as evident by the fact that she scolded  Leo  when he complained about trying to summon his " Power Tool Dragon " during a Dueling lesson (they were using  Warrior  Decks for the lesson).
