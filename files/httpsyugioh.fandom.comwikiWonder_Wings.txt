 Changes 
 Episode 125  - A sound is added when the  Yu-Gi-Oh! ZEXAL  logo appears and when  ZEXAL III  draws a card. More cards were added at the beginning. Also,  Nash ,  Marin , " Number C101: Silent Honor DARK ", " Number C102: Archfiend Seraph " and " Number C103: Ragnafinity " are no longer obscured. 
  Episode 131  -  Don Thousand 's eye now appears in the background when  Shark  is gazing at the waterfall. When Marin appears alongside Nash, she shatters away. The montage of character images as  Yuma  and  Astral  remember moments from the series now zooms out, rather than staying still. The shot at the end showcasing the cast with  Earth  as a backdrop has been altered.
