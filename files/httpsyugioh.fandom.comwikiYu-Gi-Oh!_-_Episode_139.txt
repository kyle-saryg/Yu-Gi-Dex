 Summary 
 Featured Duel: Yami Marik vs. Yami Yugi - Part 2 
 Duel continues from previous episode. 
 Yami Yugi has 3300  Life Points  remaining and controls "Slifer the Sky Dragon" (6000/6000) in Attack Position and one set card.
 Yami Marik has 4000 Life Points remaining and controls "The Winged Dragon of Ra" (0/0) as Egyptian God Phoenix in Attack Position and three set cards.
 Turn 6: Yami Yugi 
 Yami Marik  has just managed to  Special Summon  " The Winged Dragon of Ra " in  Phoenix Mode . Since a  monster  was  summoned  on Yami Marik's side of the  field , the second mouth effect of " Slifer the Sky Dragon "'  activates , which would lower the ATK of "The Winged Dragon of Ra" by 2000, but it doesn't work as the second mouth effect of "Slifer the Sky Dragon" can't affect "The Winged Dragon of Ra" while it's in  Phoenix Mode . 
 Yami Marik then activates the effect of "The Winged Dragon of Ra" to  pay  1000 Life Points ( Marik  4000 → 3000) to attack and destroy "Slifer the Sky Dragon". "The Winged Dragon of Ra" then  returns  to Marik's  Graveyard . Yami Marik then activates his face-down " Zombie's Jewel " to add " Monster Reborn " from  Yugi 's  Graveyard  to his  hand  and allow Yami Yugi to  draw  a card (Aside from "Monster Reborn", Yami Marik's hand is shown to contain " Bait Doll " and " Mask of Remnants ".) Without looking at it, Yami Yugi  sets  the card he drew (NOTE:  Ishizu  mentally reveals the card is "Fiend's Sanctuary", the card  Seto  gave Yugi before the  Duel  started.) 
 Turn 7: Yami Marik 
Yami Marik draws. He then activates "Monster Reborn" to revive "The Winged Dragon of Ra" (0/0) in Attack Position. Yami Marik then pays all but 1 of his Life Points ( Yami Marik  3000 → 1), in order to activate the second effect of "The Winged Dragon of Ra", increasing its ATK and DEF by the total amount of  Life Points  paid ("The Winged Dragon of Ra": 0 → 2999/0 → 2999). This effectively "fuses" Yami Marik with Ra. Yami Marik then  Tributes  " Juragedo " in order to activate another effect of "The Winged Dragon of Ra", transferring the tributed monster's ATK and DEF to itself, i.e. increasing "Ra's" ATK/DEF by the total amount of  ATK / DEF  tributed ("The Winged Dragon of Ra": 2999 → 4699/2999 → 4299). 
 "The Winged Dragon of Ra"  attacks   directly , but Yami Yugi activates his face-down " Fiend's Sanctuary " to  Special Summon  a " Metal Fiend Token " (0/0) in Attack Position. Yami Yugi explains to Yami Marik that this token will block Yami Marik's attack and when it does, any  Battle Damage  inflicted to Yami Yugi will be redirected to Yami Marik instead. Yami Marik activates his face-down " De-Fusion " in order to separate himself from "The Winged Dragon of Ra" and stop the attack. By doing so, the  ATK  of "Ra" is added back to Yami Marik's Life Points ( Yami Marik  1 → 4700). "The Winged Dragon of Ra" then  returns  to Yami Marik's  Graveyard  since it was revived. Yami Marik then  Sets  a card.
 Turn 8: Yami Yugi 
Yami Yugi draws. On Yami Yugi's Standby Phase, he pays 1000 Life Points ( Yugi  3300 → 2300) to keep his "Metal Fiend Token" on the field. Yami Yugi activates his face-down " Multiply " to  Special Summon  two more "Metal Fiend Tokens" (0/0) in Attack Position. He then Tributes his three "Metal Fiend Tokens" in order to  Tribute Summon  " Obelisk the Tormentor " (4000/4000) in Attack Position. "Obelisk the Tormentor" attacks directly.  
 Duel continues next episode. 
 
 Differences in adaptations 
 A close-up pan of  Yami Yugi  and  Yugi  screaming in flames from the attack made by " Ra " is cut from the dub. 
 The star of " Fiend's Sanctuary " is given more points in the dub. 
 After  Yami Marik  used " De-Fusion " to separate himself from Ra, cut is a pan of his side of the field. 
 When  Yami Marik  wonders if  Yami Yugi  drew the card that  Kaiba  gave him from the second effect of " Zombie's Jewel ",  Kaiba  throwing the card to Yami is added in the dub. 
 When Yami Marik's hand of cards is shown close-up while holding Monster Reborn, the other two Japanese cards are Bait Doll and The Mask of Remnants. The dub shows Fiend's Sanctuary and Card of Last Will. 
 Cut from the English version is a scene where  Kaiba  wonders if  Yugi  will summon a miracle. Then, Isono attempts to stop the game, telling  Yami Yugi  it's against the rules to set a card without knowing what it is—if it's a monster card, it's in the wrong slot. But  Kaiba  thinks it's interesting, and tells Isono to let them duel. 
 After summoning Obelisk The Tormentor, Yami Yugi says in his mind that it was "Summoned with the help of two of his friends" and the image of Yugi and Kaiba were added. In the Japanese version, neither of this happens. 
 Mistakes 
 In a close up of Yami Marik's hand holding Monster Reborn after activating "Zombie's Jewel", it is seen that he has the magic card "Fiend's Sanctuary" even though Kaiba said that only he has that card (in Episode 137). 
 When Yami Yugi first drew and placed his "Fiend's Sanctuary" without looking at it, he has another magic or trap card in his Duel Disk, but after the commercial break, when placing Fiend's Sanctuary again, only his newly placed card is shown in a slot. However, when this card solidifies on the field, the other card is shown as well face-down, yet still not in a slot of his Duel Disk. 
 Trivia 
 This is the first episode where all three Egyptian God Cards are used in the same duel.
