 Summary 
 After  Bastion Misawa 's  defeat  by  Tania , the rest of the group camps outside overnight. Eventually Bastion emerges, and states that he had Dueled with Tania using each of his Decks, but had not won a single match. Unable to prove himself, she eventually kicked him out. The next day, Bastion is still depressed because he lost against Tania. Jaden challenges him to Duel to cheer him up, but he declines. That night, they enter the coliseum again, and Jaden challenges Tania, who tells him they'll be married if he loses. Jaden chooses her "Deck of Courage" and the Duel begins. Tania's " Amazoness Arena "  Field Spell Card  allows both Duelists to pay 100  Life Points  after a battle to inflict 100 damage to the opponent. Both Tania and Jaden constantly do so, both being extremely headstrong. Jaden eventually wins by using said effect when he had 200 Life Points, and Tania had only 100. Tania takes her true form, that of a White Tiger, and departs with her own pet tiger, Bass. Bastion finally returns to normal as well.
 
 Featured Duels 
 Bastion Misawa vs. Tania 
 Duel already in progress.  Bastion  has 1000  Life Points .
 Bastion's Life Points are  damaged  through unknown means (Bastion 1000 → 0).
 
 Jaden Yuki vs. Tania 
 Turn 1: Jaden 
Jaden draws " Elemental HERO Avian " and subsequently Normal Summons it (1000/1000) in  Defense Position .
 Turn 2: Tania 
Tania draws " Amazoness Paladin " and subsequently Normal Summons it (1700/300) in  Attack Position . Due to the effect of "Amazoness Paladin", it gains 100 ATK for every " Amazoness " monster Tania controls. She has one, so "Amazoness Paladin" gains 100 ATK ("Amazoness Paladin": 1700 → 1800/300). Tania then  activates  " Amazoness Charm " to switch "Avian" to Attack Position and increase its ATK by 200 ("Avian": 1000 → 1200/1000). 
 Tania then activates " Amazoness Arena ", which increases both players'  Life Points  by 600 upon activation (Jaden 4000 → 4600; Tania 4000 → 4600). Now when a monster attacks, both players can pay 100 Life Points at the end of the Damage Step to inflict 100 damage to their opponents. "Amazoness Paladin" attacks and  destroys  "Avian" (Jaden 4600 → 4000). The effect of "Amazoness Arena" activates and both players pay 100 Life Points (Jaden 4000 → 3900; Tania 4600 → 4500) before damage is inflicted (Jaden 3900 → 3800; Tania 4500 → 4400).
 Turn 3: Jaden 
Jaden draws " Polymerization " and subsequently activates it to fuse " Elemental HERO Sparkman " with " Elemental HERO Clayman " in order to  Fusion Summon  " Elemental HERO Thunder Giant " (2400/1500) in Attack Position. 
 Since "Thunder Giant" was summoned, its effect activates, allowing Jaden to destroy "Amazoness Paladin". [Notes 1]  "Thunder Giant" attacks  directly  (Tania 4400 → 2000).
 Turn 4: Tania 
Tania draws " Amazoness Archers " and subsequently  Sets  it. She then Normal Summons " Amazoness Swords Woman " (1500/1600) in Attack Position. Tania then activates " Amazoness Call " to return "Thunder Giant" to the Fusion Deck and  Special Summon  "Clayman" (800/2000) and "Sparkman" (1600/1400) from Jaden's Graveyard to his side of the field in Attack Position. 
 "Amazoness Swords Woman" attacks and destroys "Clayman" (Jaden 3800 → 3100). The effect of "Amazoness Arena" activates and both players pay 100 Life Points (Jaden 3100 → 3000; Tania 2000 → 1900) before damage is inflicted (Jaden 3000 → 2900; Tania 1900 → 1800).
 Turn 5: Jaden 
Jaden draws " Elemental HERO Burstinatrix " and subsequently Normal Summons it (1200/800) in Attack Position. 
 "Sparkman" attacks "Amazoness Swords Woman", but Tania activates her face-down "Amazoness Archers" to decrease the ATK of all of Jaden's monsters by 600 ("Elemental Hero Sparkman": 1600 → 1000/1400; "Elemental Hero Burstinatrix": 1200 → 600/800) and force them all to attack. "Amazoness Swords Woman" destroys "Sparkman" (Jaden 2900 → 2400) [Notes 2] . The effect of "Amazoness Arena" activates and both players pay 100 Life Points (Jaden 2400 → 2300; Tania 1800 → 1700) before damage is inflicted (Jaden 2300 → 2200; Tania 1700 → 1600). 
 "Burstinatrix" attacks "Amazoness Swords Woman". "Amazoness Swords Woman" destroys "Burstinatrix" (Jaden 2200 → 1300). The effect of "Amazoness Arena" activates and both players pay 100 Life Points (Jaden 1300 → 1200; Tania 1600 → 1500) before damage is inflicted (Jaden 1200 → 1100; Tania 1500 → 1400). Jaden then sets two cards. He then activates " The Warrior Returning Alive " to return "Clayman" from his  Graveyard  to his hand.
 Turn 6: Tania 
Tania draws " Amazoness Tiger " and subsequently Normal Summons it (1100/1500) in Attack Position. Due to the effect of "Amazoness Tiger", it gains 400 ATK for every "Amazoness" monster Tania controls. Tania currently has two ("Amazoness Tiger": 1100 → 1900/1500). 
 "Amazoness Swords Woman" attacks directly, but Jaden activates his face-down " A Hero Emerges " to force Tania to choose a random card in Jaden's hand. If it's a monster, Jaden can Special Summon it. Tania selects the only card in Jaden's hand and Jaden Special Summons "Clayman (800/2000) in  Defense Position . 
 A  replay  occurs, and Tania uses "Amazoness Swords Woman" to attack "Clayman". The attack fails, but due to the effect of "Amazoness Swords Woman", Jaden takes all  Battle Damage  that Tania would have taken (Jaden 1100 → 600). The effect of "Amazoness Arena" activates and both players pay 100 Life Points (Jaden 600 → 500; Tania 1400 → 1300) before damage is inflicted (Jaden 500 → 400; Tania 1300 → 1200).
 "Amazoness Tiger" attacks "Clayman". The attack fails (Tania 1200 → 1100). The effect of "Amazoness Arena" activates and both players pay 100 Life Points (Jaden 400 → 300; Tania 1100 → 1000) before damage is inflicted (Jaden 300 → 200; Tania 1000 → 900). 
 Since "Amazoness Tiger" attacked a monster and it didn't destroy it, Tania activates " Amazoness Trainer " to increase the ATK of "Amazoness Tiger" by 400 ("Amazoness Tiger": 1900 → 2300/1500) and allow it to attack again. "Amazoness Tiger" attacks "Clayman", but Jaden activates his face-down " Clay Charge " to destroy "Clayman" and "Amazoness Tiger" and inflict 800 damage to Tania (Tania 900 → 100).
 Turn 7: Jaden 
Jaden draws " Elemental HERO Wildheart " and subsequently Normal Summons it (1500/1600) in Attack Position. "Wildheart" attacks "Swords Woman". Both monsters are destroyed in a  Double KO . The effect of "Amazoness Arena" activates and Jaden pays 100 Life Points (Jaden 200 → 100) in order to activate its effect (Tania 100 → 0).
 
 Mistakes 
 During the duel after " Amazoness Swords Woman " and " Elemental Hero Wildheart " are both destroyed in the dub,  Alexis  said that  Tania  was down to her last 100 attack points when she should have said Life Points.
