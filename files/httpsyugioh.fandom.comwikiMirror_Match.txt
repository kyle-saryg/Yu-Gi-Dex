A  Mirror Match  is a Duel played between two people whose Decks are nearly identical, use cards from the same  archetypes , or focus on roughly the same strategy. 
 A first example would be two Duelists using an identical/nearly identical Deck, like when (in the anime)  Yugi  and  Yami Yugi  dueled in  Episode 163  (where the only card that made a difference between both Duelists' Decks was " The Seal of Orichalcos "). In  Yu-Gi-Oh! Duelists of the Roses  and  Yu-Gi-Oh! Forbidden Memories ,  Deck Master K  uses a Deck identical to yours as well.
 A second example would be two Duelists focusing on the same concept while using different cards, such as both players using the " Exodia " cards while using different draw engines, or both focusing on  burn  effects while using different burn engines.
 A third example would be using cards from the same archetype differently, such as one player using the material-specific " Elemental HERO " Fusions (" Shining Flare "/" Flame Wingman ", " Rampart Blaster ", " Thunder Giant ", etc.) and one player using the "Omni HERO" (unofficial term) Fusions (" Absolute Zero ", " Nova Master ", ' The Shining ", etc.), in which case both would have relatively the same Main Decks but different Extra Decks.
