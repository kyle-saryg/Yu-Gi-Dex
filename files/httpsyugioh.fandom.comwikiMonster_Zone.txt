 Monster Zones  (モンスターゾーン  Monsutā Zōn ), formerly  Monster Card Zones  (モンスターカードゾーン  Monsutā Kādo Zōn ), are the  zones  where  monsters  are placed on the  field . There are two types of Monster Zones:  Main Monster Zones  and  Extra Monster Zones .
 On game mats, Main Monster Zones are located in the upper-middle and are often colored brown. Extra Monster Zones are located in the center of the field and are colored blue.
 
 Mechanics 
 Cards on the field are treated as monsters if and only if they are in a Monster Zone. Monster Cards on the field are not treated as monsters if they are in other zones (such as the  Spell & Trap Zone ). Likewise,  Spell  and  Trap Cards  in the Monster Zones are treated as monsters (although  Trap Monsters  are still treated as Trap Cards as well, but they do not occupy two zones).  Xyz Materials  are not considered to be in a Monster Zone.
 Monsters Summoned/Set from any zones other than the Extra Deck (Deck, Hand, Graveyard, Spell & Trap, Banished cards, Tokens) must be Special Summoned to the Main Monster Zones. Fusion, Synchro and Xyz Monsters may be Summoned to either the Main or Extra Monster Zones. Link Monsters and Pendulum Monsters Pendulum Summoned from face-up in Extra Deck must be Summoned to an Extra Monster Zone, or a Main Monster Zone pointed to by Link Monsters'  Link Arrows .
 A monster cannot be Summoned unless there is an appropriate Monster Zone to Summon that monster in, unless performing its Summon would cause an appropriate Monster Zone to become available. For example, even if all of a player's  Main Monster Zones  are occupied, that player can still  Tribute Summon  a monster to their field as long as they  Tribute  at least one monster in their Main Monster Zones. Likewise, even if the opponent controls monsters in both  Extra Monster Zones  due to achieving an  Extra Link , the player can still Summon a monster to an Extra Monster Zone as long as one of the Extra Monster Zones becomes available when performing the Summon (such as by using a monster in an Extra Monster Zone as  material ).
 If control of a monster is changed or a temporarily  banished  monster  returns  to the field, it is placed in its controller's  Main Monster Zone  (regardless of its original zone). If there is no available Main Monster Zone, that monster is  sent  to the  Graveyard  by  game mechanics .
 The player who performs the Summon or  Set , regardless of who will control the Summoned monster, decides which Monster Zone the monster is Summoned/Set in. The player must decide which zone the monster will be Summoned/Set in when they declare the Summon/Set, before the  timing to negate the Summon .
 Monsters cannot be moved between Monster Zones, except by a card effect such as " Senet Switch ".
