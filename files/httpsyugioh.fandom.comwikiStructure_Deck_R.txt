 Structure Deck R  is a series of  Structure Decks  in the  OCG  that take a theme from older  Structure Decks  and improves them for the modern era. So far, all of the decks in the series are based on the 9th deck ( Structure Deck: Dinosaur's Rage ) and onward. Each  Structure Deck R  also features at least one  retrained version  of a monster from the older  Structure Decks  they are based on.
 In the  TCG , these Decks are released as part of the same series that other  Structure Decks  are, as opposed to having their own  Structure Deck  series. However, a few of the decks have been skipped, with new cards included in special boosters.
