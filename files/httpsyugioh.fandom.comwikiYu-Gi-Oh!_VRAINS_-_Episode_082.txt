" Gored ", known as " What's Beyond Instincts " in the Japanese version, is the eighty-second episode of  Yu-Gi-Oh! VRAINS  anime. It aired in Japan on December 19, 2018. It aired on Teletoon on June 21, 2020.
 Playmaker  has somehow survived  the Gore 's brutal attack. He attempts to turn things around with his  Skill , but the Gore then negates it with Anti-Skill. Playmaker is now totally driven into a corner. Is there any way he can get out of this one?!
 
 Featured Duel: Playmaker vs. The Gore 
 Duel continues from the previous episode . 
 Turn 3: The Gore 
The effect of " G Golem Crystal Heart " increases the ATK of all  EARTH  monsters it points to by 600 for each G Golem Counter on it (" Dinowrestler King T Wrextle ": 3000 → 3600 ATK).  The Gore   Normal Summons  " Dinowrestler Valeonyx " (1600/0). The Gore then activates the effect of "Valeonyx", targeting "King T Wrextle" and making it unaffected by the effects of  Link Monsters  with equal or lower Link Rating than it. The Gore  sets  a card. 
 "King T Wrextle"  attacks  " Storm Cipher ", with the effect of " World Dino Wrestling " increasing its ATK by 200 during damage calculation only as it is declaring an attack ("King T Wrextle": 3600 → 3800 ATK). "Storm Cipher" is destroyed ( Playmaker : 4000 → 2600 LP). The effect of " Crazy Evolution " activates in The Gore's GY as the targeted "Storm Cipher" left the field, allowing The Gore to banish it to draw a card.
 Turn 4: Playmaker 
Playmaker Normal Summons " Dotscaper " (0/2100). Playmaker uses "Dotscaper" to  Link Summon  " Linkuriboh " (300/LINK-1/↓) to the  Extra Monster Zone . As it was sent to the GY, "Dotscaper"s effect lets Playmaker Special Summon it in  Defense Position . Playmaker uses "Dotscaper" and " Boot Staggered " to Link Summon " Security Dragon " (1100/LINK-2/↓↑) to the zone "Linkuriboh" points to. Playmaker activates the effect of "Security Dragon" as it is co-linked, allowing Playmaker to return a monster his opponent controls to the hand. Playmaker attempts to return "King T Wrextle", but the effect of "Valeonyx" prevents "King T Wrextle" from being affected by the effects of monsters that have equal or fewer Link Markers than it. As he controls at least two Link Monsters, Playmaker Special Summons " Cross Debug " (900/600) from his hand in Attack Position via its own effect. Playmaker uses " Linkslayer ", "Cross Debug" and "Security Dragon" to Link Summon " Firewall Dragon " (2500/LINK-4/←↑↓→) to the zone "Linkuriboh" points to. Playmaker activates the effect of "Firewall Dragon" as it is co-linked, allowing Playmaker to return monsters from the field or GY to the hand equal to the number of monsters it is co-linked with. Playmaker targets "King T Wrextle". The Gore activates his set " Dino Deceit " as Playmaker controls a Link Monster with more Link Markers than a "Dinowrestler" Link Monster he controls, allowing The Gore to negate the effects of all monsters Playmaker controls. The effects of "Firewall Dragon" and "Linkuriboh" are negated. The other effect of "Dino Deceit" lets The Gore set a Spell or Trap card from his hand face-down.  
 Playmaker enters his Battle Phase, as the last effect of "Dino Deceit" forces him to enter it. At the start of Playmaker's Battle Phase, The Gore activates the effect of "King T Wrextle", targeting a monster Playmaker controls. That monster must attack before other monsters Playmaker controls, and if it does not attack, it is destroyed at the end of the Battle Phase. The Gore targets "Firewall Dragon", and Playmaker chooses not to attack so "Firewall Dragon" is destroyed. 
 Turn 5: The Gore 
The Gore sets a card. The Gore then activates his Set  Continouous Trap Card  " Dino Domain ", allowing him to Once per Turn return a "Dinowrestler" monster he controls to the hand to make all his monsters unaffected by the effects of Playmaker's monsters until the End Phase. Additionally, while he controls a monster in an Extra Monster Zone, "Dino Domain" cannot be targeted or destroyed by effects. The Gore returns "King T Wrextle" to his  Extra Deck . The Gore activates the effect of "Crystal Heart", Special Summoning " Dinowrestler Terra Parkourio " from his GY to the zone "Crystal Heart" points to and then placing a G Golem Counter on "Crystal Heart" ("Crystal Heart" G Golem Counters: 1 → 2). The effect of "Crystal Heart" increases the ATK of all EARTH monsters it points to by 600 for each G Golem Conter on it ("Terra Parkourio": 1000 → 2200 ATK). The Gore uses "Valeonyx" and "Terra Parkourio" to Link Summon "Dinowrestler King T Wrextle" to the zone "Crystal Heart" points to ("King T Wrextle": 3000 → 4200 ATK). As it was sent to the GY to Link Summon, the effect of "Terra Parkourio" lets The Gore Special Summon a "Dinowrestler" from his GY with its effects negated. The Gore Special Summons "Valeonyx" in Defense Position. 
 "King T Wrextle" attacks "Linkuriboh", with the effect of "World Dino Wrestling" increasing its ATK by 200 during damage calculation only as it is declaring an attack ("King T Wrextle": 4200 → 4400 ATK). Playmaker activates the effect of "Cross Debug" from the GY by banishing itself and targeting "Firewall Dragon", making "Linkuriboh" unable to be destroyed by battle and increasing its ATK by the ATK of "Firewall Dragon" until the end of the Damage Step ("Linkuriboh": 300 → 2800 ATK). The attack continues and "Linkuriboh" is not destroyed (Playmaker: 2600 → 1000 LP).
 Turn 6: Playmaker 
Playmaker draws " Grid Sweeper ". Playmaker activates his  Skill , "Neo Storm Access", as his LP are 1000 or below, allowing him to add a random Cyberse monster from a Data Storm to his Extra Deck. As his opponent activated a Skill, The Gore activates his own Skill "Anti Skill", allowing him to negate the activation of their Skill and draw 2 cards. "Neo Storm Access" is negated. As The Gore drew cards outside of his own Draw Phase, Playmaker activates his set " Draw Discharge " to reveal the drawn cards and if there are monsters among them, the cards are banished while The Gore takes damage equal to their combined ATK. The Gore drew " Dinowrestler Pankratops " (2600/0) and " Dinowrestler Capoeiraptor " (1800/0), meaning he takes 4400 damage. Since his opponent activated a Trap Card while he controls a "Dinowrestler" Link Monster, The Gore activates his set " Dino Sense ", negating and banishing "Draw Discharge" as well as inflicing 300 damage to Playmaker for every monster he controls (Playmaker: 1000 → 100 LP). As his LP are 100 or below and he did not obtain a card with the effect of "Neo Storm Access", Playmaker activates the additional effect of "Neo Storm Access", allowing him to add a random Cyberse monster from a Data Storm to his Extra Deck and draw a card. Playmaker obtains " Firewall eXceed Dragon ". adds it to his Extra Deck and draws " Firewall Guardian ". Playmaker Normal Summons "Firewall Guardian" (100/2000). Playmaker uses "Firewall Guardian" and "Linkuriboh" to Link Summon " Clock Lizard " (1200/LINK-2/↙↓) to the Extra Monster Zone. As it was used as material for a Link Summon, Playmaker Special Summons "Firewall Guardian" from the GY in Defense Position via its own effect. As there is a Field Spell Card in play, Playmaker Special Summons "Grid Sweeper" (100/2000) from his hand in Attack Position via its own effect. 
 Playmaker  overlays  his 2 Level 4 monsters to  Xyz Summon  "Firewall eXceed Dragon" (2500/2000) to the zone the bottom left arrow of "Clock Lizard" points to. Playmaker activates the effect of "eXceed Dragon", detaching 2  Overlay Units  to Special Summon a Link 4 Cyberse from his GY so it points to "eXceed Dragon". Playmaker Special Summons "Firewall Dragon" from his GY to the zone the bottom arrow of "Clock Lizard" points to, and so its left arrow points to "eXceed Dragon". The effect of "eXceed Dragon" makes it gain ATK equal to the combined Link Rating of the Link Monsters that are linked to it x 500 ("eXceed Dragon": 2500 → 5500 ATK). Playmaker activates the effect of "Firewall Dragon" while targeting "King T Wrextle", but The Gore activates the effect of "Dino Domain", returning "Valeonyx" to his hand to make his monsters unaffected by the effects of Playmaker's monsters on the field until the End Phase. Playmaker activates the effect of "Grid Sweeper" in his GY, banishing itself and a Link Monster Playmaker controls to destroy a card his opponent controls. Playmaker banishes "Clock Lizard" and destroys "World Dino Wrestling". 
 At the start of Playmaker's Battle Phase, The Gore activates the effect of "King T Wrextle", targeting "Firewall Dragon". "Firewall Dragon" attacks "King T Wrextle". As Playmaker declared an attack with a Link Monster against another Link Monster, Playmaker activates the effect of "Firewall Guardian" in his GY to negate the attack, make the ATK of "King T Wrextle" 0 and make it unaffected by all monster effects except its own until the End Phase ("King T Wrextle": 4200 → 0 ATK). "eXceed Dragon" attacks and destroys "King T Wrextle" (The Gore: 4000 → 0 LP).
