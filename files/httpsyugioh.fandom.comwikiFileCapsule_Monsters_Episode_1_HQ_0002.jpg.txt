 Biography 
 He is a direct descendant of  Alexander the Great  like  Atem ,  Seto , and  Bandit King Bakura  who they were actually direct ancestors of their modern-day counterparts. He was working with Dr.  Solomon Muto  in India exploring a mysterious pyramid. They entered it and only Brisbane got out, Dr. Muto apparently disappeared into thin air. Later, when Yugi and friends came, he led them to the chamber in the pyramid where Dr. Muto disappeared. It turns out that when professor Brisbane entered, he got possessed by the  dark side of Alexander the Great  and used Yugi and his friends to unleash the "ultimate power."  Later, when the dark side of Alexander got destroyed by  Yami Yugi  and his friends, Brisbane was free, and Solomon explained what happened along the way home.
