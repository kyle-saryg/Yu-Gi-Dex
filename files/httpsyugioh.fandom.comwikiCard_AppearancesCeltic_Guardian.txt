 Duelist Kingdom 
 In  episode 2 ,  Yami Yugi  uses this card during his Duel against  Maximillion Pegasus . He summons this card in Attack Position, intending to use this card to attack " Illusionist Faceless Mage ". Pegasus then uses " Eye of Illusion " to have Yugi's " Dark Magician " (which Pegasus took control of via "Eye of Illusion") attack and destroy this card.
 In the same episode, this card is also shown on  Solomon Muto 's poster while he's talking to his grandson. [1] 
 In  episode 10 , Yami Yugi uses this card during his Duel against  Ghost Kaiba . He summons this card in Attack Position. Yugi uses this card to attack and destroy " Grappler ". This card is on the field until the Duel is over. 
 In  episode 14 , Yami Yugi uses this card during his Duel against  PaniK . He summons this card in Defense Position. PaniK's " Barox " attacks and destroys this card. 
 In  episode 16 , this card is shown in a flashback  Bakura Ryou  has when he makes note of the  Millennium Ring  pointing at Pegasus's castle as something similar when he first started attending Yugi Muto's school. Joey Wheeler is shown using this card in his duel against Yugi. What happens next is unknown as the flashback then shifted to Bakura who then noticed that the Millennium Ring is pointing to Yugi's  Millennium Puzzle . 
 In  episode 19 , Yami Yugi uses this card during his Tag Duel with  Joey Wheeler  against the  Paradox Brothers . He summons this card in Attack Position. Yugi moves this card 4 spaces into  the maze . The brothers' " Wall Shadow " then immediately attacks this card but Joey activates " Kunai with Chain " to equip onto Joey's " Axe Raider " and raise the ATK of both "Axe Raider" and this card by 500. This card then destroys "Wall Shadow". On Para's End Phase, this card's power boost from "Kunai with Chain" wears off, returning this card's ATK to original value. In  the next episode , Yugi has this card together with "Dark Magician", "Axe Raider" and " Flame Swordsman " but the brothers cut Yugi and Joey's Monster Cards off from each other with " Magical Labyrinth ". Later, Dox's " Dungeon Worm " (whose ATK is 2200 due to " Invigoration ") attacks and destroys this card. 
 In  episode 24 , Yami Yugi uses this card during his Duel against  Seto Kaiba . He summons this card in Attack Position. Yami Yugi uses this card to attack and destroy " Blue-Eyes Ultimate Dragon " (which had 900 ATK due to being weakened three times by the combo of " Mammoth Graveyard ", " Living Arrow " and " Polymerization ") but only slices off one of three heads (because "Blue-Eyes Ultimate Dragon" is a fusion of three monsters and each head had its own amount of ATK). Seto couldn't bear to lose the only chance at saving  Mokuba Kaiba  while Yami Yugi wishes to save both his grandfather and Mokuba so Seto then moved to the edge and threatened to jump off if this card's attack is successful (in the original Japanese version; the English dub has this card's attack's shockwave potentially throwing Seto off the ledge). Seto then activates " Monster Reborn " to revive  the head  that this card cut off and now being 100% clean. Yami Yugi attempts to attack another weakened head of "Blue-Eyes Ultimate Dragon" with this card as he's unwilling to lose the Duel but  Yugi Muto  hampers this card's attack at the last moment as he could not bear to see Kaiba fall to his death. The only healthy head of "Blue-Eyes Ultimate Dragon" then attacks and destroys this card, defeating Yugi. 
 In  episode 25 , this card appears in a flashback Yugi Muto has when he remembers Yami Yugi nearly making his winning move against Seto Kaiba despite that he and Yugi knew full well that Kaiba will fall off the ledge if this card's attack was successful. This card's attack was stopped by Yugi at the last moment because he couldn't bear to see Kaiba fall to his death, leading to Yugi being defeated. Yugi notes Yami Yugi would have killed Kaiba if he didn't stop him and there was no other choice. Yugi wonders if he would ever duel again since he could not control Yami Yugi at that point and it may happen again.
