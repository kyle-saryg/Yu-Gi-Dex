 Rayne  announces that she's going to "graduate" from the student council and the Sogetsu Style!  Gavin  is bewildered, but he agrees to let her "graduate" on one condition: she must beat him in a  Duel . Rayne has always been respectful toward Gavin, but during their Duel, she is a lot more aggressive to him than usual, and provokes him at every turn. And it seems that her "Rayne Eyes" aren't the only reason she's acting like this...
