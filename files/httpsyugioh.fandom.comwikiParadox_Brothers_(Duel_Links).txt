 Biography 
 After the player redeems their final unclaimed reward for the Paradox Brothers' Character Unlock Missions, they will encounter the Paradox Brothers again. They tell the player that they are guardians, and have found something that they want to defend, the title of Duel World King. They state that they intend to share the title.
 After being unlocked, they appear again, and Dox alerts his brother that their Deck is missing the three elemental gods, meaning that they cannot Summon " Gate Guardian ". Para then curses  Kaiba , alleging that Kaiba sabotaged them by not programming those cards into their Deck. Para then defiantly proclaims that they will Summon "Gate Guardian" anyway, using their  skill .
 
 Description 
 Eliminators under Pegasus's employ, many Duelists did the Paradox Brothers destroy. Using their expert tag skills, they did their best to bludgeon Joey and Yugi in Duelist Kingdom's underground dungeon. They combined the three elemental gods 「 Sanga of the Thunder 」, 「 Kazejin 」 and 「 Suijin 」 to form their ace monster 「 Gate Guardian 」.

 Trivia 
 During the  Tag Duel Tournament , The Paradox Brother's respective card-specifc dialogue are switched with one another. 
 The Paradox Brothers are the only Legendary Duelists who do not have character-specific dialogue. 
 The Paradox Brothers,  Dark Signer Kalin Kessler , and  Kalin Kessler  are the characters who possess a  Skill  that allows them to begin a Duel with Monster Cards on the field, albeit at a significant cost. 
 Yugi Muto (DM) ,  Bandit Keith , The Paradox Brothers,  Seto Kaiba (DSOD) ,  Yugi Muto (DSOD) ,  Joey Wheeler (DSOD) ,  Jaden Yuki ,  Jesse Anderson ,  Alexis Rhodes ,  Yubel ,  Syrus Truesdale ,  Jaden/Yubel ,  Yusei Fudo ,  Luna ,  Carly Carmine ,  Antinomy , and  Yuma and Astral  are the characters with the most cards that feature a cut-in frame of their face(s). 
 The Paradox Brothers,  Lumis and Umbra , and Yuma and Astral are the only characters that consist of 2 Duelists as a playable set.
 In addition, The Paradox Brothers and Lumis and Umbra are the only characters whose respective ace cards, " Masked Beast Des Gardius " and " Gate Guardian ", are not of UR rarity. The former being SR, and the latter being R.
 Ironically both ace cards can not be obtained as a drop reward from Dueling the said characters. Instead, "Masked Beast Des Gardius" is obtained as a drop reward from  Yami Marik , whereas "Gate Guardian" is obtained from the card trader, and " Number 39: Utopia " is obtained from the card pack. 
 The Paradox Brothers,  Arkana , Lumis and Umbra,  Aigami ,  Sera ,  Prana , Jesse Anderson, Alexis Rhodes,  Dr. Vellian Crowler ,  Bastion Misawa ,  Tyranno Hassleberry ,  Sartorius Kumar ,  Blair Flannigan , Yusei Fudo, Dark Signer Kalin Kessler, Kalin Kessler, and  Reginald Kastle  are the Legendary Duelists who have dialogue for cards that are non-existent, unreleased, anime-exclusive, or video game-exclusive. It is uncertain as to why these cards were found in the voice files, or if these said cards will be released in the future.
 The Paradox Brothers dialogue for such cards include: " Dark Guardian ", " Defense Wall ", " Dark Element ", " Gate Guardian Ritual ", " Labyrinth of Kline ", 
 The Legendary Duelists who have the longest dialogue for the specific cards that feature a cut-in frame of the said character(s) are:
 Seto Kaiba (DM)  -  Obelisk the Tormentor 
 Yami Marik -  The Winged Dragon of Ra 
 Odion  -  Mystical Beast of Serket , The Winged Dragon of Ra 
 The Paradox Brothers - Gate Guardian 
 Yubel -  Yubel - The Ultimate Nightmare 
 Sartorius Kumar -  Arcana Force EX - The Light Ruler ,  Arcana Force XXI - The World 
 Dark Signer Carly Carmine  -  Earthbound Immortal Aslla piscu
