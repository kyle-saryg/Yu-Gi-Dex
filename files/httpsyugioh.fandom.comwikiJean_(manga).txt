 Biography 
 Jean was present at the D1 Grand Prix opening ceremonies where he watched  Rex Goodwin 's introduction to the tournament. [2] 
 Although Jean's  Duels  weren't shown, he made it to the tournament finals. On the cruise to  Saiko Island , he and Andre commented on Crow's argument with Leo, suggesting Crow isn't very mature. They do however note that he is a powerful contender as he easily defeated  Bolt Tanner  with a  One Turn Kill . When  Lazar  informs the finalists of the  Duel Zodiacs  and  Star Tickets , Crow attempted to work out how many possible finalists there could be, which Jean quickly works out for him. He then bids farewell to Andre, telling him that he'll see him in the finals. [1] 
 During the second stage, Jean is shown to have obtained the Level 1  Star Ticket  (an omake from the tankōbon  volume 5  revealed that he defeated  Kodou Kinomiya  to obtain it). He later Duels  Yusei Fudo  and is defeated. He would give Yusei his Level 1 Star Ticket, but Yusei let him keep it. Jean and Andre's plan was to Jean obtain the Level 1 and 2 tickets while Andre obtained the Level 10 and 11 ones, so that both could advance to the finals. [3]
