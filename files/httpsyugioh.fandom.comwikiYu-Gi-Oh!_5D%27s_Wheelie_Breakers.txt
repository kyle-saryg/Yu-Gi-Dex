 Yu-Gi-Oh! 5D's Wheelie Breakers  is a  Yu-Gi-Oh! 5D's  game for the Nintendo Wii, it is a mix of racing and dueling with cards used as "power-ups", very similar to the  Mario Kart  series. Characters who don't have  D-Wheels  in the anime at the time are given exclusive ones for this game (Such as  Leo ,  Akiza Izinski ,  Luna , and  Mr. Armstrong ). Some card effects have been changed in the game to be more suitable for the style of the game.

 Story 
 The story mode takes the  player , guided by Rally, through many head-to-head duels, leading up to the Fortune Cup and a duel with Yusei. Duels with Turbo Duelists such as Trudge, Greiger,and Hunter Pace are done in the real world, while those who don't use Duel Runners, such as Luna, Leo, and Akiza, duel using virtual simulators. Between levels, it is shown that Goodwin and Lazar are conspiring to use you for a special mission.
 
 Gameplay 
         screenshot.     
 The game is more akin to a racing game than Duel Monsters. Players can use monsters to defend themselves and attack opponents, magic cards that power up the player, and trap cards that can defend against player attacks. Monsters can attack if the player has enough Speed Counters that accumulate with racing, and more powerful monsters will require more Speed Counters to attack. Players each have 4000  Life Points , though a player does not lose if he/she reaches zero, they just spin out. This game will also offer a 7 opponent runner mode in which cards will change their effects to power that can help or trap players, just like " Level Down!?  that will "decrease the Top Speed of a player in a higher place than its owner for a limited" moment. In this mode, cards will be power-ups just like in Mario Kart Series.

 Trivia 
 In the Instruction Booklet, Akiza's surname is spelled "Izinsky" instead of "Izinski". 
 In the English version of the game, only the MC has a speaking role during races.  In the Japanese version all characters (except for the player) speak during races. 
 The Life point counter, when shown, is the one used in the Japanese version of the anime. 
 The artwork for Akiza remains largely unedited in the game and instruction book. 
 This game was released on the same day as  Yu-Gi-Oh! 5D's World Championship 2009: Stardust Accelerator .
