 This card's main function is to aid cards that  excavate from your Deck . It is especially useful for effects that require calling the top card of your Deck (" Archfiend's Oath ", " Alsei, the Sylvan High Protector ", " Reversal Quiz " or " The True Name "). 
 Use this card, then follow up with any arbitrary  draw effect  to effectively recover any card in your Graveyard.
 If you discarded " Flowerbot " to activate this card, you essentially recover a card in your Graveyard while putting another in your hand back in your Deck. 
 If the card to be recovered is a monster, then " Monster Reincarnation " is better in terms of card economy. 
 You can return to the top of your Deck the same card you discarded, making this card effectively a  Normal Spell Card  version of " Plaguespreader Zombie " and similar cards. 
 Use this card to place " Super Rejuvenation " on top of your Deck, while discarding a  Dragon  monster. When you draw it again during your End Phase, activate it again to draw twice the number of cards.
