The pieces in this game have been used for the design of several  Archfiends ;
 
 Pawn  -  Vilepawn Archfiend 
 Knight  -  Shadowknight Archfiend 
 Bishop  -  Darkbishop Archfiend 
 Rook  -  Desrook Archfiend 
 Queen  - Both  Infernalqueen Archfiend  and  Imprisoned Queen Archfiend 
 King  -  Terrorking Archfiend  and  Masterking Archfiend 
 Also, the support card " Checkmate " is named after the winning move in chess.
 
 Appearances in Yu-Gi-Oh! 
 In the  Yu-Gi-Oh!  universe,  Seto  and  Mokuba  often played chess at their  orphanage .  Gozaburo Kaiba  was a chess grandmaster. Seto challenged him to a game of chess, where if Seto won, Gozaburo would have to adopt Seto and Mokuba. In the manga, Seto won the game by cheating. [1]  In the anime, Seto won because he had studied Gozaburo's strategies. [2] 
 In the Japanese anime when Kaiba was sent to an illusion of a war-struck city,  Aaron  offered to play a game of chess by etching the board in soil and using empty weapon cartridges as pieces. However they were interrupted as the area was bombed. [3] 
 In  Yu-Gi-Oh! R ,  Reiko Kitamori  uses chess themed " Puppet " monsters. A number of the " Archfiend " series are also based on chess pieces. Both sets of cards have support cards based on different chess moves and positions.
 The game  Capsule Monster Chess  is partly based on chess.
