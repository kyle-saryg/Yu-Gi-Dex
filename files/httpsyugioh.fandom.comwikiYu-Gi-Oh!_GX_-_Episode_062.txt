 Summary 
 Jaden Yuki  is stranded in a boat when a comet hits. Afterwards, he is transported into  Neo Space , a  Duel Monsters Spirit World  that represents and protects the delicate balance between Light and Darkness. Within this Limbo, Jaden ends up on  Io , where he is greeted by a  dolphin-like creature , who explains that  the "Gentle Darkness"  is in danger of being obliterated by a mysterious " Dark Light ", and only Jaden is able to fight off this entity and save the universe.
 Just then, an unusual  Duel Robot  sent by this  "Dark Light"  arrives, and Jaden must defeat it in a Duel, using cards salvaged from a satellite. He's shocked when he can see the cards he's holding, and even more shocked when he discovers that the cards were contained within a  KaibaCorp  satellite, which was carrying cards he'd designed for a global contest held by  Seto Kaiba  a few years ago, and Jaden figures that he was the winner.
 After winning the Duel, Jaden rediscovers his love for Dueling and regains his resolve, and then sets out to return to  Duel Academy  and stop this mysterious "Light", however while Jaden finds himself back on  Duel Academy , he finds that he is in a forest that is far from where the school building actually is.
 
 Featured Duel: Jaden Yuki vs. Alien of Light 
 Turn 1: Jaden 
Jaden draws " Chrysalis Dolphin ", while his hand contains " Polymerization ", " Monster Reincarnation ", two copies of " Fusion Sage ", and  De-Fusion ". Jaden then Normal Summons "Chrysalis Dolphin" (400/600) in  Defense Position .
 Turn 2: The Alien of Light 
Alien of Light draws. It then  sends  two cards from its  hand  to the  Graveyard  in order to  Special Summon  " Candelato, the Beast of Light " (0/0) in  Attack Position . Due to the effect of "Candelato", it gains 1000 ATK for each card in the Alien's hand. The Alien is currently holding three cards ("Candelato, the Beast of Light": 0 → 3000/0). Due to the first effect of "Candelato", it cannot attack in the same turn that it is summoned.
 Turn 3: Jaden 
Jaden draws " Dandylion " and subsequently Normal Summons it (300/300) in Defense Position.
 Turn 4: The Alien of Light 
Because of "Candelato's" final effect, the Alien must skip its  Draw Phase . "Candelato" attacks and  destroys  "Dandylion". Since "Dandylion" was sent to the Graveyard, its effect activates, allowing Jaden to Special Summon two " Fluff Tokens " (0/0) in Defense Position.
 Turn 5: Jaden 
Jaden draws " Pot of Greed " and subsequently activates it to  draw  two cards ("Elemental Hero Neos" and "Contact"). Jaden then activates " Contact " to send "Chrysalis Dolphin" to the Graveyard and Special Summon " Neo-Spacian Aqua Dolphin " (600/800) in Attack Position. Jaden then Tributes his two "Fluff Tokens" in order to  Tribute Summon  " Elemental Hero Neos " (2500/2000) in Attack Position.
 Jaden then activates the effect of "Neo-Spacian Aqua Dolphin" to  discard  " Fusion Sage ", look at Alien's hand and select a monster in it. If the ATK of that monster is weaker than the ATK of a monster Jaden controls, that card is destroyed, and the Alien will take 500  damage ; otherwise, Jaden will take 500 damage. Jaden chooses the " Different Dimension Dragon " (1200/1500) in the Alien's hand. The latter monster is destroyed (Alien of Light 4000 → 3500) ("Candelato, the Beast of Light": 3000 → 2000/0). 
 Jaden then activates the effect of "Neo-Spacian Aqua Dolphin" again by discarding another copy of "Fusion Sage". Jaden then selects the " D.D. Crazy Beast " (1400/1400) in the Alien's hand. The latter monster is destroyed (Alien of Light 3500 → 3000) [Notes 1]  ("Candelato, the Beast of Light": 2000 → 1000/0). 
 Jaden then activates the effect of "Neo-Spacian Aqua Dolphin" a third time by discarding " Polymerization ". Jaden then selects the " D.D. Scout Plane " (800/1200) in the Alien's hand. The latter monster is destroyed (Alien of Light 3000 → 2500) [Notes 1]  ("Candelato, the Beast of Light": 1000 → 0/0). "Neos" attacks and destroys "Candelato" (Alien of Light 2500 → 0).
 
 Differences in adaptations 
 In the Japanese dub, Neo Spacian Aqua Dolphin is shown to be naked by displaying rear nudity in several scenes.  The English dub removed the nudity and had Jaden say that Aqua Dolphin was wearing spandex.
