 " Despia " (デスピア  Desupia ) is an  archetype  of  DARK   Fairy   Main Deck   monsters  and  LIGHT   Fiend   Extra Deck  monsters which debuted in  Dawn of Majesty .
 
 Etymology 
 The name "Despia" is likely a  portmanteau  of the words " Despair " and " thespian " (also related to  Thespiae ).
 Most of the "Despia" cards consist of corrupted versions of the " Dogmatika " monsters. This may have been started with the events depicted in the artwork of " Dogmatikalamity ", where " Dogmatika Maximus " opens a portal to the Hole.
