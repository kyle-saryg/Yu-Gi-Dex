 Summary 
 Dark Bakura  grins nastily, declaring his turn, pointing out that  Yugi  knows what that means; another letter appears on the " Ouija Board ." " Dark Necrofear " moves the symbol to the letter "E" of "DEATH." As the ghostly letter appears in the air, Dark Bakura points out that that's right, when all five letters of the word "DEATH" appear, the declaration of death will be complete, and the Ouija Board never lies. Dark Yugi thinks that, so this is Bakura's Occult strategy. Even if Dark Yugi has  Life Points  left, when "DEATH" is spelled out, the game will end. He wonders if there's any way to escape this spell. Laughing, Dark Bakura tells him to think all he wants; he only has three turns left. The score stands with Bakura on 2450 Life Points, and Dark Yugi on 2000. Dark Yugi controls his " Dark Magician Girl ," boosted by the " Magic Formula ," " Kuriboh ," and " Gamma the Magnet Warrior ." Dark Bakura, meanwhile, only controls his  Attack Position  " Earthbound Spirit ." 
 Dark Bakura wonders where he was, thinking that if Yugi thinks that things can't get any worse, he's got a real surprise for him. He plays a card face-down and he ends his turn. Though he doesn't know why he bothers...when the time come, Yugi will die without Dark Bakura even lifting a finger. Dark Yugi growls as Dark Bakura reminds him that it's his turn. Down the bottom,  Jonouchi  tells  Yugi  not to let Bakura scare him. But he curses, pointing out that Bakura has him cornered. Yugi's got to get rid of that Ouija Board somehow.  Anzu  reminds him that one of Yugi's monsters in possessed by the spirit of Bakura's monster. If he picks the wrong monster to attack with, he'll be the one who gets hurt, and it'll heal Bakura too. Jonouchi points out that if he doesn't do something, he'll lose in three turns.  Honda  reminds them that this is Yugi they're talking about, he's got to have some kind of plan. But Dark Bakura thinks that there's no way out; his Occult combo is unbeatable. Dark Yugi declares his turn. 
 Dark Bakura chuckles, thinking that now the marionette's spirit will possess one of Yugi's monsters. This time it chooses the "Dark Magician Girl," and Dark Bakura thinks that only he can see who the lucky monster is. Dark Yugi is wondering which monster that Bakura possessed, knowing that it isn't "Kuriboh," which isn't an offensive monster, so it's either "Gamma" or "Dark Magician Girl." He knows that Bakura's  Permanent Spell Card , " The Dark Door " will only let him attack once, and wonders if he should just pass, but immediately decides against it, as he only has a few turns left. He yells that if he hesitates now, there's no way he can win. Thinking that this is a gamble, he attacks with his "Magnet Warrior." Dark Bakura immediately activates his  Trap Card , " Dark Spirit of the Silent ." It possesses a monster in attack mode, silences it, and forces another monster to takes its place. The Dark Sprit possesses "Gamma," stopping it dead, and Dark Yugi realizes that his attack command will be carried out by "Dark Magician Girl." The unwilling  Spellcaster  is dragged forwards, and Dark Bakura explains that the "Magician Girl" is possessed by the spirit of the marionette, so she'll attack Yugi. He declares " Spirit Burn ," and the spirit emerges from "Dark Magician Girl" to attack Dark Yugi, reducing him to 750 Life Points. Dark Bakura reminds him that for each point of damage Yugi takes, Bakura's own injuries heal. His Life Points rise to 3700. Anzu cries out Yugi's name, and Jonouchi curses inwardly, thinking that Bakura's Occult combo is perfect, there's no way to beat it. 
 Smiling, Dark Bakura points out that now the Ouija Board will point to the third letter, the letter "A" of "DEATH." Dark Yugi realizes that he only has two turns left. Even  Kaiba  is shocked at such a terrifying combo, and he wonders just who this  Ryo Bakura  is. He thinks that Yugi's ability to fight has already been totally crippled, and he wonders if he'll have to waste his remaining turns and simply wait for "DEATH" to come. Then he reprimands himself, thinking that Yugi can turn this situation around, his fighting spirit can't be broken, not by this. Sark Bakura tells Yugi that he's finished, claiming that his Occult Deck has no weaknesses. Jonouchi begs Yugi not to lose; he's got to fight him in the finals. Dark Yugi urges himself to think, there must be something that he can do. The problem is that spirit, Bakura's invisible spirit that possesses his monsters. That  Permanent Trap Card  forces him to attack, making him lose Life Points every time. Unless he destroys the Ghost of "Dark Necrofear's" marionette, along with "Dark Spirit of the Silent," there's no way he can win. then he looks at his hand, and he thinks that there  is  a way. Setting two face-down cards, he ends his turn. 
 Dark Bakura snickers, commenting that Yugi still fights on, even faced with the certainty of death. Dark Yugi refuses to die. No matter what happens during a Duel, he will always survive that one turn, and the next turn always brings possibilities. Bakura tells Dark Yugi not to make him laugh, there are no "new possibilities." He declares his turn, and comments that Dark Yugi is still standing on the brink of death. Two more turns, Bakura reminds him. Let's see his face distort from fear. He ends his turn. Dark Yugi draws. He chuckles, telling Bakura to get ready; in his next two turn, he will crush Bakura's Occult combo. Bakura wonders how, and Anzu and Jonouchi cheer his name, while Honda tells him to show them how it's done. Kaiba laughs himself. Dark Yugi reminds Bakura of the new possibilities, one for each card. A Duelist has as many possibilities as they have cards. He plays a card, declaring that this is one of them. The  Spell Card , " Monster Recovery ." He returns his monsters to his hand, and comments that now, without any bodies to possess, Bakura's spirit should be haunting his field. He tells him to watch closely, shuffling his hand with his Deck and drawing five new cards. Then he Summons a monster in attack mode - "Kuriboh." Dark Bakura is shocked to see the monster in attack mode, and Dark Yugi points out that there's only one monster Bakura's marionette can possess. The marionette spirit possess "Kuriboh," and Dark Yugi reminds Dark Bakura that since "Kuriboh" is in attack mode, it activates the other trap as well, forcing "Dark Spirit of the Silent" to possess "Kuriboh." And last but not least, when Dark Yugi Summoned "Kuriboh," he activated his Trap Card, "Chain Destruction." Dark Bakura thinks in horror that if "Kuriboh" dies, then the spirits die with him, and the little  Fiend  explodes. Dark Yugi asks his monster to forgive him. Dark Bakura is furious that Dark Yugi destroyed his monsters, but points out that the Ouija Board has pointed to the fourth letter, as the letter "T" appears. Yugi only has one turn left. 
 But Dark Yugi claims that one turn is all he needs to win this game.

 Production history 
 The Battle Retold!  is the 147th chapter of  Yu-Gi-Oh! Duelist . In the Japanese manga it is the 206th chapter of  Yu-Gi-Oh! . It was first printed in Japanese in the  V Jump  magazine. It was reprinted in volume 24 of the Japanese graphic novels and  volume 17  of the Yu-Gi-Oh! Duelist graphic novels in English.
 
 Anime adaption 
 This Chapter was redone in the end of  episode 83  of the  Yu-Gi-Oh! second series anime . A number of changes were made including:
 
 During the Duel,  Bakura  was still wearing his jacket from the Dungeon Dice Monsters chapters. 
 As always, Dark Magician Girl's bust size is slightly reduced and in the English dub, her pentagram replaced by a red jewel. 
 In the manga,  Bakura  didn't play  Dark Sanctuary , all the effects of Dark Sanctuary were in fact the effects of  Dark Necrofear  which activated when it was sent to the  Graveyard . 
 In the manga, when  Bakura  played  Destiny Board  a hologram of  Dark Necrofear  with the Ouija Board appeared above  Bakura , it wrote the letters of the word  DEATH  at each end of Yugi's turns. 
 In the manga, Bakura wasn't forced to  Sacrifice  monsters to keep the dark spirit, so he didn't sacrifice  Earthbound Spirit  and it remains in the duel until he Tributes it for " The Earl of Demise ". 
 In the anime,  Yugi  had played  Big Shield Gardna  before attacking with  Gamma . 
 In the anime,  Bakura  had summoned  Sangan  and then  Sacrificed  it to keep  Dark Sanctuary  instead of only setting a face-down card and ending his turn. 
 In the anime,  Bakura  had summoned  Souls of the Forgotten  and then  Sacrificed  it to keep  Dark Sanctuary  instead of skip his turn. 
 The strategy  Yugi  used to defeat the dark spirit are completely different in anime, he first activates  Collected Power  to force the spirit to possess  Kuriboh  then he activates  Exile of the Wicked  to destroy  Kuriboh  along with the spirit.
