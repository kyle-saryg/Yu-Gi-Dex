 Biography 
 Shortly after Okita and  Liquid  join the Arcadia Movement, the  player  is sent to their room. Okita introduces himself and faces the player in a friendly Duel.
 Okita, Liquid and the player are sent to infiltrate the  Fortune Cup  and assist  Akiza Izinski . Not being participants in the tournament, the three of them are not allowed into the stadium through the front gate, but manage to sneak inside.
 Okita watches Akiza's Duel with  Yusei Fudo  and reports back to the player and Liquid that she lost.
 Later, when the player tries to save Leo from his prison, Okita and Liquid stand guard in the hallways. The player sneaks pass them but were caught by Sayer and he ordered Okita and Liquid to Tag Duel with the player and Luna. After they were defeated, the brainwashing wears off and Okita and Liquid created a plan with the player to escape the building. Okita and Liquid reported to Sayer the player was defeated afterward although the plan quickly backfired when Sayer caught the player right in the flesh. Okita and Liquid presumably escaped the building with the player and the rest who escaped.
 After the story concludes the player can assist him and Liquid in finding a new home, where he is a surprisingly big jerk towards Liquid.
