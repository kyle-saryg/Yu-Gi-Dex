Chinese  cards are printed in  Chinese languages . They can be printed in either  Standard Chinese  or  Yue Chinese , as they are manufactured in Hong Kong and distributed in some part of Asia.
 There are also Chinese promotional cards that were printed in Japan, including " Blue-Eyes White Dragon " and " Dark Magician ". Despite being printed in Chinese, the cards used the Japanese set of Han characters, known as Kanji.
 Chinese cards use the Japanese card formatting on Chinese card names and texts; most terms are localized, though a few of them are transcribed forms of Western loanwords. However, cards are still printed with the Japanese copyright text on the bottom-right corner, and the Japanese back. Chinese cards use Japanese card artworks.
