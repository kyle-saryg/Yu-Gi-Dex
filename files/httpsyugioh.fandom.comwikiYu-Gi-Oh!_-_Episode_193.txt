 Featured Duels 
 Featured Duel #1: Rebecca Hawkins vs. Leon Wilson - Part 2 
 Duel continues from previous episode. 
 Rebecca has 1300 Life Points remaining and controls no cards.
 Leon has 1700 Life Points remaining and controls " Cinderella " (1300/600) in Attack Position, " Pumpkin Carriage " (0/300) in Defense Position,
" Curse of Thorns ", " Glass Slippers ".
 Turn 9: Rebecca Hawkins 
 Rebecca   draws  " Pot of Greed " and subsequently  activates  it to draw two cards. She then  Normal Summons  " Witch of the Black Forest " (1100/1200) in  Attack Position . "Witch of the Black Forest"  attacks  and  destroys  "Pumpkin Carriage".
 Turn 10: Leon Wilson 
 Leon  draws. "Cinderella" attacks and destroys "Witch of the Black Forest" (Rebecca 1300 → 1100). Since "Witch of the Black Forest" was destroyed and sent from the  field  to the  Graveyard , its effect activates, allowing Rebecca to add "Ruby Dragon" from her  Deck  to her  hand . Leon then Normal Summons " Tom Thumb " (100/100) in  Defense Position  and  Sets  a card.
 Turn 11: Rebecca Hawkins 
Rebecca draws. She Normal Summons " Ruby Dragon " (1600/1200) in  Attack Position . She then activates " Dragon's Fire " and chooses to activate its second effect to destroy "Cinderella" [Notes 1] . "Ruby Dragon" attacks "Tom Thumb", but Leon activates his  face-down  " Negate Attack " to negate the attack and end the  Battle Phase . [Notes 2]  Rebecca  Sets  two cards.
 Turn 12: Leon Wilson 
Leon draws. He then activates " Giant's Training " to  Tribute  "Tom Thumb" and  Special Summon  " Globerman " (2600/2000) from his  Deck  in  Attack Position . "Globerman" attacks and destroys "Ruby Dragon" (Rebecca 1100 → 100). 
 Rebecca then activates her  face-down  " Rope of Life " to discard her entire  hand  (Rebecca discards nothing as she has no cards in her hand) and revive "Ruby Dragon" in Attack Position with 800 more  ATK  (1600 → 2400/1200).
 Rebecca then activates her  face-down  " Adamantine Sword Revival " to  Tribute  "Ruby Dragon" and  Special Summon  " Diamond Head Dragon " (?/2800) from her  Deck  in  Attack Position . Due to the effect of "Diamond Head Dragon", its  ATK  becomes equal to the ATK of "Ruby Dragon" when it was Tributed plus 1000 (" Diamond Head Dragon ": ? → 3400/2800).
 Turn 13: Rebecca Hawkins 
Rebecca draws " Dragon's Rage ". "Diamond Head Dragon" attacks and destroys "Globerman" (Leon 1700 → 900). Rebecca then Sets a card ("Dragon's Rage"). Rebecca intends for Leon to  Summon  a monster whose  ATK / DEF  is not 2500 or higher. This will allow Rebecca to activate "Dragon's Rage" on her next  turn  which will grant "Diamond Head Dragon" the ability to inflict  piercing  damage and allow her to win the  Duel .
 Turn 14: Leon Wilson 
Leon draws " Gold Moon Coin " and subsequently activates it to give Rebecca his entire hand (however, he gives Rebecca only one card - " Spinning Wheel Spindle " and keeps the extra "Glife the Phantom Bird" from earlier) and draw the same number of cards he just gave (he draws one card: "100-Year Awakening"). Leon then activates " 100-Year Awakening " to send "Curse of Thorns" to the Graveyard and  Special Summon  " Thorn Princess " (400/1200) from his  Deck  in  Attack Position . The effect of "Thorn Princess" activates when it is  Summoned , allowing Leon to take  control  of "Diamond Head Dragon". "Diamond Head Dragon" attacks directly (Rebecca 100 → 0).

 Vivian's Turn 
 Vivian   draws  " Luminous Clouds " and subsequently  activates  it to  Tribute  " Master Kyonshee " and " Kung Fu Nyan Nyan " and  Special Summon  " Dragon Lady " (2500/2100) in  Attack Position . She then activates " Lightning Saber ",  equipping  it to her "Dragon Lady" and increasing its  ATK  by 300 (" Dragon Lady ": 2500 → 2800/2100). 
 "Dragon Lady" attacks and destroys " Dark Magician " ( Yami Yugi  3500 → 3200). Vivian activates the second effect of "Lightning Saber" to halve the  ATK  of "Dragon Lady" ("Dragon Lady": 2800 → 1400/2100) and allow it to attack again this turn. "Dragon Lady" attacks  directly  ( Yami Yugi  3200 → 1800). At the end of the  Battle Phase , the effect of "Lightning Saber" expires (" Dragon Lady ": 1400 → 2800/2100).
 Yami Yugi's Turn 
Yami Yugi draws. He then Normal Summons " Big Shield Gardna " (100/2600) in  Defense Position  and Sets a card.
 Vivian's Turn 
Vivian draws. "Dragon Lady" attacks "Big Shield Gardna", but Yami Yugi activates his  face-down  " Mirror Force " to destroy all  Attack Position   monsters  Vivian  controls , however Vivian activates " Snowfall Sword " to negate the activation of " Mirror Force " and destroy it. "Dragon Lady" then destroys "Big Shield Gardna". 
 Vivian then activates the second effect of "Lightning Saber" ("Dragon Lady": 2800 → 1400/2100) in order to allow "Dragon Lady" to attack again. Before "Dragon Lady" attacks, Vivian activates " Flying Dragon Whirl " to target her "Dragon Lady" and  send  four  Dragon - Type  monsters (" Pitch-Dark Dragon ", " Blackland Fire Dragon ", " Kiryu " and " Sky Dragon ") from her  Deck  to the  Graveyard  in order to increase the  ATK  of "Dragon Lady" by 300 for each Dragon-type monster sent this way (" Dragon Lady ": 1400 → 2600/2100). 
 "Dragon Lady" attacks directly, but Yami Yugi  discards  " Kuriboh " via its own effect to reduce the  Battle damage  to 0. At the end of the  Battle Phase , the effect of "Lightning Saber" expires ("Dragon Lady": 2600 → 4000 /2100). On Vivian's End Phase, the effect of "Flying Dragon Whirl" expires (" Dragon Lady ": 4000 → 2800/2100).
 Yami Yugi's Turn 
Yami Yugi draws " Skilled Dark Magician " and subsequently  Normal Summons  it (1900/1700) in  Attack Position . Each time a  Spell Card  is activated, the effect of "Skilled Dark Magician" will place a  Spell Counter  on itself for a maximum of three. Yami Yugi then activates " Pot of Greed " to draw two cards (Spell Counters of "Skilled Dark Magician": 0 → 1). He then activates " Emblem of Dragon Destroyer " to add " Buster Blader " from his  Graveyard  to his  hand  (Spell Counters of "Skilled Dark Magician": 1 → 2). 
 Yami Yugi then activates " Monster Reincarnation " to return "Dark Magician" from his  Graveyard  to his  Deck [Notes 3]  (Spell Counters of "Skilled Dark Magician": 2 → 3).
 Since there are now three Spell Counters on "Skilled Dark Magician", Yami Yugi activates the second effect of "Skilled Dark Magician" to  Tribute  the latter and  Special Summon  "Dark Magician" from his  Deck  (2500/2100) in  Attack Position . Yami Yugi then activates " Polymerization " to fuse "Dark Magician" with "Buster Blader" and  Fusion Summon  " Dark Paladin " (2900/2400) in  Attack Position . 
 Due to the effect of "Dark Paladin", it gains 500  ATK  for each  Dragon -Type monster on the  field  and in both players'  Graveyards . There are currently no Dragon-type monsters on the field and four in Vivian's Graveyard ("Dark Paladin": 2900 → 4900/2400). "Dark Paladin" attacks and destroys "Dragon Lady" (Vivian 2100 → 0).

 Notes 
 
 ↑   "Dragon's Gunfire" is renamed "Dragon's Fire" in the English dub to censor "gun" from its name. 
 
 ↑  2.0   2.1   "Negate Attack" was played as a  Quick-Play Spell Card  in the Japanese version of this episode. 
 
 ↑   Yami Yugi doesn't seem to shuffle " Dark Magician " into his  Deck , though this is irrelevant after he uses the effect of " Skilled Dark Magician ", which essentially allows him to  Special Summon  the " Dark Magician " from anywhere. 
 
 ↑   This card was shown being restrained by the effect of " Curse of Thorns " 
 
 ↑  5.0   5.1   5.2   5.3   This card is  sent  from her  Deck  to the  Graveyard  via the  effect  of " Flying Dragon Whirl ". 
 
 ↑   This card is  sent  from her  Deck  to the  Graveyard  to activate " Flying Dragon Whirl ", only in the dub. It replaces the " Kiryu " that appeared in the Japanese version.
