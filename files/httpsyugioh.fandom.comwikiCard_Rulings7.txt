 OCG Rulings 
 You can only activate the drawing effect when you have exactly three " 7 " on your field. [1] 
 You can only activate the effect of one " 7 " and draw only 3 cards.  You cannot activate the effects of all three copies of " 7 " and draw 9 cards. [1] 
 When the three " 7 " are sent to the  Graveyard , all three have their recovery effects activate and they form a  Chain . [1] 
 Previously Official Rulings 
   These TCG rulings were issued by  Upper Deck Entertainment  and have since been deemed unofficial by Konami. [2]  They were previously considered official and can still be correct, as long as they follow the official gameplay rules, or unless Konami has issued a ruling that says otherwise. References:  [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] 
 
 If you have 3 " 7 "'s and  destroy  them all, you get 2100  Life Points . 
 If your opponent also has " 7 "'s, they are also destroyed. 
 If you have 3 " 7 "'s and activate their effect, your opponent can chain " Imperial Order " to negate the effect. 
 Each effect of " 7 " that gives you 700  Life Points  goes on a  chain , so if multiple " 7 "'s are sent to the  Graveyard  simultaneously, each effect is 1 step in the  chain . 
 If other cards are also sent to the  Graveyard  at the same time, like " Sangan " or " Black Pendant ", the card controlled by the turn player is Step 1. 
 If your 3rd " 7 " is activated, but destroyed by " Mystical Space Typhoon " in a chain, you can't  activate  its effect, but you still gain 700 Life Points for its  Graveyard  effect.
