 Appearances 
 While searching for his friends, who had been kidnapped by  Marik Ishtar ,  Yami Yugi  was stopped by two Rare Hunters who challenged him to Duels, threatening to have  Joey Wheeler  killed if he refused to accept. As the Rare Hunters tried to decided who would Duel first,  Seto Kaiba  arrived and suggested they make it a Tag Team Duel. He assured Yugi he was doing it because he wanted rid of the Rare Hunters, not because he cared about Yugi's friends. Using " Obelisk the Tormentor ", Kaiba quickly defeated the two Rare Hunters. [2] [3] 
 In the English dub of the anime, when Yami Yugi and Kaiba Dueled  Lumis and Umbra , they claimed to have also been this team. [4]  This implication is not mentioned elsewhere.
