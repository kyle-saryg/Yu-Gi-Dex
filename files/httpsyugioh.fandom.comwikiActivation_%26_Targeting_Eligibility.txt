Many cards and effects can only be  activated  under certain conditions, or can only be used against certain  targets . But because other cards and effects can be  chained  to them, and  resolve  before the original card resolves, those conditions aren't always still correct at the end of the  chain . 
 In general, if a card has specific conditions in order to be activated, those conditions only have to be correct at the time the card is activated. If they are no longer correct when the card resolves, the card's effect still resolves. 
 However, if a card has specific conditions regarding its target, and those conditions are no longer correct at the time the card is activated and when the card resolves, then the card's effect disappears.
 
 Examples of cards with specific conditions for activation, and how those conditions no longer have to be correct at resolution: 
 Example #1:  Player A has two cards in his hand and Player B has six cards in her hand. Player A  activates  " Gamble ." Player B responds by  chaining  two " Mystical Space Typhoons " from her  hand , so she now has four cards in her hand when "Gamble"  resolves . "Gamble" still resolves because its condition only had to be correct at activation. 
 Example #2:  Player A has no cards in his Graveyard and activates " Dimension Distortion ." Player B chains with " Ring of Destruction " to  destroy  one of Player A's  monsters  on the field and send it to the  Graveyard . When " Dimension Distortion " resolves, Player A now has 1 card in his  Graveyard , but " Dimension Distortion " still resolves because its condition only had to be correct at activation. 
 Examples of cards with specific conditions for selection of targets, and how those conditions must still be correct at  resolution : 
 Example #1:  Player A activates " Ring of Destruction ," targeting Player B's " Dark Magician ." Player B  chains  " Book of Moon " to  flip  " Dark Magician "  face-down . When "Ring of Destruction"  resolves , its effect disappears because it must  target  a  face-up   monster  on the field. 
 Example #2:  Player A Summons " Yata-Garasu ." Player B  activates  " Eatgaboon " to destroy it. Player A chains " Rush Recklessly " to increase " Yata-Garasu 's"  ATK  by 700 points. When "Eatgaboon" resolves, its effect disappears because it must target a  monster  with an  ATK  of 500 or less. 
 Example #3:  " Mystic Plasma Zone " is  active . Player A  Summons  " Lord of D. " Player B activates " Trap Hole ." Player A chains " Reverse Trap " to decrease "Lord of D.'s"  ATK  by 500 points combined with "Mystic Plasma Zone." When "Trap Hole" resolves, its effect disappears because it must target a  monster  with an ATK of 1000 or greater. 
 Example #4:  Player A activates " Nobleman of Crossout ", targeting Player B's  face-down   monster . Player B chains " Ceasefire ",  flipping  all  monsters  face-up. When "Nobleman of Crossout" resolves, its effect disappears because it must target a face-down  monster . 
 Example #5:  Player A activates " Nobleman of Extermination ", targeting Player B's face-down card. Player B chains the card, which is " Waboku ." When "Nobleman of Extermination" resolves, its effect disappears because it must target a face-down  Spell  or  Trap Card .
