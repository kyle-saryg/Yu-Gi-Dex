 Biography 
 History 
 Some time before the  World Racing Grand Prix , Dragan went exploring with his father and found " Thor, Lord of the Aesir " in a cave with tree roots under a church. Once he grabbed the card, the cave started to collapse and his father was injured. When leaving the hospital, he is encountered by  Lazar  who offers him a chance to  Duel   Jack Atlas  for the title of Duel King, where he would receive money for his father's injuries. 
 However, he would only receive the money if he lost on purpose and made it look like Jack defeated him easily so he could uphold his name as the king. Dragan almost used a  card that would likely have won him the Duel , but nevertheless accepted defeat so that his father could receive treatment.
 Some time later, Dragan is caught in an avalanche while mountain climbing. Fortunately, he is saved by his  Rune Eye . After this, he is approached by  Halldor  who encourages him to use "Thor" and join him. Dragan accepted and, together with  Broder , they formed  Team Ragnarok .
 
 World Racing Grand Prix 
 Dragan, along with his companions, were on a plane flying towards  New Domino City  for the  WRGP . At the same time, the  Three Pure Nobles  achieved  falsification of history . Dragan, along with the others, noticed that their  Aesirs  had protected them from the wave. Dragan also noticed another "phenomenon" which others had not noticed.
 Later, Dragan and his team appeared publicly to host an exhibition  Duel  against the other teams in the WRGP. He chose to Duel  Jack Atlas . During the Duel, after  Summoning  " Thor " and  attacking  " Red Dragon Archfiend ", the two  monsters  emit a strange wave of energy while battling. Because the force began to destroy the building, the duel was called off.
 After his team meets up with 5D's, Dragan reveals the truth to Jack about their Duel from three years ago. He also states that their score will be settled when they Duel in the semifinals, to which Jack agrees.
 Finally, the day of the WRGP semifinals begin, and Dragan faces Jack in a long-awaited rematch. Strangely, they both get the same  hand  as that of their first Duel, therefore repeating the same moves. However, this time Dragan strategically calls forth "Thor" and pushes Jack to a corner by reducing his  Life Points  dramatically.
 Still, his Aesir proves no match when Jack summons " Red Nova Dragon ". Although Dragan tries to counter the dragon's " Burning Soul " attack, Jack succeeds in making it strong enough to  destroy  "Thor" and defeat Dragan.
 
 Ark Cradle 
 In  episode 147 , he and his teamates have survived. They were last seen cheering on  Yusei  during his Duel against  Z-ONE
