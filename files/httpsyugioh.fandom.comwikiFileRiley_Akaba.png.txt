 Appearance 
       Full body view of Riley.     
Riley is a short tomboy with pale skin, purplish light grey hair, and blue eyes, and she usually has a vacant expression on her face. She dresses simply, wearing a yellow and blue striped shirt, grey cargo pants that appeared to have been rolled up, blue sneakers with red shoe laces with most of the bottom being grey except for the toe vamp and toe cap which are white. The foxing is mostly grey except for 3 vertical blue stripes the bottom being grey except for the toe vamp and toe cap which are white. The foxing is mostly grey except for 3 vertical blue stripes over pale pink socks, and a turquoise hooded sweatshirt, with a black club on her left upper side. She keeps the hood up, despite also wearing a cap. Riley also wears a wide metal collar around her neck.        Riley's true appearance.     
 As revealed during her Duel with  Z-ARC , Riley's hair is actually incredibly long, extending past her waist though this could be due to Ray's possesion. As an infant however, it is short. All of the members of the Akaba family have a slight card suit motif; Riley's is the club/clover, shown by the pin she wears on the left side of her sweatshirt, and her use of the " C/C " archetype.
 
 Personality 
 Riley is incredibly timid and is seen carrying a patchwork teddy bear with her (named "Barry" in the English dub). During the opening day of the tournament, she hid behind the plush toy as the crowd cheered. [2]  Unlike her older brother, Riley doesn't have the confidence to Duel her opponents. However she is considered the treasured student of  LID . It also appears  her mother  strikes fear into her. When she wouldn't Duel  Allie , she looked up at the window and saw her mother, who mouthed a word (audibly told her to not disappoint her in the dub), and she got to Dueling.
 Riley also doesn't appear to handle the pressure of being considered the "Jewel of LID". When her mother bragged that she would beat  Tate , Riley was seen gripping her teddy bear tighter, a fact only Tate noted. [8]  However, Riley looks up to  Declan  as she Duels seriously the moment, he steps in to watch her Duel, and when Tate praised her for being able to master the three summoning methods like her older brother, Riley looked happy. Declan, in return, often congratulates her and tells her to keep winning, showing that he cares. [6] 
 Riley goes into a state of panic when she doesn't know where Declan is. When she,  Sylvio ,  Celina , and  Yuya  first appeared in the  Synchro Dimension , Riley was more concerned about the location of her brother, rather than the upcoming  Sector Security  agents looking to arrest the four. [9]  Despite his best intentions, Yuya also couldn't get Riley to open up at all, since she was afraid of losing Declan. [10] 
 It is later revealed that Riley lacks a sense of self, and she is thus unable to decide anything, essentially leaving her with no identity whatsoever. Henrietta speculates that this was the result of a survival instinct she developed. However, after spending time with Yuya,  Crow Hogan , and  Shinji Weber , Riley's sense of self starts to bud, beginning with interacting with the kids under Crow's care and telling Declan she does not want to Duel Shinji in the  Friendship Cup , even running to Yuya when she thought Declan was mad at her. Advice from  Jack Atlas  later expands this, to the point that Riley not only overcomes her timid nature in order to apologize to Moon Shadow for desiring his loss, but also shows a keen understanding of the Lancers' current situation and passes on advice to Yuya through Moon Shadow. Riley also gains the desire to assist her brother, Moon Shadow, and Yuya, all of whom she looks up to, in the fight against Duel Academy. By the time they are in Duel Academy Riley has enough confidence challenge Declan to a Duel when he initially rejects her plan to revive  Ray Akaba .
 Her change in attitude is further shown during her Duel with Sector Security, where she Duels all three of them in a much more confident nature without Declan being nearby, as she was able to Fusion, Synchro, and Xyz Summon in her turn. This is something she seemed unwilling to do in her Duel with Allie until she saw Declan watching her.
 Riley suffers from  PTSD  as she saw images of the soldiers that attacked her hometown, and she clutched her head in agony. This is best shown against the Obelisk Force after a prolonged Duel against multiple members.
 
 Abilities 
 Riley is shown to hear the cries and roars of the  Four Dimension Dragons . When she first saw " Starving Venom Fusion Dragon ", she gasped in fear. [11]  The second time  Yuri  Summoned it during a rematch with  Yugo , she was able to hear its roar and feel the dragon's anger. [12] 
 Having no sense of self, Riley was able to allow  Ray 's disembodied spirit to enter her body and possess it so she could participate in the final Duel with  Z-ARC . [13] 
 
 Etymology 
 Riley's last name,  Akaba , means "red horse", and is similar to the surname of  Seto  and  Mokuba Kaiba  (also ending in 馬, horse) from  Yu-Gi-Oh! , drawing a comparison between the two pairs of siblings.
 Riley's Japanese given name  Reira  is written with the kanji for "zero" and "silk/gauze/to spread out/Latin". "Zero" is shared between the Japanese names of Riley,  Declan Akaba  (Reiji) and  Leo Akaba  (Reo) and sounds similar to the 'Rei' of  Ray Akaba .
 Riley's English given name is of Irish origin and means 'valiant'. ('Declan', the name of Riley's adopted brother, is also an Anglicized Irish name.)
 In the Japanese version, Riley is referred to with gender-neutral pronouns, while in the dub, she is referred to as a boy. Her true gender was kept secret for most of the series, and most characters and fans assumed that Riley was male. Both her Japanese and dub names can be applied to either boys or girls.
 
 Voice/Mannerisms 
 In the dub, Riley uses photography terms while Dueling. For example, when she activated " Shutter Layer 1 ", she referred to  Allie 's " Aquaactress Guppy " as a "subject".
 
 Biography 
 History 
       Riley's war-torn home.     
         Riley is subjected to various tests.     
 Riley was found alone in a house in a war-ravaged city by the Akaba family. The Akabas took her in and ran tests on her. From the tests,  Henrietta  concluded she would be a perfect Duel soldier for them as she had no "sense of self", meaning she would either be able to become a different person or be a mindless puppet following orders. [4]  Her adoptive brother  Declan , knowing what her life had been like, gave her " C/C Critical Eye ", telling Riley that her life had no light in it, so she must capture the light of her opponents. Under Declan's tutelage, Riley quickly became a strong Duelist. [14] 
 
 Arc League Championship 
 Riley was  Allie 's first opponent in the Youth Championship. She at first looked reluctant to Duel, but when she looked at her mother and she said something to her, she eventually Dueled. Allie initially had the upper hand with her " Aquaactress " monsters, but when Riley noticed her older brother watching her Duel, Riley turned the Duel in her favor by  Fusion Summoning  and defeated Allie with " C/C/C Water Sword of Battle ". After the Duel, Tate tried to approach her, but Riley just walked past him to meet her brother, who patted her head as he praised her for her victory and expected her to keep winning. [6] 
 She watched the Duels between  Yuya Sakaki  and  Sylvio Sawatari [15] [16]  and  Sora Perse  and  Shay Obsidian  with Declan and Claude. [15] [15] [17]  She looked nervous as she watched them Duel, but Declan told her to watch closely. [18]  She also watched the Duel between Sora,  Yuto , and Yuya, with Declan, Claude, and Shay, reacting nervously at the sight of Yuto and with surprise at her brother's emotional reaction to Yuto's tale. [19] [20] 
 
         Riley winning the Youth Championship.     
 In the second round, Riley Dueled  Frederick  and this time won by using a  Synchro Summon , shocking Yuya who suspected that she can also use multiple summoning methods like Declan. [21]  In the final match of the Youth championship, Riley Dueled against Tate and  Xyz Summoned  " C/C/C Rock Armor of Battle ". By using its  effects  to gain  ATK  equal to the  DEF  of itself and Tate's " Performachine Gadget Giant " and then  negating  the latter monster's effects, Riley won the Duel and became the champion of the Youth class championship. Tate congratulated Riley and compared her to her brother, and Riley thanked him with a timid smile. [5] 
 
 Friendship Cup 
 Afterwards, Riley and  her mother  were going to meet  Declan , but Declan was outside, challenging  Yuya  to a Duel. [5]  After the Duel, the next day, Riley was chosen as one of the  Lancers , much to Shay and  Sylvio 's objections, but Declan firmly stated that Riley's skill is powerful enough to fight  Duel Academy  and she won't be a hindrance. Riley, along with her brother and the other Lancers then went to the  Synchro Dimension . [22] 
 
         Riley arriving in the Synchro Dimension with Yuya, Celina, and Sylvio.     
 Upon arriving, the Lancers were split, and Riley ended up with Yuya, Sylvio, and  Celina . As soon as they got there  Sector Security  arrived and tried to arrest Yuya and Celina, confusing them with  Yugo  and  Zuzu . Scared by their hostility, Riley tried to flee but was stopped by a barrier of " Gate Blockers ". [9] 
 Yuya grabbed Riley's hand and took her along as he Dueled a Sector Security officer. Remembering his mother's words about spreading smiles, Yuya attempted to get Riley to open up to him, but failed because Riley was more concerned about where her brother was. Fortunately, Riley and the others were rescued by  Crow Hogan  and his gang in an escape plan. [10]  Riley and the others were invited to stay at Crow's hideout and Riley remained by herself, refusing to socialize with  the   others  despite  Amanda 's coaxing. When she overheard Sylvio remind the group that they had to look for Declan, Riley's attention was caught and she attempted to leave with Sylvio and Celina, but Yuya held Riley back. [23] [24]  Riley remained at Crow's place, still keeping to herself and worried without her brother, though Yuya reassured Riley that they would find Declan. The next day,  Shinji Weber  showed up and dropped off some items for the kids, encouraging Riley to join in. After he left, Crow was able to get Riley to eat with the kids. After Yuya and Crow were arguing over who could make Riley smile, they got into a Duel. When Sector Security officers showed up, Riley was rescued by  Moon Shadow  while everyone else was captured. [25] 
 
         Riley refusing to Duel  Shinji .     
 Riley was reunited with her brother [26]  and she was asked to participate in the  Friendship Cup . [27]  However, Riley did not want to fight her opponent, Shinji, and she fled to Yuya's room for comfort. Declan followed her, and ignoring Yuya's anger, he asked Riley why she didn't want to Duel Shinji. Riley timidly explained that Shinji had offered her sweets during her time at Crow's hideout. Realizing that Riley was reluctant to Duel someone who had done her a kindness, Declan ordered Moon Shadow to take Riley's place in the match. Declan concluded Riley's reluctance to Duel her benefactor stemmed from a budding "sense of self". Thinking about the possibly positive effects this could have, Declan imagined their mother being displeased about the development. [4] 
 During the next Duel, Riley was worried that Declan would like Moon Shadow more than her. Fearing that Moon Shadow could replace her if he won, she was displeased when Moon Shadow dealt damage to Shinji repeatedly and desperately wanted him to lose. She was happy when Shinji won the Duel, even if this meant losing her guardian. [28] 
 After Moon Shadow escaped the  Underground Labor Facility  to inform Declan about the rumors surrounding  Jean-Michel Roget , Riley told the ninja about her desire to fight against Duel Academy and her wish for Yuya to win the Friendship Cup and Duel against Jack one more time, since this was the only way  New Domino City  residents would acknowledge the Lancers and their mission in the Synchro Dimension. Riley also apologized to Moon for wanting him to lose. [29] 
 
 Friendship Cup Finals 
         Riley Duels against  Sector Security .     
 Jean-Michel Roget  rebelled against the  High Council  and imprisoned them,  Declan , and Riley in the Capital Building. After  Yuya  defeated  Shinji  in the second round and fled the stadium, Riley asked where Yuya was; Declan reassured her that Roget would not cancel the tournament and Yuya would have to participate in another match eventually. He also noted that Roget was trying to win Yuya over to his side. [30] 
 She watched  Yugo  Duel  Celina [31]  and after she was defeated, Declan told Riley to rescue Celina because Roget wouldn't send her underground and he wanted Riley to stop him. After Celina was weakened by Sector Security gassing her and prepared to take her away, Riley stepped in to protect Celina. Although Sector Security officers opposed Riley with " Goyo Catapults ", Riley  OTKed  all three of them, each with a different type of  Extra Deck  Summon. Moon Shadow arrived and accompanied Celina and Riley to the Underground Labor Facility. [32]  During Yuya's Duel against  Crow Hogan  while they were on their way to underground,  Celina's bracelet  began to glow, causing them to wonder what was happening. [33]  The trio eventually began to tire, and Celina urged them to abandon her, but Riley and Moon Shadow refused to do so. As they moved into the sewers, Riley noticed that Celina's bracelet had stopped glowing. [34] 
 Riley was exhausted and Celina still weakened from the nerve gas when the three realized the presence of the  Obelisk Force . Riley and Moon Shadow refused to abandon Celina, and Riley successfully persuaded a reluctant Moon Shadow to leave her and Celina and gather the Lancers from the Underground for further assistance. Riley defended Celina, defeating several Obelisk Force members, but at this point, she was so tired that she was unable to deal with the Obelisk Force reinforcements. She started trembling in fear and recalled her traumatic memories of her childhood before her adoption. Fortunately, Yuya arrived on his Duel Runner to protect her and Celina. [35] 
 As Riley and Yuya defeated the reinforcements,  Barrett  arrived with more Obelisk Force soldiers. Riley tried to join the Duel between Yuya and Barrett, but the Obelisk Force approached her, causing her to see her traumatic memories again. [36]  Riley tried to protect Celina, but the Obelisk Force ignored her and attempted to capture Celina. However, they were stopped by Sora, now their ally, and were confronted by  Yuri  and more Obelisk Force soldiers. Yugo arrived to Duel Yuri, and they Summoned " Clear Wing Synchro Dragon " and " Starving Venom Fusion Dragon ", the monstrous appearance of "Starving Venom" terrifying Riley. [11]  She started to get worried after watching  something   happen  to Yuya until  Zuzu  arrived and her  bracelet  activated. Riley stood helplessly as Barrett took Celina back with him after being defeated by  Sergey Volkov , who also defeated Yuya and took Zuzu with him. [37] 
 After losing both Zuzu and Celina, Riley clung to Sora and formed a trust she rarely shared.  Gong ,  Chojiro Tokumatsu , and Sylvio arrived only find out what happened to Zuzu and Celina. Sora and Moon Shadow decided to go rescue Zuzu while Yuya and Gong tried to catch up with them, with Chojiro, Riley, and Sylvio remaining behind. [38]  After watching the  Commons  take on Sector Security, Riley's traumatic memories caused her to join the battle before being calmed down by Shay. When they arrived at the Capital Building, the front entrance was blocked by Sector Security. Before they could come up with a plan, Declan arrived and destroyed their Trap Cards with the effect of " D/D/D Duo-Dawn King Kali Yuga ". Riley smiled and reunited with Declan in a hug. After defeating Security, they went to get Yuya on Shay's " Raidraptors ", where they found Yuya, Gong,  Sam ,  Frank , Amanda and  Tarren  on the bridge to the  Duel Palace  about to be attacked by Commons who had mistaken them for retreating  Topsiders . Once he was in the stadium, Yuya challenged Jack to a Duel. [39] 
 Before the Duel could start, Roget sent Sector Security inside the stadium to stop them, but they were defeated by Declan, Chojiro, Gong, Shay, and Sylvio. Riley Dueled the last officer and remembered what Jack told her. She Synchro Summoned " C/C/C Rock Blaster of Battle " and defeated the final officer, impressing Jack and everyone else. [40]  When the Commons riots escalated, Riley joined the Lancers in heading out to stop them, explaining that they had come to the Synchro Dimension to stop fighting across all dimensions. She and Declan went to Sector Security headquarters. [41]  They found Moon there, who along with Sora had been defeated by Roget in a Duel. Riley, Declan and Moon found Roget assaulting Zuzu and Declan picked apart Roget's excuses before ordering him to beg New Domino City for forgiveness. Roget fled instead, and Riley slowed down to help the injured Moon. She tried to follow Declan into the room where Roget had fled, but Declan shoved her out. Moon reassured Riley that Declan was merely trying to keep her safe and he explained that Roget was a fearsome opponent who would face Declan with a Duel that he couldn't predict. [42]  The other Lancers eventually arrived, and Sora hacked through the door and allowed them to enter. Riley witnessed Roget's defeats by Declan and joined the other Lancers in pursuing him and Zuzu, and Yuya managed to save Zuzu. Refusing to lose, Roget activated an  Interdimensional Transportation machine , intending to teleport New Domino City into a void. Riley was swept away by the strong winds, but Declan saved her, while Roget fell into a wormhole. Another wormhole soon sucked in Zuzu, Yuya, Sylvio, Shay, and Gong before the machine broke down. Declan explained that their missing comrades were in another dimension, but they had no way to know which one. [43] 
 
 Heartland City 
 The  Lancers  wanted to stay and assist with the rebuilding effort in  New Domino City , but Shinji and Chojiro urged them to do their duty as Lancers. They traveled to the  Fusion Dimension , joined by  Crow  and  Sora , and procured a speedboat, catching up with  Captain Cutter 's ship just as  Yuya  was thrown from the mast. Crow saved Yuya from falling into the ocean, and Solo used " Battle at Sea " to attack the speedboat; Riley noticing the cannon fire. After Yuya and Sora defeated Solo, Riley asked  Moon Shadow  what he had in his hand, Moon Shadow told her that it was something that he had borrowed; a screw that he had taken from the steering wheel of Solo's ship, causing it to steer in circles and prompting a laugh from Riley. [44]  Riley was surprised when  Declan  revealed that he went to  Duel Academy  three years previously and asked Yuya's  father  for help. She also learned that Declan found out about  Revival Zero , another part of  the Professor's  plan involving  Celina  and  Yuri , that may include Yuya as well. Declan told Riley and the other Lancers to believe in their friends' strength and fight to the very end. After arriving at Duel Academy, Riley prepared to climb the cliff to charge into the Professor's lab. [45] 
 After climbing the cliff, they were surrounded by Duel Academy students before utilizing their plan to split into two groups, with Riley, Declan, and Sora continuing to the lab while the remaining Lancers Dueled the students. [46]  Along the way they met up with Yusho and  Alexis Rhodes , but they were confronted by Yuri. [47]  Alexis and Sora sealed off the corridors to trap themselves with Yuri; Riley was almost trapped as well, but Sora managed to save her, and Riley continued on with Declan and Yusho. [48]  They were confronted by Duel Academy students who took them directly to the Professor. [49] 
 
 Duel Academy 
 Riley was fearful at the sight of  Leo Akaba , but  Declan  calmed her down. She learned about Yusho and Leo's past creating the  ARC System  together and was surprised to learn that it came from the  Original Dimension . She also learned how Leo made  Duel Monsters  evolve with the ARC System, but that it lead to the world's ruin due to  Z-ARC  and his  four dragons . Elsewhere,  Yuri  Summoned " Starving Venom Fusion Dragon ", and Riley felt its presence and sensed a great anger, scaring her, and her fear intensified after Leo explained how Z-ARC became the  Supreme King Z-ARC  and destroyed everything. [12] 
 She was pleased when  Yuya  made it to the chamber and watched Leo seal  the Doktor  into  a card . She then learned how Leo created  four cards  that could defeat Supreme King Z-ARC, but they were stolen by his daughter  Ray , who defeated Z-ARC. She also learned that Ray had split into  Zuzu ,  Celina ,  Lulu Obsidian  and  Rin  and saw  ARC-V , which Leo planned to use to revive Ray and the fifth dimension, scaring Riley even more. Leo revealed that Yuya was one of Z-ARC's reincarnations, and Riley watched as Declan and Yuya challenge Leo to a Duel. [50]  Yuya  awakened  again during the Duel, and his anger scared Riley and caused her to pass out. [51]  She remained unconscious for the rest of the Duel, and  Yusho  took care of her, handing her unconscious body to Declan after he  terminated  the Duel. [52] 
 
         Riley conveying the will of Ray's spirit.     
 Riley came into contact with the spirit of Ray as she woke up, and she told Declan that Ray wanted to be revived in order to stop Z-ARC. Declan reminded Riley that everyone would disappear if the Four Dimensions fused, and Riley asked him if he didn't want to revive his real older sister. Declan in response asked if Riley was fine with everyone vanishing. Ray's spirit appeared next to Riley, and she told Declan that Ray only had him and she challenged Declan to a Duel. Declan locked Riley's usual tactics down with " Dark Contract with the Eternal Darkness ", so Riley stalled with " Film Magician ", but Declan destroyed it with " D/D/D Boulder King Darius ". Riley managed to stay in the Duel by finding " Damage Banish " to reduce the damage from the attack of " D/D/D Flame King Genghis " to zero. On her next turn she used " Photo Frame " to copy "Dark Contract with the Eternal Darkness" and " Pure Ray " to destroy both "Dark Contracts, then brought out " C/C Critical Eye  and used " Montage Fusion " to  Fusion Summon  " C/C/C Sonic Halberd of Battle ". Riley used the effect of "Sonic Halberd" to attack all of Declan's monsters, [14] , but to her surprise, Declan used " Miracle " to survive the attack and defeated her on his next turn, blasting her into a pillar. Yuri arrived and blasted Declan next to Riley, and Ray's spirit explained to Riley, who explained so to Declan, that Z-ARC's revival was approaching. She and Declan watched Yusho's  Dueltaining  against Yuri. [53] 
 Yuya explained the effects of Yusho's cards to Riley, and Declan explained to Riley that Yuya had returned to himself. Riley was surprised when Yuri used " Ivy Bind Castle " to lock Yusho down, and she heard Yuya discussing the situation with someone else; Declan explained that Yuya was communicating with  Yuto  in his mind. Riley became worried when Yuri began acting more confident after he drew a card, and she was surprised when Yuri revealed that " Super Polymerization " wasn't his trump card, but " Ultra Polymerization ". Yuri used it to Fusion Summon "Starving Venom Fusion Dragon" and  Synchro Summon  " Clear Wing Synchro Dragon ", and set up a loop combo to continuously damage Yusho. Riley tried to stop Declan from joining the Duel, but Declan did not stop until Yusho told Declan not to interfere. Yuri defeated Yusho and sealed him into a  card , prompting the enraged Yuya to break free from "Binding Swords of Impact". [54] 
 Riley ran to check on Declan after he was blasted back by Yuya's shockwave and she worried about Yuya as he writhed in pain. She told Declan that Ray had claimed that Z-ARC's revival was inevitable. Yuri brought out "Clear Wing" again, and Riley worried that Yuya might lose like Yusho had. Fortunately, Yuya  sealed  the effects of "Starving Venom" and "Clear Wing". She worried that Yuya wasn't himself anymore after the  Four Dimension Dragons  began resonating, blasting her away until Declan caught her. Declan reassured Riley that Yuya was still fighting for the world, but Riley continued to worry about Yuya when his counterparts started to  synchronize  with him. [55]  Distortions in space began occurring, and Declan explained to Riley that ARC-V had started the dimensional integration. Yuya blasted Riley with another shockwave, and Riley feared that Yuya was going to join Yuri, but Yuya simply  Set  a card. To their surprise, Leo trapped them in the  Isolation Dome , separating them from the Earth, and Riley told Declan that he couldn't hear Ray's voice anymore. Riley, Declan,  Sora , and  Aster Phoenix  attempted to join the Duel to protect Yuya, but Yuri blasted them away. Yuya used " Break Away " to end a  Battle Phase , but he broke down afterwards due to discarding his " Smile World " card. Riley told Yuya that she believed in him, and Declan managed to convince Yuya to focus on learning. She was happy when Yuya  regained and took control  of "Dark Rebellion" and "Clear Wing", and she was surprised to see Yuto and  Yugo  supporting Yuya with their dragons. Yuya defeated Yuri, but to Riley's horror, Yuya fell under the influence of the darkness and summoned " Astrograph Sorcerer " to fuse with the Four Dimension Dragons. Riley ran outside with Declan, Sora, and Aster to find the world floating in pieces, and the Supreme King Z-ARC hovering at the center. [56] 
 As Z-ARC began to attack the  Fusion Dimension , Riley felt the presence of Ray, and she asked Declan whether Leo was still inside; Declan explained that Leo was cautious enough to leave himself an escape route. Riley told him that Ray's voice was calling Leo to hurry and revive her since only she could defeat Z-ARC, and she ran back into Duel Academy with Declan following her. [57]  As space continued to warp through Duel Academy, Riley and Declan found themselves walking in circles. Riley was scared by apparent ghosts walking through her and Declan, but to her surprise, Declan noted that they were the citizens of  Heartland  and  New Domino City . [58]  As they continued travelling through Duel Academy, Riley learned from Ray that Leo was trying to split the world again using the  four cards  that had been revived instead of her. [59] 
 
         Riley meets Ray inside ARC-V.     
 Riley explained that Leo was planning on using the same cards that Ray had used to defeat Z-ARC. She begged Declan to save Leo, claiming that Declan wouldn't be able to smile if their father sacrificed himself. Declan agreed, and he told Riley to stay where she was as he left to assist his father. Riley was about to follow Declan until Ray contacted her. Riley went to ARC-V, where she met Ray's spirit in a visible state. [60] 
 
         Riley sealing Z-ARC inside her own body.     
 Riley offered to become Ray's vessel, and they ran to assist Declan. As she tripped while running,  Moon Shadow  appeared to help her up. She arrived at the Duel just as Z-ARC defeated Declan, though Moon Shadow saved Declan and Leo from serious injuries as Riley joined the Duel. Riley removed her hood and cap, revealing her long hair as Ray took possession of her and opposed Z-ARC. Using Riley's body, Ray retrieved the Natural Energy Cards from the  Graveyard  and activated them to slowly strip away " Supreme King Z-ARC 's" protection effects and causing the  Natural Energy Bracelets  to materialize on Riley's arm. "Z-ARC" was destroyed, though Z-ARC still had enough  LP  to remain in the Duel. He insisted that Yuya was no more, but Ray maintained that Yuya still existed. Yuya was indeed able to fight for control after being contacted by Zuzu's spirit, and he revived "Z-ARC" and " Supreme King Servant Dragon Odd-Eyes " and  increased  Riley's LP, allowing Ray to defeat Z-ARC with the effects of the Natural Energy Cards. Riley then ejected Ray's spirit from her body, and she sealed Z-ARC's spirit within her own body to prevent his soul from being split again, and Yuya called Riley's name in horror. [13] 
 
         Riley as an infant.     
 Following the battle with Z-ARC, Riley was reverted into an infant in a catatonic state, and both Declan and  Henrietta  decided to use Yuya's strength to "bring Riley's smile back". [61]  When Yuya regained his memories of Zuzu, Declan revealed that Riley expelled Ray's soul in order to seal Z-ARC's soul and was reborn as a baby without a smile due to the dimensional split. Nevertheless, he still believed that Riley's smile would definitely return since they took back their memories for that reason. [62]  After everyone regained their memories, Henrietta showed Riley to Yuya, and Declan revealed that the Natural Energy Cards purified Riley, turning her back into a baby as Z-ARC and Ray had been previously. Declan believed that the reason Riley didn't separate into four people was to quickly seal Z-ARC's soul, which took her smile away. He then revealed the reason for reenacting the Arc League Championship was to return Riley's smile and save the world through Yuya's Dueltaining; if Riley and Z-ARC could not find enjoyment in Yuya's Dueltaining, Z-ARC would eventually resurrect and likely put the world at risk again.  [63] 
 Riley watched Yuya Duel  Dennis  and win, but she still didn't smile. [64]  Declan also revealed to Yuya that Riley didn't react to Duel with  Shay . When Yuya summoned the Four Dimension Dragons during his Duel against  Jack , Riley began to react to them due to Z-ARC's soul, emitting a dark aura. [1]  She calmed down when Z-ARC's soul subsided after Yuya won the Duel, causing the dark aura to disappear, but she still didn't smile. While watching Yuya and Declan's Duel, Riley started to cry when Yuya regained a memory of Z-ARC and what he truly wanted was to entertain everyone and not destroy the world. [65]  Riley continued to cry until Yuya won, when she and Z-ARC began to laugh happily. [66] 
 
 Relationships 
 Henrietta Akaba 
 Riley's relationship with her adoptive mother is in the simplest terms, nonexistent. She constantly drives fear into the girl, whether she is present or not. In fact, once when  Declan  said  Henrietta  would be disappointed in her, Riley went into a state of extreme panic. [4]  Henrietta apparently wished to use Riley as a mindless puppet for the war against her  husband , something Declan was against.
 The battle with Z-ARC caused her to have a profound change of heart. After the battle with Z-ARC and Riley's conversion into an infant, Henrietta was struck with guilt over planning to use Riley as a weapon for revenge and became desperate to bring "her smile back". She was visibly horrified at the prospect that Yuya's failure may lead to Riley living an irreparable fate and blamed herself for it because it was her idea to make her a Duel soldier in the first place, finally seeing Riley as her beloved daughter.
 
 Declan Akaba 
 Declan  and Riley's relationship is reminiscent of the  Truesdale   brothers  of Yu-Gi-Oh! GX, as they are shown to care about each other, and they use similar Dueling styles to one another, as both Riley and Declan utilize multiple summoning methods.
 Although they aren't related biologically, Riley was encouraged by Declan's compliments after her victories during the  Arc League Championship  and was allowed to join the  Lancers  despite not being at the  Battle Royal . When some of the Lancers complained about Riley joining, Declan quickly defended her and said that she would not be a hindrance, and constantly shows his confidence in Riley's skills.
 When the Lancers were split in the  Synchro Dimension , Riley cared about nothing but finding Declan as soon as possible, and Declan requested  Moon Shadow  to find Riley, later to take her place in the  Friendship Cup . When Riley showed signs of developing a "sense of self", he was shown to be proud and resents his mother's plan of using Riley as a mindless puppet.
 
 Yuya Sakaki 
 When the  Lancers  arrived in the  Synchro Dimension  and were split Yuya immediately noticed Riley's concern over  Declan 's whereabouts and her shyness. Yuya quickly became protective of Riley and made it his goal to make Riley smile. When Yuya was arrested by  Security  he was more worried about Riley's safety and was shown to be relieved when Riley was confirmed to be fine.
 When Riley was scheduled to Duel  Shinji  in the  Friendship Cup  and ran off to Yuya, Yuya angrily scolded Declan for forcing Riley to participate in the tournament and demanded to know why he made Riley a Lancer, worried that Riley is too young to face the dangers that being a Lancer comes with. 
 Yuya's care for Riley has in turn affected Riley, who now looks up to Yuya in addition to Declan and Moon Shadow. With both Riley and Moon Shadow unable to participate in the Friendship Cup, Riley asks Yuya to win the Cup for them. Moon Shadow also gave Yuya the message that Riley is grateful for his help.  
 After running from Security and dealing with the Obelisk Force, Riley was greatly weakened and recalling her mental trauma; she was no longer in the position to wait for Moon Shadow or protect Celina. She was hugely relieved when Yuya came to her rescue at the last minute (ironically thanks to the flare signal) just as another batch of Obelisk Force approaches during the start of the invasion. 
 
 Moon Shadow 
 Moon Shadow  became a protector of sorts for Riley in the Synchro Dimension, rescuing her from Security. However, when Moon Shadow replaced Riley in the Friendship Cup, Riley became jealous, desiring Moon Shadow's loss. She later expressed remorse over this and apologized, expressing the desire to prove her strength to Moon Shadow in addition to Yuya and Declan.
 
 Jack Atlas 
 Riley seems to respect  Jack , despite also being intimidated by him. After having a meal alongside Jack and hearing him tell his story, Riley is inspired to come out of her shell. [29] 
 
 Celina 
 Riley saves Celina during the Friendship Cup on Declan's orders and subsequently refuses to abandon her. In turn, while Celina is grateful for Riley's rescue, she dislikes holding Riley and Moon back and tries to order them to leave her.
 
 Ray Akaba 
 Riley's relationship with her adoptive sister was one of mutual support. Riley was the only one who could sense Ray's will, knowing this Ray repeatedly contacted her asking for help. Riley in turn agreed which led her to temporarily betray Declan and challenge him to a Duel with Ray's guidance hoping to ensure her full revival.
 When Ray failed to be fully revived physically, Riley volunteered to let Ray use her body to go confront and defeat Z-ARC once again and rescued Yuya. Ultimately Riley sealed Z-ARC into herself to prevent him from splitting again but ejected Ray from her body so she wouldn't be affected by it, which in turn caused Riley to become a baby.
 
 Deck 
         Riley and " C/C Critical Eye ".     
 Riley runs a  " C/C " Deck , which utilizes the "Shutter"  Spell  and  Trap Cards  focused on copying the opponent monsters to use them as  Materials . While her "C/C" and "Shutter" cards seem unrelated, they both share a camera motif. She also uses non-"C/C" monsters with a filming theme.
 The Deck focuses around using " C/C Critical Eye " to  Fusion ,  Synchro  and  Xyz Summon  the "C/C/C" monsters. The effect of "Critical Eye" doesn't allow Riley to use other monsters she control as Materials, which is compensated by her Spell and Trap Cards that allow her to copy the name,  Level  and  Attribute  of the opponent's monsters. The "C/C/C" monsters require "C/C Critical Eye" and a monster with the corresponding Attribute to be Summoned, and their effects take advantage of the opponent controlling monsters with the same Attribute. With "Critical Eye" being just one card, she does not always have it at her disposal immediately. She compensates for this with her "Shutter" Spell and Trap Cards and the  stalling  effect of "Film Magician".
 Thematically, Riley's Deck is similar to her brother  Declan's , in that she is able to perform multiple types of  Extra Deck  Summons. The names of her cards, "C/C" and "C/C/C," are based on Declan's " D/D " and " D/D/D " archetypes in naming structure. Furthermore, her "Shutter" Spell and Trap Cards could be considered a "C/C" variant of of her brother's " Dark Contract " cards.
