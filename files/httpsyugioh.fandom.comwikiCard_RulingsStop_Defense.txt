 Previously Official Rulings 
   These TCG rulings were issued by  Upper Deck Entertainment  and have since been deemed unofficial by Konami. [1]  They were previously considered official and can still be correct, as long as they follow the official gameplay rules, or unless Konami has issued a ruling that says otherwise. References:  [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] 
 
 Using " Stop Defense " on a face-down monster does not constitute a  Flip Summon , so " Trap Hole " could not be used. 
 Mentions in Other Rulings 
 Dragon Capture Jar :  If " Stop Defense " is activated targeting a  Dragon - Type  monster, it is switched to  Attack Position , but then is immediately changed back to  Defense Position  since the effect of " Dragon Capture Jar " is continuous. 
 Spellbinding Circle :  The  Battle Position  of a monster targeted by this card can still be changed by card effects, such as..." Stop Defense "... 
 Total Defense Shogun :  " Total Defense Shogun " does not permanently remain in  Defense Position . After the turn that " Total Defense Shogun " is Summoned, you can change his battle position as normal. He can also have his battle position changed with card effects like " Stop Defense ".
