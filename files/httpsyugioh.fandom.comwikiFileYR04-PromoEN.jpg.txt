 Special rules 
 The end of Volume 4 outlines the set of rules that the  Yu-Gi-Oh! R  series follows. They are based off of the  Super Expert Rules  fundamentally, with a few changes:
 Game Start 
 
 Both  players  start out with 4000  Life Points . 
 Both players  draw  six cards at the beginning of the  Duel . On their first  turn  they draw one card, so each hand has seven cards. It is set up this way because the  Ceremonial Battle  began with a sixth card hand in the manga. 
 Main Phase 
 
 On your own turn, you may activate up to one spell card from your hand. Unlike in the  Official Card Game  rules, you can't activate several at a time when the field is empty. 
 You can only  place  one  spell card  and one  trap card  card  face-down  during your turn. If you try to cheat and put down two spell cards or two trap cards, your  Duel Disk  will sound an alarm. 
 Face-down spell cards can be activated whenever the phase changes, including during your opponent's turn. 
 Face-down trap cards can be activated whenever their trigger event occurs, beginning from the moment they are set on the field. 
 Monsters may be  summoned  in  attack mode  or in  defense mode . In the  Official Card Game , monsters can be set as well. In this manga, they aren't used that way, but they probably could be. After using a fusion spell card, the Fusion Monster can't attack. 
 Battle Phase 
 
 When only one monster attacks, everything is the same as it is in the Official Card Game rules, including damage calculation. 
 When several monsters attack: 
 Choose which monsters participate in the attack. 
 Choose which of your opponent's monsters each of your monsters will attack. 
 Attack! Begin damage phase. 
 At this point, all damage to all monsters is dealt simultaneously. In the manga, it is sometimes drawn as though the damage is dealt in a certain order, but it really happens simultaneously.
 For example, in the battle between  Yugi  and  Depre Scott  in volume 3, Depre attacks with " Eva Epsilon " and " Greed Quasar ." As Yugi takes damage from "Greed Quasar," he activates " Fit of Rage ," but when the damage to " Toy Magician " and "Eva Epsilon" is calculated, this is not reflected. That is because both the damage to Yugi which triggered "Fit of Rage" and the "Toy Magician" counter-attack were treated as having occurred simultaneously, with "Fit of Rage" applied after the battle phase.
