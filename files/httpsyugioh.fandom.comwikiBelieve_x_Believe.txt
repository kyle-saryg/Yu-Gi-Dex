 Trivia 
 The way this song's name is pronounced is a pun on "biribiri", an onomatopoeia for electricity sparking, as electricity can be heard several times in the song when the name is sung. This is also reflected in the PV's choreography, in which the members of the band dance as if they were being electrocuted when they sing "biribiri". 
 At the beginning of the video, Yuya's silhouette appears on four cards. This could be an early reference to him and his  dimensional counterparts ,  Yuto ,  Yugo , and  Yuri .
