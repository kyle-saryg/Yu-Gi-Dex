 Overview 
 Compared to the futuristic structures of  Heartland , its design and style are more old-fashioned. Only  Kari 's room was remodelled with the latest technology for receiving news from around the world to assist in her job as freelance reporter. Even though  Yuma  has his own room, he choose to sleep in the attic with lots of items that were filled with leftover memories from their parents.
 It is located within  Heartland City , in walking distance of  Heartland Academy , but Yuma is always late for school for oversleeping. Before they disappeared,  Kazuma Tsukumo  and  Mira Tsukumo  used to live in this house with their children and  Kazuma's mother .
