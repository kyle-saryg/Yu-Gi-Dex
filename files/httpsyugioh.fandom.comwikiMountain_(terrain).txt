      The Mountain terrain.     
 The  Mountain  field was shown briefly in  Duelist Kingdom . It was used by  Mai Valentine  for her " Harpie Lady " monsters. It appeared to power up  Winged Beast - Type  monsters.
 In early video games, the field can be changed to Mountain by activating " Mountain ", which grants the  ATK  and  DEF  changing effects of " Mountain " to the affected area.
