 The  dice game [1]  was a simple  die  roll  Shadow Game  in the  Yu-Gi-Oh!  manga , played by  Dark Yugi  and the  ZTV director .
 The rules were whoever rolled lowest won and if it was a draw, the director won.
 The die used in this game had the  Eye of Anubis  as on its 1 face.
 
 Events 
 The director abused  Yugi  by having  A.D. Fujita  beat him up, so they could stage a documentary on bullying,  Caught on Camera: School Violence . However  Jonouchi  broke up the fight and confronted the director when he found out what was happening. However the director was able to prevent Jonouchi from fighting, by reminding him that they were being filmed and freely attacked Jonouchi himself, having control over what was and wasn't recorded.
 Yugi switched to  Dark Yugi  and followed the director to a parking lot at the  ZTV  studio. Dark Yugi challenged the director to the die game. The director wasn't interested in playing, but had Dark Yugi roll anyway. Dark Yugi got a 6, making the director think it was impossible for Dark Yugi to win. Dark Yugi insisted that the game wasn't over until the director rolled. Fed-up, the director took the die and fired it at Dark Yugi's face. Dark Yugi deflected the die by holding up the  Millennium Puzzle . When it landed the director thought he had rolled a 1. However, Dark Yugi showed him that the die had broken in two and landed on a 6 and a 1, making his roll 7.
 Dark Yugi inflicted the Mosaic Illusion  Penalty Game  on the director, causing his vision to pixelate (with the poetic justice being that the director was censored as punishment for bending the truth in front of cameras).
