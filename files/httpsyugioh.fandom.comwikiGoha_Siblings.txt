 The 6 Goha Siblings are the true presidents of the  Goha Corporation .
 Each Goha Sibling appears to represent a different  Attribute  that can be inferred by the color of their robe, and each practices a hobby that seems to be inspired by that Attribute and uses a Deck that includes exclusively monsters of that Attribute. While the Goha Siblings refer to themselves as the six Goha presidential siblings, the identity of the sixth sibling is unknown even to the other siblings (up until  Episode 77 , at least), though Yuo acquires their presidential badge through unknown circumstances.

 Trivia 
 Yuka Goha is the only Female Goha Sibling. 
 Yuka Goha, Yuo Goha, and Yuga Goha are the only Goha Siblings to duel more than once. 
 Yuran Goha is the only Goha Sibling that has a 100% record against Yuga's group, having only dueled  Gavin Sogetsu  and won. 
 Yuga Goha is the first Shadow Duelist in the  Yu-Gi-Oh!  anime franchise since  Yu-Gi-Oh! 5D's .
 In addition, the  penalty game  Yuga Goha inflicts on  Luke  at the end of  Episode 79  of SEVENS is the same penalty game that  Pegasus  inflicted on  Solomon Muto  and the  Kaiba   brothers  during the  Duelist Kingdom arc .
