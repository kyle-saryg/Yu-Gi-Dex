 Shonen Jump  was a monthly anime and manga magazine published in North America by  Viz Media , based on its Japanese counterpart,  Weekly Shōnen Jump . In addition to serializing chapters from various manga series and containing anime- and manga-related news, the magazine also features articles on anime- and manga-related video games, card games, and even Japanese language and culture. The first issue was released in November 2002 with a January 2003 cover date. The April 2012 issue was the last scheduled printed issue of the magazine before converting to the digital format "Weekly SHONEN JUMP Alpha". [1] 
 There is additional  Shonen Jump  content, including online previews and serialization of various manga series and fan-focused blog posts, on the magazine's official website, though much of the additional content is only available to subscribers. It also has online-only sister publications,  Shonen Sunday  and  IKKI , and an anime-focused counterpart,  VIZ Anime .

 Promotional cards 
 Main article:  Shonen Jump promotional cards 
 Some issues of  Shonen Jump  feature promotional  Yu-Gi-Oh! Trading Card Game  cards. Most of these are offered for free in newsstand copies, but some are only offered to subscribers, and one card, " Troposphere ", has been offered only in the Scholastic Edition of the magazine. Other promotional cards are available as subscription bonuses or through mail order.
 Because  Shonen Jump  is only distributed in North America, promotional  Shonen Jump  cards are not tournament-legal in Europe, Oceania, or Central or South America unless the card has been otherwise released in those regions. [2]
