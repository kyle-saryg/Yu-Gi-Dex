 This card's  Special Summon  method resembles the Special Summon method of " Gagaga Gardna ". 
 This card's  effect  is the opposite of that of " Damage Mage ". 
 Chanbara is a term to refer to sword fighting movies, or " Samurai Cinema ". It literally means "Sword Fight". However, considering the sound trend in  Yuma 's Deck, it most likely refers to the sound of two swords clashing.
 The fact it is holding two swords might also be related to its name.
