 The  Floral Design Club , known as the  Ikebana Club  in the Japanese and Italian versions, is a club within Heartland Middle School in the  Yu-Gi-Oh! ZEXAL  anime. It is based on  ikebana . The club is led by  Lotus Hanazoe .
 The club was brainwashed by  Girag  in order to acquire the " Numbers "; however,  Rio Kastle  was able to defeat its leader, Lotus, and, subsequently, everyone returned to normal.
 The members of the club later appear during Heartland Academy Fun Fair, holding an ikebana event.
