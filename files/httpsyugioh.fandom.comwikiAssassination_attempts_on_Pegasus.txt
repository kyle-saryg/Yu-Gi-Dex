 Bandit Keith 
       Keith  holds a gun to  Pegasus ' head.     
 Keith and Pegasus faced each other in  a Duel  in front of a large audience and on television. Pegasus made a fool of Keith by  reading his mind  and giving instructions to a child,  Sam , to defeat Keith. [1]  Keith fell into a depressive slump and began to harbor a grudge against Pegasus.
 Keith later infiltrated the  Duelist Kingdom  tournament to get revenge on Pegasus. He arranged a group of four Duelists including himself,  Bonz ,  Sid  and  Zygor  to try and cheat their way into  the castle  as the four finalists. However when that failed, he stole the other three’s  Star Chips  allowing just himself to qualify as a finalist. [2] [3] 
 Keith failed to get a chance to Duel Pegasus after losing to  Joey Wheeler  in the semi-finals, so he attempted to kill him by pulling out a gun. (In the dub, the gun was removed.) In the anime, Keith jumped up next to Pegasus with the gun, but Pegasus activated a secret switch, opening a trapdoor below Keith, causing him to plummet into the ocean. In the manga, Pegasus stopped him, by inflicting a  Penalty Game , turning Keith's hand into a gun, which uncontrollably shot himself in the head. [4] 
 
 Yami Bakura 
       Pegasus' death at the hands of  Dark Bakura     
 In the manga,  Dark Bakura  murdered Pegasus at the end of  Duelist Kingdom  by gouging the  Millennium Eye  out of his eye socket. He stole the eye and left a  replica  with Pegasus. [5] 
 
       Bakura and Pegasus in Shadow Game with their Millennium Items.     
 In the anime, Yami Bakura engaged in a  Shadow Game  with Pegasus, who had been weakened after Dueling  Yugi Muto  and releasing the souls of  Seto Kaiba ,  Mokuba Kaiba  and  Solomon Muto . Yami Bakura removed the eye afterwards, but it did not kill Pegasus.
 
 
 Paradox 
         Pegasus about to get crushed by a falling building.     
 Pegasus arrived at a Duel tournament in  Domino City , in which Yugi Muto was a participant. When  Paradox  arrived, he sent " Stardust Dragon ", " Rainbow Dragon ", and " Cyber End Dragon " to attack the surrounding buildings. In the ensuing destruction, a building lost its stability and fell on Pegasus, killing him. The resulting disruption in the time stream was to cause people, buildings, schools, and cities that arose from the cultural impact of the card game to start to become erased. The  Crimson Dragon  appeared and took the only survivor, Yugi, back in time 30 minutes before Pegasus was killed. This time around, Yugi,  Jaden Yuki , and  Yusei Fudo 's combined efforts stopped Paradox, thus the assassination was never completed. Pegasus landed via helicopter and gave out cards to children. [6]
