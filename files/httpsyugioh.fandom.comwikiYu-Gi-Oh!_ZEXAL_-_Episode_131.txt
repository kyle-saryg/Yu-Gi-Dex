 Summary 
       Nash  chained in darkness.     
 Nash  regains consciousness, finding himself chained in a sphere of darkness, lightning cracking outside of it. He wonders where he is, but then remembers he was captured by  Girag . He realizes the spell used to trap him is  Don Thousand 's power (Nash does not mention Thousand in the dub) and wonders why Girag would have it. A screen materializes in front of him and he sees  Dumon  and  Marin  confronting  Vector . Marin repeats Vector's claim that he plans to defeat them and steal the power from their souls. Nash says the names of both of his comrades, while Dumon asks Vector if he's really capable of such a feat (in the dub, Dumon says Vector has lost his mind, but the traitorous Barian Emperor interrupts him before he can continue). Vector responds that of course he can do that - as he's revived Don Thousand. Vector cackles as dark power surrounds him and Thousand materializes behind him. Marin mutters that this can't be, while Dumon simply asks "what?" (Dumon's reaction is cut from the dub). Thousand introduces himself as the God of the  Barian World  (in the dub, Thousand says the two Emperors standing before him must be surprised to see him). Nash is surprised Vector revived him. Thousand tells them it's time for them to become his slaves - they'll be the "food" that helps restore his power. Dumon asks why he would need their power if he's the god of the Barian World. Thousand insists it is their destiny - the  Seven Barian Emperors  were the chosen souls that were meant to revive his power. Vector says they were intended as Thousand's "food" from the very beginning (in the dub, Vector reassures his fellow Emperors that they will be part of the winning team for once). Marin points out that that applies to Vector too - he is one of the Seven Emperors, after all. Vector insists that it doesn't as Thousand's form dissipates. 
 
         Vector  declares he is a god, and emits waves of energy, knocking his opponents back.      He has become one with Don Thousand. As Thousand's power flies around, Vector yells that he is a God. The waves of darkness knock Dumon and Marin off their feet as Vector jumps down to their level and  Barian Battlemorphs . Vector cackles that the power is overflowing. Marin wonders if Vector really absorbed Thousand's power, while Dumon tells her to flee and go inform the others (in the dub, Marin says Vector won't have this power for long if she and Dumon gather the other Emperors; Dumon telling Marin to escape is cut from the dub). Vector laughs and asks if they haven't realized that Girag and  Alito  have been acting as his pawns (in the dub, Vector adds that the other Emperors can't help his opponents either). He adds that Alito sided with  Yuma  now though. Marin asks what he means and Vector says that Yuma and  Astral  are heading this way, with the traitor Alito in tow. He intends to crush them all with his own hands. Dumon points out they still have Nash on their side, though. Vector laughs and his eyes glow red with power as he asks if they really think that's still the case. Vector tells them he'll devour them all now, red energy waves emanating out. Marin says she and Dumon will have to combine their power to defeat him. Dumon agrees that they have no other choice (in the dub, Dumon says they will turn Vector into simply a bad memory). The two Barian Battlemorph, their  D-Pads  appearing on their arms in the process. Vector's also materializes and the three yell "Duel!"
       Vector equips " Don Thousand's Throne " to himself.     
 Yuma, Astral, Alito and  Tori  stand on the deck of the  Different Dimension Airship . They see something glowing up ahead. Tori asks what it is and Alito explains that its a dimensional crack - and beyond it lies the Barian World. Yuma simply repeats "beyond it" and looks pensive ("That means it's go time" in the dub). Back in the throne room, Vector tells his opponents that this Duel will be conducted as a  Battle Royal  (in the dub, Vector comments that a 2 on 1 Duel seems unfair to his opponents; he adds that he knows the end of this story and they won't like it). He takes the first  turn ,  drawing  the  Continuous Spell Card  " Don Thousand's Throne ". He cackles, saying an interesting card has arrived (in the dub, Vector tells the other two Emperors he will keep them in suspense and will make this Duel quick and painful). He  activates  it immediately. An ornate throne appears behind him and Vector seats himself in it. He says he could just sit here and beat them down leisurely, but he thinks that would be rude. Instead, he says he'll equip this card to himself. Tentacles wave out from the throne and ensnare him, giving him a new layer of armor. A red eye also opens in the center of his chest. 
 
         Vector with " Umbral Horror Will o' the Wisp " and two " Umbral Horror Ghosts ".     
 Marin asks what's going on, while Nash mutters that he feels a strange sensation as more lightning cracks outside his spherical prison. Vector activates the  effect  of the " Umbral Horror Ghost " in his  hand  as it contains two copies. This lets him  Special Summon  both of them in  Attack Position . He does so before proceeding to  Normal Summon  " Umbral Horror Will o' the Wisp ". As it was Summoned, its effect also activates, letting Vector change its  Level  to that of another " Umbral Horror "  monster  he  controls . It becomes Level 2 - the same as both "Ghosts". He  overlays  his three Level 2  DARK  monsters to  Xyz Summon  " Number 96: Dark Mist " in Attack Position, referring to it as the "messenger of deepest darkness" (in the dub, Vector asks Dumon and Marin if they've forgotten about it already). He tells "Dark Mist" to show them its true form. It morphs into a puppet-like version of its  avatar , its eyes shining yellow. Dumon seems to recognize it, but Vector asks if this is the first time he's seen it - the being that killed Astral once ("the fun Astral" in the dub). Marin points out that Vector partnered with him in the past (in the dub, Marin says  Yuma and Astral had destroyed Number 96 in the past ). Vector says that's true, but informs them after Number 96 and Astral killed one another, he absorbed the remaining power of Number 96, making it his puppet. He claims they will be devoured and become his puppets quite soon too. He  Sets  a card to end his turn, reminding his opponents that no one may  attack  on their first turn during a Battle Royal (in the dub, Vector remarks that Dumon and Marin becoming his puppets should be something to look forward to).
 
         " Number 102: Star Seraph Sentry " takes aim.     
 Marin's eyes narrow and she vows not to lose - for Nash's sake as well as her own (in the dub, Marin replies that she will take Vector down). Marin Normal Summons " Blizzard Thunderbird " and activates " Blizzard Vision ", explaining that it lets her  target  a  WATER  monster she controls and Special Summon this card as a monster with the same Level,  Attribute  and Type, but 0  ATK  and  DEF . She does so, then overlays her two Level 4 monsters to Xyz Summon " Number 103: Ragnazero " in Attack Position. Vector isn't surprised to see her ace right away, but calls her monster "cute" just the same. Marin Sets a card to end her turn. Dumon tells Vector that they will show him their own power (in the dub, Dumon swears to make Vector pay for his treachery). Dumon Normal Summons " Star Seraph Scout ", explaining that he can Special Summon another " Star Seraph " monster from his hand when he does. He Special Summons " Star Seraph Sage ", then activates the effect of "Sage", letting him  send  a  Spell Card  in his hand to the  Graveyard  to Special Summon another "Star Seraph" monster from his hand. He sends " Celestial Rage " to the Graveyard to Special Summon " Star Seraph Sword ". He overlays his three Level 4 monsters to Xyz Summon " Number 102: Star Seraph Sentry " in Attack Position. Dumon activates the effect of "Sentry",  detaching  an  Overlay Unit  to halve the ATK of a monster his opponent controls and  negate  its effects. "Sentry" fires its bow, impaling "Dark Mist" with an arrow, its ATK falling to 50. 
 Vector points out he only dropped the ATK by 50. Marin activates the effect of "Ragnazero", detaching an Overlay Unit as the ATK of a monster was reduced - this effect will  destroy  that monster. Marin declares " Doomsday Demoliton " as "Rangazero" hacks "Dark Mist" apart with its scythes. Dumon activates the  Quick-Play Spell Card  " Star Seraph Starscream ", inflicting 1000  damage  to Vector as a monster Vector controlled was destroyed when Dumon controls a "Star Seraph" monster. A shining pillar of energy blasts Vector backwards, crushing him against the stairs, cracking them in the process. Dumon and Marin asked how Vector liked the taste of their teamwork. Vector laughs and rises to his feet, saying they did get him (Vector's response is cut from the dub), while Marin reveals that when the effect of "Ragnazero" destroys a monster, she can draw a card. 
 
         " Number 43: Manipulator of Souls ", with the puppet " Number 96: Dark Mist " as its shield.     
 Dumon Sets a card and moves to end his turn, but Vector interrupts him, activating his  face-down  " Nightmare Xyz ". He explains that during the  End Phase  of a turn that a " Number " monster he controls was destroyed, he can target a  Rank  4 or lower DARK  Fiend - Type  Xyz Monster from his  Extra Deck  by using DARK monsters in the Graveyard as the Overlay Units, their Levels automatically being changed to the Rank of the chosen Xyz Monster. He Special Summons two "Ghosts" and "Will o' the Wisp", changing their Levels to 2. He overlays them to Special Summon " Number 43: Manipulator of Souls " in Attack Position. He reveals that upon its Summon, "Manipulator of Souls" can  equip  itself with a "Number" monster in his Graveyard, which will prevent it from being  destroyed by battle  or card effect. "Manipulator of Souls" lowers crimson strings into the Graveyard portal, pulling out the puppet form of "Dark Mist". Marin demands to know what he's trying to do (in the dub, Marin says she and Dumon can take whatever Vector can throw at them), but Vector instead activates the effect of "Don Thousand's Throne". At the end of a turn during which he received damage, his Life Points are restored by that same amount. He floats in the air, surrounded in an orb of red power. The tentacles on his armor absorb the energy, transferring it into him as he yells that the power is overflowing. As this happens, Nash screams in pain, the tentacles binding him glowing the same red. Vector thanks Nash for the meal as his Life Points return to 4000, then drops to the ground and reveals that he can now activate the effect of "Manipulator of Souls" as he gained Life Points. 
 
         Dumon  helps  Marin  up (this scene is cut from the dub).     
 As Vector gained Life Points, the effect of "Manipulator of Souls" activates, increasing its ATK by that same value and also damaging one of his opponents by said amount. The ATK of "Manipulator of Souls" becomes 1000 and Vector tells Marin to take that damage. As he yells " Licking Lash ", "Manipulator of Souls" strikes Marin with its lizard-like tongue, throwing her off her feet and dropping her Life Points to 3000. Dumon yells her name, but Marin quickly gets up, saying that that much damage was nothing. Both Emperors piece together Vector's strategy: when he gains Life Points, that amount is also inflicted as damage to either of them. Vector thinks to himself that this strategy will drain Nash's energy, though his opponents don't know that yet. He asks them what they think of his "invincible" monster. Dumon says they can't defeat him at all unless they  do so in one turn . Vector laughs at Dumon thinking they'll defeat him at all, as he is equal to a God. He draws and then orders "Manipulator of Souls" to attack "Sentry". Dumon is surprised as "Manipulator of Souls", shoots beams from its eyes, which "Sentry" spins its bow around to deflect back. 
 "Manipulator of Souls" is engulfed in an explosion and Vector is thrown backwards onto the stairs again, his Life Points now at 2500. Dumon asks why he'd destroy his own card, but Vector reminds him that as long as "Manipulator of Souls" has a "Number" equipped, it can't be destroyed. Vector activates the Quick-Play Spell Card " Card of Endurance " which inflicts 1000 damage to him when he has taken damage to begin with. Electricity engulfs him and he falls to the ground again, his Life Points now 1500. "Card of Endurance" also lets him draw a card. Vector Sets two cards and ends his turn. At the End Phase, the effect of "Don Thousand's Throne" activates, so he gains 2500 Life Points as Nash screams in pain and the ATK of "Manipulator of Souls" rises to 3500. He targets Marin for the damage again as "Manipulator of Souls" strikes her with its tongue (in the dub, Vector remarks that making Marin suffer is his new hobby). Her Life Points fall to 500 as Nash screams her name (in the dub, Nash yells, "No!") and she's thrown backwards again. Vector laughs as his eyes glow red and he tells Marin it's appropriate that one whose head was always held so high is crushed now. Dumon runs to her and asks Vector why he's only attacking her. Vector just cackles and Marin lays her hand on Dumon's shoulder to help her rise to her feet. She stares angrily at Vector (Dumon helping Marin is cut from the dub), who is pleased at how thoroughly he's humiliated her as an enraged Nash yells Vector's name. He says her Life Points are only 500 now, with just a bit more, she'll be sent to Hell - for sure this time. Marin asks what he means by "for sure this time" (in the dub, Vector remarks that he will defeat Marin again, just like old times; Marin simply repeats "again?"). Vector asks if she doesn't remember yet. Marin repeats, "remember?" and Vector says he'll tell them the shocking truth then. Using Ray's voice (in the dub, Vector uses his regular voice), he reveals to them that it was he who killed Marin and Nash in the Barian World. 
 
         Vector holding Marin hostage.     
 At that time, Vector had taken Marin hostage over a cliff somewhere near  Don Thousand's palace . Nash tells him to give up and release her and that he would spare Vector's life if he did. Marin urges Nash to stop worrying about her and just defeat Vector (in the dub, Marin tells Nash that Vector does not deserve any mercy). As red lightning strikes around the Barian World, Vector tells Nash not to make a move. Calling them both disgusting, he boasts that he'll send Marin to Hell now. Raising his arm, his hand glows with pink energy as he activates a  Trap Card  - " Giant Sky Sword ". Purple energy flares and drops straight down past the cliff, opening a portal. He claims the card will absorb them and render them unable to climb out of the abyss. Nash tells him to stop, but Vector throws Marin from the cliff. Yelling her name, Nash quickly follows. Vector calls him an idiot (in the dub, Vector did not say anything at this point). As he reaches her and grabs her hand, he says he can't move his body freely anymore (in the dub, Nash reassures Marin that he will never leave her no matter what lies straight ahead). They scream as the abyss absorbs them. Covered in light blue energy, the two stream through the portal at high speeds. Nash mutters that they can't keep this up (in the dub, Nash asks where they are; Marin says she isn't sure). 
 
         The souls of Nash and Marin are sent to  Earth .     
 They suddenly find themselves underwater.  Abyss  appears before them, kneeling. He says he's come to pick their "great king" up (in the dub, Abyss is honored to see his lord again). Nash asks who he is and he introduces himself as Abyss - the one who used to assist him. Nash can't remember that and Abyss adds that their souls must find new vessels in  the human world . Nash asks if they'll become human. Abyss confirms this and adds that their memories will be sealed until they meet Abyss once again. Abyss vanishes in a puff of bubbles. Nash says he understands that he's counting on Abyss. Marin resumes a light blue energy form, while Nash resumes a purple one. On Earth, two doctors and a nurse are at the bedsides of  Reginald  and  Rio Kastle . The devices monitoring their heart rates have just flatlined. One doctor asks the other how the kids' parents are. The other responds that its no good - they just died as well. The first doctor instructs a nurse to take the kids to the mortuary and contact the authorities. The nurse responds that she will, but suddenly their heart rates return and both kids open their eyes (the hospital staff mentioning the Kastle family's deaths are cut from the dub). The first doctor asks what happened, with the second adding that they've been revived. 
 In the present, Marin hangs her head. Dumon mutters her name and Marin says she remembers everything now. Dumon asks why Vector would do such a thing (Dumon's quote is cut from the dub). Vector responds it's quite simple - he doesn't like them. He says that ever since meeting Nash, he has disliked him. It was fate that the two of them would be unable to coexist. He claims he endured everything at first (in the dub, Vector says every word Nash spoke annoyed him and he knew that one of them had to be gone for good). He didn't kill them right away. He explains he made the "point system" instead. Dumon asks what he means and Vector says that each time Nash irritated him, he got 1 point. When he reached 1,000,000 points, Vector would kill him. Before that, he endured everything. He adds that each time Nash spoke, he got 1 point and also received a point each time he did anything at all. Using Ray's voice again, he adds it didn't take long for the points to accumulate (in the dub, Vector also adds that when he lashed out at Nash, Marin made the perfect bait). Dumon disdainfully mutters Vector's name (in the dub, Dumon says, "You fiend!") Vector says he never expected the two of them to still be alive though. Shaking with anger, Marin says they were revived in human bodies and lived as Reginald and Rio Kastle. They met Yuma and his comrades and forged a deep bond. When their Barian memories returned, Nash continued his mission, suffering in the process because he and Marin would have to fight their best friends. Vector calls it a refreshing situation ("Oh my, however did poor little Nash manage?" in the dub). 
 
         Marin's rage.     
 Enraged, Marin yells Vector's name ("I've had enough of you, Vector!" in the dub), her eyes glowing bright red and light blue energy spiraling around her. Back on the airship, the occupants near that dimensional crack that leads to the Barian World. Suddenly, " Number 106: Giant Hand " appears in front of the ship. It grasps the deck, stopping the airship. On it stands Girag. Marin asks Nash to lend her his power and performs a  Chaos Draw , drawing " Rank-Up-Magic - The Seventh One ". She activates it,  Ranking Up  "Ragnazero" and performing a  Chaos Xyz Evolution  to Special Summon " Chaos Number 103: Ragnafinity " in Attack Position. She vows not to let Vector live and adds that she will "freeze" him (in the dub, Marin tells Vector that she will take the pain she suffered and throw it back at him).
 
 Featured Duel: Vector vs. Marin and Dumon 
         The Duel begins.     
 This  Duel  is conducted as a  Battle Royal .
 Turn 1: Vector 
 Vector   draws  " Don Thousand's Throne " and subsequently activates it. As he has two copies of " Umbral Horror Ghost " in his  hand , Vector  Special Summons  both ( 2/200/200 each) in  Attack Position  through the effect of one copy. He then  Normal Summons  " Umbral Horror Will o' the Wisp " ( 1/0/0) in Attack Position. As it was summoned, Vector activates the effect of "Umbral Horror Will o' the Wisp" to change its  Level  to that of "Umbral Horror Ghost" (as it's an " Umbral Horror "  monster ) ("Umbral Horror Will o' the Wisp":   1 → 2). Vector  overlays  his two "Umbral Horror Ghosts" and "Umbral Horror Will o' the Wisp" in order to  Xyz Summon  " Number 96: Dark Mist " ( 2/100/1000, ORU: 3) in Attack Position. Vector  Sets  a card.
 Turn 2: Marin 
 Marin  draws. She then Normal Summons " Blizzard Thunderbird " ( 4/1600/1400) in Attack Position. She then activates " Blizzard Vision ", allowing her to target "Blizzard Thunderbird" (a  WATER  monster) and Special Summon "Blizzard Vision" as a monster (0/0) in Attack Position with the same Level,  Attribute  and  Type  as the targeted monster. Marin then overlays "Blizzard Thunderbird" and "Blizzard Vision" in order to Xyz Summon " Number 103: Ragnazero " ( 4/2400/1200, ORU: 2) in Attack Position. Marin Sets a card.
 
         Dumon  prepares to  overlay  his  monsters .     
 Turn 3: Dumon  
 Dumon  draws. He then Normal Summons " Star Seraph Scout " ( 4/1200/1800) in Attack Position. As it was Normal Summoned, Dumon Special Summons " Star Seraph Sage " ( 4/1600/1400) in Attack Position (as it's a " Star Seraph " monster). Dumon then activates the effect of "Star Seraph Sage" to  send  " Celestial Rage " (a  Spell Card ) from his hand to the  Graveyard  in order to Special Summon " Star Seraph Sword " ( 4/1400/1000) in Attack Position. Dumon then overlays "Star Seraph Scout", "Star Seraph Sage", and "Star Seraph Sword" in order to Xyz Summon " Number 102: Star Seraph Sentry " ( 4/2500/2000, ORU: 3) in Attack Position. 
 Dumon activates the effect of "Star Seraph Sentry" to  detach  an  Overlay Unit  ("Star Seraph Sentry": 3 → 2 ORU), halve the ATK of "Dark Mist" and  negate  its effects ("Dark Mist": 100 → 50 ATK). As the  original ATK  of "Dark Mist" was decreased, Marin activates the effect of "Ragnazero" to detach an Overlay Unit ("Ragnazero": 2 → 1 ORU), destroy "Dark Mist" and draw a card. As a monster was destroyed while Dumon controls a "Star Seraph" monster, Dumon activates " Star Seraph Starscream " to inflict 1000  damage  to Vector (Vector: 4000 → 3000 LP). Dumon Sets a card.
 
         " Don Thousand's Throne " restores  Vector 's  Life Points .     
 During the  End Phase , Vector activates his  face-down  " Nightmare Xyz " due to a " Number " monster he controlled being destroyed this turn. Through "Nightmare Xyz", Vector targets a  Rank  4 or lower DARK  Fiend - Type   Xyz Monster  from his  Extra Deck  in order to Special Summon as many monsters from his Graveyard as possible equal to the number of monsters needed to Xyz Summon the targeted monster and change their Levels to match the Levels of the monsters required to Xyz Summon the targeted monster. Vector Special Summons "Umbral Horror Will o' the Wisp" ( 1 → 2/0/0) and two copies of "Umbral Horror Ghost" ( 2/200/200 each) in Attack Position. Subsequently, Vector uses the final effect of "Nightmare Xyz" to overlay his two "Umbral Horror Ghosts" and "Umbral Horror Will o' the Wisp" in order to Xyz Summon " Number 43: Manipulator of Souls " ( 2/0/0, ORU: 3) in Attack Position. 
 As it was Xyz Summoned, Vector activates the second effect of "Manipulator of Souls" to  equip  itself with "Dark Mist" (a "Number" monster) from his Graveyard. Due to the third effect of "Manipulator of Souls", it can't be  destroyed by battle  or card effects while equipped with a "Number". The first effect of "Don Thousand's Throne" activates, increasing Vector's  Life Points  by the total amount of damage he took this turn (Vector: 3000 → 4000 LP). As Vector gained Life Points, the fourth effect of "Manipulator of Souls" increases its ATK by that value ("Manipulator of Souls": 0 → 1000 ATK) and inflicts damage to one his opponent's equal to that value. Vector chooses to inflict the damage to Marin (Marin: 4000 → 3000 LP).
 
         The effect of " Number 43: Manipulator of Souls " strikes  Marin .     
 Turn 4: Vector 
Vector draws. "Manipulator of Souls" attacks "Star Seraph Sentry", but the former monster is not destroyed due to its third effect (Vector: 4000 → 2500 LP). As he took damage. Vector activates " Card of Endurance " to increase the damage he took by 1000 (Vector: 2500 → 1500 LP) and draw a card. He then Sets two cards. On Vector's End Phase, the first effect of "Don Thousand's Throne" activates (Vector: 1500 → 4000 LP). The fourth effect of "Manipulator of Souls" activates and Vector chooses to inflict the damage to Marin ("Manipulator of Souls": 1000 → 3500 ATK, Marin: 3000 → 500 LP).
 Turn 5: Marin 
Marin performs a  Chaos Draw  and gets " Rank-Up-Magic - The Seventh One ". She then activates "Rank-Up-Magic - The Seventh One" to  Rank-Up  "Ragnazero" via  Chaos Xyz Evolution  in order to Xyz Summon " Chaos Number 103: Ragnafinity " ( 5/2800/2400. ORU: 2) in Attack Position.
