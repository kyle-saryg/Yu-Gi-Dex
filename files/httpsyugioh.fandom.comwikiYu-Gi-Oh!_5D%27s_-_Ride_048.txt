 Summary 
 Goodwin , with 200  Life Points  and the 12000 ATK " Celestial Conquering Dragon - Drago Ascension " speeds towards  Jack , whose  Duel Runner  is glowing crimson as he and " Jeweled Red Dragon Archfiend " meet him head on, with "Red Dragon's" 3000 ATK and Jack's 500 Life Points. Goodwin muses that Jack is playing at a  One-Shot Run ; with no hand and face-down cards, this is Jack's last gasp. He tells him to fall to one attack from "Drago Ascension" and calls Jack a sewer rat.
 Jack tells him to think again, and he activates the effect of the monster that was sent to his Graveyard by " Final Tombstone ;" " Absolute King Back Jack ." He  excludes  it from the Graveyard and draws a card. If the card is a  Trap Card , Jack can activate it immediately. Goodwin is initially shocked, but he comments that Jack really is a sewer rat if he's relying on luck this late in the Duel. Jack retorts that he's not relying on luck, as Duels are a shot at endless possibility, a moment-by-moment Big Bang. Jack is the King, one who is resented, hated and envied by every Turbo Duelist. As long as he keeps riding, the Duel will keep accelerating. Goodwin calls it nonsense; "Drago Ascension" and its 12000 ATK are staring him in the face, and there's no way that Jack can turn this Duel around. Jack claims that he'll show Goodwin a Big Bang that will and he draws, declaring that it is the possibility of a King.
 He's drawn " Champion's Storm ," which allows him to prevent "Red Dragon's" destruction and inflict the same damage to Goodwin. Goodwin wonders in shock if Jack is planning to make this a  Sense  battle. Both Duelists prepare for the Sense battle, Jack declaring his absolute Sense, Sense Banishment, while Goodwin declares his Shadow Sense, Brutal Annihilation, Sense of Doom. The two Duel Runners speed past one another and the monsters clash, the resulting explosion destroying the segment of the track that they're on. Goodwin's Duel Runner is destroyed, and he weakly protests that it can't be and that Jack can't have. Goodwin's ambition, 5000 years... He reaches futilely into the air as his Life Points fall to zero, before passing out of sight entirely. Jack too is falling, the Phoenix Whirlwind still intact, claiming that there's only room for one at the top, and that he is Jack Atlas, the King of Turbo Duels. Part of his Duel Runner explodes as he falls over the gap in the track and his Life Points fall to zero. 
 Down below in  Satellite ,  Kalin  watches the Turbo Duelists' battle energy transforming into rays of light, fuel for the  Ultimate God 's resurrection, and he mutters Jack's name worriedly. Meanwhile, at the altar where  Sect Injuin  Dueled  Akiza ,  Crow  has released the captive  D1 Grand Prix  Duelists, as well as  Mei ,  Sakura  and  Ran Kobayakawa  from the  cards  that  Lazar  had sealed them into. Lazar himself is bound on the ground, and Crow warns him that he's still got questions for him. Lazar is furious at the "nobody's" actions.  Leo  and  Luna  approach the group, and Crow sneakily asks Leo if he came to settle their score from the boat. Leo quickly hides behind his sister and apologizes to Crow. Luna tells him to man up with no excuses, and he sheepishly agrees. Crow sweatdrops at seeing a crybaby brother and practical little sister as opposed to the children he was familiar with, noting their change. Luna asks where  Yusei  is, but  Grieger  points out the energy coming from  Aerial Fortress Seibal . Giggling, Lazar explains that the light is energy, being channeled into the top of Seibal, to the tower where the Ultimate God slumbers. He tells the nobodies to struggle all they want, but it's too late. Crow grabs him by the lapels, asking when they asked Lazar to explain. The twins look worried for Yusei.
 In the corridor of the Southern Sky, Yusei has 2600 Life Points, two Set cards, and " Seven Swords Warrior " armed with  an Equip Spell  that has boosted its ATK to 2600, while the  Skeleton Knight  has 3300 Life Points and his " Underworld Dragon Dragonecro " in play, along with a Set card and a  Continuous Spell Card . Telling Yusei to get ready, the Knight attacks "Seven Swords Warrior" with "Dragonecro," ordering it to suck out the soul of the next servant. Yusei opens a Set card, " Barrier Blade ," to negate the attack and inflict 800 damage to the Skeleton Knight's Life Points. In response, the Knight uses his " Phantom Effect "  Trap Card  to negate the damage and then create "Phantom Tokens" with  ATK  equal to the damage that was negated. Yusei remembers the Tokens from his last Duel with the Knight, as the Knight reminds him that the Tokens can attack Yusei directly. But "Seven Swords Warrior" slashes through the "Phantom Tokens" and Yusei smiles, explaining that he saw the move coming. He's equipped "Seven Swords Warrior" with " Sacred Sword Thanatos ," which destroys  Token Monsters  and takes their power for the monster that wields it. "Seven Swords Warrior" rises to 3400 ATK, surpassing "Dragonecro's" 3000. Recognizing Yusei as the warrior that he'd acknowledged, the Knight ends his turn. Yusei draws, Sets a card, and then he immediately attacks, but the Knight asks if Yusei forgot that there was a Continuous Spell in play, " Hellfire Veil ," which negates the attack. Yusei opens another reverse card, " Assault Cyclone ," negating the effect of one  Spell  or Trap Card and destroying it. He destroys "Hellfire Veil" and removes "Dragonecro's" protection, telling the Skeleton Knight to eat his Sense. "Seven Swords Warrior" slashes "Dragoncero" apart, reducing the Knight to 2900 Life Points

Rex  attacks  " Hot Red Dragon Archfiend " with " Celestial Conquering Dragon Drago Ascension ", but Jack  activates  the  effect  of " Absolute King Back Jack " from his  Graveyard , which he had previously  discarded : by  banishing  it from his Graveyard, Jack  draws  a card, and if it is a  Trap Card , he may activate it immediately. Jack draws and activates " Champion's Storm ",  negating  the  destruction  of his  monster  and inflicting the same  battle damage  he receives to Rex (Jack 500 → 0) (Rex 200 → 0).
