 "The Power Within, Part 1" , known as  "Neos VS Advanced Gem Beasts"  in the Japanese version, is the one hundred and fifty-first episode of the  Yu-Gi-Oh! GX  anime. It first aired in Japan on September 5, 2007 and in the US on July 5, 2008.
 Jaden  finally confronts  Yubel , and  Duels  her in the hopes of freeing  Jesse  from her control.
 
 Summary 
   This summary is currently incomplete. 
 Jaden Yuki  reaches the top of  Yubel 's tower, accompanied by  Syrus Truesdale ,  Ojama Yellow ,  Dr. Crowler  and  Winged Kuriboh . Yubel is waiting for him and is still possessing  Jesse Anderson . Having just absorbed the darkness of heart inside  Adrian Gecko  and recovered her strength, Yubel laughs when questioned about Adrian's  Duel Disk , still on the ground after his defeat. Jaden demands that Yubel release Jesse, but she refuses. This worries Jaden, as if he wins, there's a possibility Jesse would die, but not Yubel. Jaden receives encouragement from the spirits of his monsters, and the  Duel  begins, with Syrus commenting that Jaden has no chance if he still can't use " Polymerization ".
 Jaden draws "Polymerization" on his first turn, and finally brings himself to activate it. When he does, memories of all those he's lost in this conflict come flooding back, but these memories only spurn him onwards and he resolves once more to save Jesse. He Summons " Elemental Hero Flame Wingman ", and attacks, and uses the opportunity to attempt to mentally reach out to Jesse, trying to pierce the darkness around his heart. Unable to find him, he concludes that Jesse's soul was removed from his body, and believes that since Jesse's soul was so powerful, the " Rainbow Dragon " card would be the most likely place for Yubel to have placed it. When Yubel finally Summons " Rainbow Dragon ", Jaden is proven correct, as after a direct attack, he is able to hear Jesse's voice calling him from within it. Jaden promises to save him, but is left with only 300 life-points and no monsters out to do so.
 
 Featured Duel: Jaden Yuki vs. Jesse Anderson 
 Turn 1: Jesse 
Jesse draws " Advanced Dark " and subsequently activates it. Now if Jesse would take  Battle Damage  from a battle involving an Advanced Crystal Beast, he can reduce the Battle Damage he would take to 0 by sending another "Advanced Crystal Beast" from his  Deck  to the  Graveyard . Jesse then  Normal Summons  " Advanced Crystal Beast Cobalt Eagle " (1400/800) in  Attack Position .
 Turn 2: Jaden 
Jaden draws " Polymerization " and subsequently activates it to fuse " Elemental Hero Avian " with " Elemental Hero Burstinatrix " in order to  Fusion Summon  " Elemental Hero Flame Wingman " (2100/1200) in Attack Position.
 "Elemental HERO Flame Wingman" attacks and destroys "Advanced Crystal Beast Cobalt Eagle", but Jesse activates the second effect of "Advanced Dark" by  sending  " Advanced Crystal Beast Emerald Tortoise " from his  Deck  to the  Graveyard . Jesse then activates the last effect of "Advanced Crystal Beast Cobalt Eagle" to place it in his  Spell & Trap Card Zone  as a  Continuous Spell Card . As the monster "Flame Wingman" destroyed did not go to the  Graveyard , the effect of "Flame Wingman" (which would have inflicted  damage  to Jesse equal to the  ATK  of "Advanced Crystal Beast Cobalt Eagle") does not activate. Jaden then  Sets  a card.
 Turn 3: Jesse 
Jesse draws " Advanced Crystal Beast Sapphire Pegasus " and subsequently Normal Summons it (1800/1200) in Attack Position. Jesse then activates the effect of "Advanced Crystal Beast Sapphire Pegasus" to take " Advanced Crystal Beast Ruby Carbuncle " from his Deck and place it in his Spell & Trap Card Zone as a Continuous Spell Card.
 Since "Ruby Carbuncle" is now in the Spell & Trap Card Zone, Jesse activates its first effect to Special Summon itself from the Spell & Trap Card Zone (300/300) in Attack Position. Jesse then activates the second effect of "Ruby Carbuncle" to Special Summon "Cobalt Eagle" from the Spell & Trap Card Zone (1400/800) in Attack Position. Jesse then activates " Crystal Release ", equipping it to "Sapphire Pegasus" and increasing its ATK by 800 ("Sapphire Pegasus": 1800 → 2600/1200).
 "Sapphire Pegasus" attacks and destroys "Flame Wingman" (Jaden 4000 → 3500). "Cobalt Eagle" and "Ruby Carbuncle" then attack  directly  (Jaden 3500 → 2100 → 1800).
 Turn 4: Jaden 
Jaden draws "Neo-Spacian Grand Mole". Jaden's hand contains " Neospace Road " and " Elemental Hero Neos ". Jaden Normal Summons " Neo-Spacian Grand Mole " (900/300) in Attack Position. Since Jesse controls at least three monsters, Jaden activates his face-down " Common Sacrifice " to send the two weakest monsters on Jesse's side of the field ("Cobalt Eagle" and "Ruby Carbuncle") to the Graveyard and  Special Summon  "Elemental Hero Neos" (2500/2000) in Attack Position.
 "Neo-Spacian Grand Mole" attacks "Advanced Crystal Beast Sapphire Pegasus". Jaden then activates the effect of "Grand Mole" to return both battling monsters to their owners' hands. Since "Crystal Release" was sent from the field to the Graveyard, its second effect activates, allowing Jesse to take " Advanced Crystal Beast Amber Mammoth " from his Deck and place it in his  Spell & Trap Card Zone  as a  Continuous Spell Card . "Elemental Hero Neos" attacks directly (Jesse 4000 → 1500). Jaden then sets a card.
 Turn 5: Jesse 
Jesse draws. He then Normal Summons "Advanced Crystal Beast Sapphire Pegasus" (1800/1200) in Attack Position. Jesse then activates the effect of "Sapphire Pegasus" to take " Advanced Crystal Beast Amethyst Cat " from his Deck and place it in his  Spell & Trap Card Zone  as a  Continuous Spell Card . Jesse then activates " Crystal Beacon " to Special Summon " Advanced Crystal Beast Topaz Tiger " from his Deck (1600/1000) in Attack Position (as Jesse has at least two "Crystal Beasts" in his Spell & Trap Card Zone).
 Since there are now seven differently named " Advanced Crystal Beast " monsters on Jesse's field and/or in his Graveyard, he  Special Summons  " Rainbow Dark Dragon " from his hand (4000/0) in Attack Position. "Rainbow Dark Dragon" attacks and destroys "Neos" (Jaden 1800 → 300).
 Duel continues in  the next episode .
