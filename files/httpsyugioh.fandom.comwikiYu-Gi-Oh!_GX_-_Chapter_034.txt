 Summary 
 Jaden Yuki 's " Elemental Hero Terra Firma " attacks and  destroys   Chazz Princeton 's " Light End Dragon ". Jaden  Sets  a card, and Chazz  draws  " Light and Darkness Dragon ". He switches " Dynamite Dragon " to  Defense Position ,  Summons  " Red Wyrm " in Defense Position and Sets a card. Jaden  activates  his  face-down  " Terra Firma Gravity ", forcing all  Level  4 and lower monsters on Chazz's  field  to attack "Terra Firma". "Dynamite Dragon" and "Red Wyrm" attack and are destroyed by "Terra Firma", reducing Chazz to 400  Life Points . This wasn't Jaden's main goal, however, as he correctly guesses that Chazz has just drawn "Light and Darkness Dragon" and would need  Tributes  to Summon it. Chazz tells Jaden not to underestimate him, and activates his face-down " Dragon's Bond ",  Special Summoning  " Wish Dragon " from his  Deck . The effects of "Dynamite Dragon" and "Red Wyrm" activate upon their destruction, and "Terra Firma" loses 300 attack points via the former, and Jaden loses 500 Life Points via the latter.
 Syrus Truesdale , watching on one of the monitors, believes the Jaden has the duel won.  Bastion Misawa  disagrees, believing that if Chazz makes it through Jaden's next turn, he can Summon "Light and Darkness Dragon". Jaden draws, and then activates " Hero's Legacy ", which allows him to draw three cards as he has at least two Level 4 or higher " Elemental Heroes " in his  Graveyard  (" Gaia " and " Absolute Zero "). Chazz activates his face-down " Dragon's Roar ", which will prevent Jaden from attacking, as the only monsters Chazz currently has out are Level 4 and lower  Dragon - Types . Jaden is frustrated, and top it off, none of three cards he's drawn is a monster - instead he's drawn " Alternate Fusion ", " Transcendent Wings " and " Hero's Bond ". He ends his turn, and Chazz Tributes "Wish Dragon" to Special Summon two " Dragon Tokens " via its effect, which he in turn Tributes to Summon "Light and Darkness Dragon". Jaden activates his face-down " Power Shackle ", which  negates  the effects of  Effect Monsters  unless their  controller   pays  500 Life Points to activate them. With Chazz having only 400 Life Points remaining, he can no longer use monster effects. Chazz attacks, and "Terra Firma" is destroyed, with Chazz telling Jaden that "Power Shackle" won't serve his purposes this late in the duel.
 Jaden knows Chazz is right, and he needs to draw a monster, or he'll lose. He draws " Winged Kuriboh ". He Sets a card before Summoning it in Defense Position. Chazz draws, and believes that Jaden's face-down card is "Transcendent Wings". Despite this, Chazz attacks, and is proven correct. Jaden activates "Transcendent Wings", Tributing "Winged Kuriboh" and  discarding  two cards to Special Summon " Winged Kuriboh LV10 " in Attack Position. Jaden pays 500 Life Points to bypass "Power Shackle" and activate its "LV 10's" effect. Chazz activates his face-down " Dragon's Evil Eye ", which destroys "Power Shackle". With it, gone, Chazz can activate "Light and Darkness Dragon's" effect, and he does so, decreasing its attack and defense by 500 to negate "LV10's" effect. "Light and Darkness Dragon" attacks, and Chazz hands Jaden his first loss since arriving at the Academy. He vows to continue to grow stronger alongside  his partner .

"Dynamite Dragon" and "Red Wyrm" are both switched to  Attack Position  and attack "Terra Firma". Both are destroyed (Chazz: 2200 → 400). Chazz activates his face-down " Dragon's Bond ",  Special Summoning  " Wish Dragon " (700/100) from his  Deck  as a Level 4-or-lower Dragon was destroyed this turn.

He pays 500 Life Points to bypass "Power Shackle" and activate the effect of "Winged Kuriboh LV 10" (Jaden: 1100 → 600) [Notes 2] , but Chazz  chains  with his face-down " Dragon's Evil Eye ", destroying "Power Shackle". He then activates the effect of "Light and Darkness Dragon", decreasing its ATK and DEF by 500 ("Light and Darkness Dragon": 2800 → 2300/2300 → 1800) to  negate  the effect of "Winged Kuriboh LV 10". "Light and Darkness Dragon" destroys "Winged Kuriboh LV 10" (Jaden: 600 → 0).

 Notes 
 
 ↑   In the  TCG / OCG , "Light and Darkness Dragon's" effect would activate at this point and negate "Power Shackle" because it has not yet resolved, and the former is already on the field. "Power Shackle" also has no effect preventing other cards from activating in response to it. 
 
 ↑   In the  TCG / OCG , "Winged Kuriboh LV10" Tributes itself as a cost to activate its effect, making it no longer on the field when its effect resolves.
