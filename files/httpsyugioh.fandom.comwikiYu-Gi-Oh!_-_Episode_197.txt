 Summary 
 Leon  manages to gain the upper-hand in the  Duel  and explains that he found consolation in fairy tales when no-one would mind him, and was fascinated by them. He wrote a letter to  Pegasus  and asked him to produce "Fairy-tale-themed" cards.  Yami Yugi  makes a comeback by using " Mirror Force ", but Leon quickly  Special Summons  two of the destroyed monsters. Rebecca remarks that Leon's strategy is strong, and that she is unable to see any flaws on it. Yami Yugi then uses a combo to quickly  Summon  " Dark Magician Girl ", which is one of Leon's favorite monsters. 
 Leon  draws  and activates the  Field Spell Card  given to him by Ziegfried, " Golden Castle of Stromberg ". When he does, his  Duel Disk  frizzles, which catches the attention of  Seto Kaiba ,  Professor Hawkins  and  Solomon Moto . Solomon and the Professor admit knowing about the card, but weren't expecting it to show up in such a place.  Duke  has a hunch, which is confirmed: "Golden Castle of Stromberg" was a single-print rare card made by  Pegasus  for test purposes and prestige only. It was the reward in a tournament (named " Fall Cup Duel Project " in the Japanese version) several years ago, and was never meant to be released or played in tournaments. Seto notes that with the influences of the Schroeder family, getting it must've been easy.  Mokuba  adds that, since the card holds such a status, the "Solid Vision System" should have never accepted it. However, he realizes something, which Seto confirms: the Duel Computer Limiter has been tampered with so that it's recognized as a legal card. Kaiba demands to know if that was Zigfried's true goal, which Zigfried responds to by shrugging. Zigfried smugly thinks to himself that Kaiba can't escape his trap.
 After finding out his card is illegal, Leon looks unsure. Zigfried tries to assure him by claiming that, since the card is on the field, it's now legal and winning is what matters for their family. Yami Yugi accuses Zigfried of staining both the Duel and the "souls of us Duelists", saying he doesn't have the qualification to be a Duelist. Zigfried disregards the accusation, seeing Duel Monsters as being a mere game. Yami Yugi claims that he's stained the sanctity of the entire tournament: the Duelists who took part in this tournament and everyone who came to cheer, the fans of Duels scattered around the world and the heart of Leon, who was fighting for his sake. Zigfried sees it as "playing the hero" and tells Yami Yugi that he's "not mature enough".
 Leon tells Zigfried that it would seem he doesn't believe in him after all, and that's why he's doing this. Leon refuses to play foul, so he activates " Mystical Space Typhoon " to destroy "Golden Castle of Stromberg", only to learn that the card cannot be destroyed by Spell or Trap Cards. Solomon and the Professor catch on: the card's text data has been rewritten. Suddenly, a nearby TV screen frizzles. Zigfried asks Kaiba to remove the limiter if he thinks it really bothers him so much, as the card itself is a switch. Upon its activation, a virus program is engaged.
 Kaiba orders from the anti-virus program to be engaged, but Zigfried deems it to be too late: all programs will be erased at a great speed, and all of the Duel monsters data will be gone. Leon, taken aback, tries to surrender the Duel, but Zigfried claims that it won't halt the virus. There's only one way to stop it: destroy the Golden Castle! Yami Yugi encourages Leon to continue on, and he promises to find a way to destroy it. He rallies for him to show Zigfried "the glory of Duelists" and claims that they'll get rid of this infamous trap.

Three turns after the activation of "Spinning Wheel Spindle", "Queen's Knight" will be returned to Yami Yugi's side of the field.

Leon then activates " Water of Life " to revive "Iron Hans" (1200/800) in Attack Position. The effect of "Iron Hans" then activates, Special Summoning one "Iron Knight" from Leon's Deck (1700 → 700/700) in Attack Position.
 Turn 8: Yami Yugi 
Yami Yugi draws " Pot of Greed " (Yugi's Deck: 32 → 31) and subsequently activates it to draw two cards (Yugi's Deck: 31 → 29).

 Turn 9: Leon von Schroeder 
Leon draws "Pot of Greed" and subsequently activates it to draw two cards. He then switches "Iron Hans" to Defense Position. Leon then activates " Golden Castle of Stromberg ". Leon then activates the first effect of "Golden Castle of Stromberg" to Special Summon " Cinderella " from his Deck (300/600) in Attack Position.

 "Cinderella" attacks directly via the effect of "Pumpkin Carriage" (Yami 2500 → 2200). Since "Cinderella" inflicted Battle Damage through a direct attack, the first effect of "Glass Slippers" activates, equipping itself to Yami Yugi's "Dark Magician Girl" and decreasing its  ATK  by 1000 ("Dark Magician Girl": 2000 → 1000/1700). Upon discovering that "Golden Castle of Stromberg" is an illegal card that  his brother  made legal through hacking, Leon activates " Mystical Space Typhoon " to destroy it. However, the fifth effect of "Golden Castle of Stromberg" prevents its destruction by other card effects.
 Duel concludes next episode. 
 
 Differences in adaptations 
 A shot of the arrow of " Forest Hunter " flying past  Yami Yugi  is cut from the dub. 
 The writing in  Leon 's fairytale books is obscured in the dub. 
 In the dub, the spindle is obscured when it hits " Queen's Knight ". 
 In the original, the attack of " Dark Magician Girl " on " Iron Knight " blasted a hole right through the latter monster. In the dub, the hole is slightly obscured. 
 In the original, Yami Yugi makes a speech about Duelists that have fought in Duels and the Duelists that have come to support the Duelists currently Dueling. This is removed from the dub. 
 Errors 
 When Zigfried admits that the "Golden Castle of Stromberg" is an illegal card, the Dueling field is shown in a wide-shot, and "Dark Magician Girl" is still shown to be wearing her usual blue boots instead of "Glass Slippers". 
 In this episode, it's revealed that illegal cards can't be recognized by KaibaCorp Duel Disks; however, in the Japanese version,  Seeker  used fake " Exodia " cards in the Battle City Arc with no issues. The Japanese version also states that many of the cards  Marik Ishtar  and  Odion  gave  Joey Wheeler  were illegal, but they activated anyway.
