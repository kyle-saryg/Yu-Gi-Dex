 Breo's Turbo Deck is  a  Bicorn / Beast  Deck  focused on  milling  the opponent's Deck in order to win. His Deck is spearheaded by " Voltic Bicorn ". He also uses a large array of  Trap Cards  to  negate  his opponent's moves so that he can freely go about with his strategy without worrying about taking damage.
