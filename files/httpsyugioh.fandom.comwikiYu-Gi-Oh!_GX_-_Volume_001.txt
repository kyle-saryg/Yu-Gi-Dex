 Message from Kazuki Takahashi 
 Kageyama, one of my assistants, is going to do a manga for "Yu-Gi-Oh! GX", which was initially created as an anime. He'll put a real personal touch into the work, so please look forward to the adventures of Jaden and his friends in the new "GX"! [2] 
 
 Message from Naoyuki Kageyama 
 I never imagined I'd do a "GX" series. This version will be very different from the anime. It's better if you look at it as something completely separate. I'll do my best to live up to your expectations! [2]
