 The  Master Rules  (Japanese: マスタールール  Masutā Rūru ) are a series of card rules that were applied in the  OCG  at the beginning of  Yu-Gi-Oh! 5D's . The Master Rules codify the rules along with some well-known Dueling terms. In the  TCG , rule changes don't have formal names like they do in the  OCG .

 New Master Rules 
 The  New Master Rules , known as "Master Rules 4" in Asian-English, came into effect in the  OCG  with the release of  Starter Deck 2017 [4] [5]  and in the  TCG  with the equivalent  Starter Deck: Link Strike .
 
 Introduced  Link Monsters ,  Link Markers ,  Link Summons  and  Linked States . 
 Changed the layout of the  playing field .
 The  Pendulum Zones  were moved into the  Spell & Trap Zones . 
 The existing  Monster Zones  were classified as  Main Monster Zones . 
 2 new Monster Zones, the  Extra Monster Zones , were introduced, located in the 2nd and 4th  columns  between the 2 sides of the field, and are exclusively used for the Summoning of monsters from the  Extra Deck .
 While an Extra Monster Zone is unoccupied, it does not belong to either player's field. 
 Monsters Special Summoned from the Extra Deck must be Summoned to either an Extra Monster Zone or a Main Monster Zone a Link Monster  points to . 
 Master Rules 2020/2021 
 These rules take place starting from April 1, 2020 (OCG), November 24, 2021 (TCG). [6] [7] [8] 
 
 Fusion ,  Synchro  and  Xyz Monsters  may be  Special Summoned  from the  Extra Deck  directly to  Main Monster Zones .
 They may also be Summoned to  Extra Monster Zone , at the player's decision. 
 This rule  does not  apply to Link and Pendulum Monsters, however, they still have to follow the old rule.  
 This specific rule was in effect in TCG from April 1, 2020. 
 Unless it is specifically referenced in the text, monsters that are returned to the Extra Deck face-down cannot activate their effects (this includes mandatory effects).
 This means that sending a card with an effect that triggers when it "leaves the field" back to the Extra Deck face down does not trigger their effect. 
 Do note that cards returned to the Main Deck already  cannot  activate those effects before the rule change (regardless of region). 
 In card texts, cards refer to their effect activation requirement as well as their effect activation location. (For example, if it is an effect that activates when the monster itself is Normal Summoned, it activates on the field, if it is a Trap Card whose effect is activated if it is sent to the GY, it activates in the GY.) If a card moves location from its activation location to a different location before its effect activated, its effect cannot be activated (including mandatory effects).
 If a card is being sent to the Graveyard and has an effect that activates when being sent to the Graveyard, but it is then removed from the Graveyard as part of a chain before its effect's activation then it can no longer activate nor resolve. 
 Cards with text such as “During the turn you activate this effect, you cannot Special Summon monsters, except [blank] monsters” or “During the turn you activate this card, you cannot Summon monsters, except with this card’s effect”, which have activation requirements for whether or not you Summoned certain monsters during the turn, will now check whether or not the Summoning of the monster described in the text was successful for their activation requirements.
 This means that even if a Summon that would violate this condition was negated prior in the turn, a card with one of the above effects can still be played, whereas prior to this rule change, it would still not be considered a valid play that turn. 
 Cards with effects such as "You can only Special Summon [blank] once per turn” now only apply if the Summon was successful. 
 Continuous Trap cards that Special Summon themselves to the Monster Zone by their own effects now also do not occupy a Spell/Trap Zone (But they are still treated as Trap cards).
