 Previously Official Rulings 
   These TCG rulings were issued by  Upper Deck Entertainment  and have since been deemed unofficial by Konami. [1]  They were previously considered official and can still be correct, as long as they follow the official gameplay rules, or unless Konami has issued a ruling that says otherwise. References:  [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] 
 
 Even if " 8-Claws Scorpion " is equipped with an  Equip Spell Card , its  ATK  is 2400 when it attacks a face-down Defense Position monster. 
 The effect of " 8-Claws Scorpion " is a  Trigger Effect  that is applied if the condition is correct on activation (" 8-Claws Scorpion " declared an attack against a face-down  Defense Position  monster.) The target monster does not have to be in  face-down   Defense Position  when the effect of " 8-Claws Scorpion " is  resolved . So if " Final Attack Orders " is active, or " Ceasefire " flips the monster  face-up , " 8-Claws Scorpion " still gets its 2400  ATK . 
 The  ATK  of " 8-Claws Scorpion " becomes 2400 during  damage calculation . You cannot chain " Rush Recklessly " or " Blast with Chain " to this effect. If these cards were activated before  damage calculation , then the  ATK  of " 8-Claws Scorpion " becomes 2400 during  damage calculation  so those cards have no effect on its  ATK .
