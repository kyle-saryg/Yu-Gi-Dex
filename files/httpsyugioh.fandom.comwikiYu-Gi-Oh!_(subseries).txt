      Yu-Gi-Oh!  logo     
 Yu-Gi-Oh!  is a subseries of the English  Yu-Gi-Oh!  manga. It occurs prior to the plot shifting to mainly  Duel Monsters -centered storylines.
 It covers  chapters 1  to  59  of the manga, which are compiled in  volumes 1  to  7 . After this, numbering in the English manga was reset to 1 and the series continued as  Yu-Gi-Oh! Duelist ; the Japanese version did not reset numbering or split the series into subseries.
 It contains the " Trial of the Mind ", " Death-T " and " Monster World " arcs and a number of standalone chapters, almost all of which each contain a different game.
