Umm....does anybody know a site where i can download these volumes from? Or at least read them? -- Montechristo95  13:28, June 4, 2010 (UTC)
 
 Downloading them is illegal, unless it's authorised by the copyright holders. If they're not sold anywhere near where you live, they can be bought online at  amazon.com . --  Deltaneos  ( talk ) 14:46, June 4, 2010 (UTC) 
 I know it's illegal. Maybe downloading them was a bad idea. I found a site where I can (only) read most of them and I'm fine for the moment. Thanks for the link though... -- Montechristo95  20:34, June 4, 2010 (UTC) 
 Actually, reading them online is illegal too, unless they are uploaded (or authorized) by the copyright holder. Fortunately, though, most manga/anime licensors are generally much cooler about this stuff than, say, the RIAA. It'd just be nice if more people who illegally read/watch/download anime and manga would actually support the licensors, but what can I do? =P [/rant]  「 ダイノ ガイ 千？！ 」 ?  ·  Talk⇒Dinoguy1000  00:31, June 5, 2010 (UTC) 
 Whatever... Now I can't find vol 2 anywhere and i'm getting sick of searching. I guess the admins will get mad if someone posts a link to read or download them here so if anybody has a clue, please send me a personal message. kay thanks! -- Montechristo95  10:11, June 5, 2010 (UTC) 
 I would suggest searching for chapters instead of volumes. At the same time, it's possible the scanslation groups dropped this series after the first volume (in which case you're SOL unless you can find raws and read Japanese); I have no idea.  「 ダイノ ガイ 千？！ 」 ?  ·  Talk⇒Dinoguy1000  02:01, June 6, 2010 (UTC) 
 Actually i found the volumes i was looking for. Some guy here at the wiki told me a really good site which appears to have them all. I won't tell the guy's name in case he doesn't want me to and i won't mention the link here coz im not sure if it's ok with the wikia's policy to do that. If you want the site then visit my talk page  here . And btw i don't read japanese (unfortunately)  -- Montechristo95  13:42, June 6, 2010 (UTC) 
 Aah, yes, that site. I actually briefly considered suggesting it to you. I'll have to look at the forums there myself to see what he was talking about. =)  「 ダイノ ガイ 千？！ 」 ?  ·  Talk⇒Dinoguy1000  18:39, June 6, 2010 (UTC) 
 Yeah i consider doing that also. I mean what could be so bad abt it? Anyway thanks for the interest you showed in my question. I really appreciate it. -- Montechristo95  21:01, June 6, 2010 (UTC) 
 No problem. =)  「 ダイノ ガイ 千？！ 」 ?  ·  Talk⇒Dinoguy1000  18:40, June 7, 2010 (UTC)
