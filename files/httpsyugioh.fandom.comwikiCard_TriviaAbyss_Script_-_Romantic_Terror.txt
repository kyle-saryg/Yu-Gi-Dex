 " Abyss Actor - Superstar " and " Abyss Actor - Leading Lady " appear in this card's artwork. 
 This card's artwork is based on Shakespeare's "Romeo and Juliet".
 Despite this card's artwork showing a balcony, there was never a balcony in said play, but a window. "Romeo and Juliet" plays began using them due to the popularity of Thomas Otway's "The History and Fall of Caius Marius", which took influence from the Shakespeare work. 
 This card is currently the only " Abyss Script " card not based on one used in the anime.
