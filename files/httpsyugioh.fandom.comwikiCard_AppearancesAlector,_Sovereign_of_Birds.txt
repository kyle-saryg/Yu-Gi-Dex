 Yu-Gi-Oh! 5D's 
 In  episode 80 , this card was used as part of a Duel Puzzle that  Crow Hogan ,  Jack Atlas ,  Yusei Fudo  and  Bruno  had to solve in order to find out who stole Yusei's program. On Bruno's attempt, he activates " Cost Down " to lower this card's Level by two, making it a Level 4 monster. Bruno then activates the effect of " Tragoedia " to send this card from his hand to the Graveyard and take control of " Ancient Gear Soldier " (as its effect will prevent " Mirror Force " from activating when "Ancient Gear Soldier" attacks). 
 In  episode 114 , this is seen among the cards used by one of  Crow 's opponents, he faced as  Cup Ramen Man .
