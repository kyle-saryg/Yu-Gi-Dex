 " Clean-Up Operation ", known in Japan as " The Man Who Washes Duels " is the sixteenth episode of the  Yu-Gi-Oh! SEVENS  anime. It aired in Japan on September 19, 2020.
 As they chase after the fake  Kaizo ,  Yuga  and co. arrive at the  A.I. Restaurant ! Thanks to  Luke  forgetting their goal and overeating, they now have to wash the dishes.  Romin  then falls into a trap set by  Arata Arai , the leader of the  Washing Club  at  Goha 3rd Elementary . If she loses to him in a  Rush Duel , she must continue washing dishes for free...
 
 Featured Duel: Romin Kassidy vs. Arata Arai 
 The Duel is conducted as a  Rush Duel .
 Turn 1: Romin Romin Normal Summons " Elengel " (500/800) and " Eleckiss " (300/1000), then tributes them to Tribute Summon " Prima Guitarna of the Colorful Light " (2200/0). Romin sets 2 cards.
 Turn 2: Arai Arai sets a card, then uses a cheating mechanism to swap his set card with " White Foam - Bleach Motor ". He then activates his set "Bleach Motor", letting him target 1 Level 7 or higher monster Romin controls and lower its ATK by 500 as well as inflict 500 damage to Romin. He targets "Prima Guitarna" ("Prima Guitarna": 2200 → 1700 ATK) (Romin: 4000 → 3500 LP). Arai Normal Summons " Washing Musketeer Washooter " (0/800). Since Romin controls a Level 7 or higher monster, the effect of "Washooter" lets Arai return 1 Spell Card from his GY to his Deck and draw a card. He returns "Bleach Motor" and draws " Seal of the Ancients ". Arai sets "Seal of the Ancients"; then uses the cheating mechanism to swap it with "Bleach Motor". He activates his set "Bleach Motor"; once again targeting "Prima Guitarna" ("Prima Guitarna": 1700 → 1200 ATK) (Romin: 3500 → 3000 LP). Arai Normal Summons another "Washing Musketeer Washooter" (0/800), then activates its effect to return "Bleach Motor" to his Deck and draw " Piercing! ". He sets "Piercing!", then uses the cheating mechanism to swap it with "Bleach Motor". He activates his set "Bleach Motor", again targeting "Prima Guitarna" ("Prima Guitarna": 1200 → 700 ATK) (Romin: 3000 → 2500 LP). 
 Arai tributes his two copies of "Washooter" to Tribute Summon " Clean Beret - Colonel Mop " (2300/1200). Arai sets a card. At this point,  Luke  uses his power to disable the cheating function of Arai's Duel Disk for the rest of the Duel. Arai activates the effect of "Colonel Mop", letting him return 1 Spell Card from his GY to the top of his Deck since Romin controls a Level 7 or higher monster. He chooses "Bleach Motor". "Colonel Mop" attacks and destroys "Prima Guitarna" (Romin: 2500 → 900 LP).  
 Turn 3: Romin Since Romin has no cards in her hand, she draws five cards. Romin Normal Summons "Eleckiss" (300/1000) and " Romance Pick " (500/0). Since she has less LP than Arai, Romin activates the effect of "Romance Pick", paying 500 LP (Romin: 900 → 400 LP) to send the top 3 cards of her Deck to the GY, and if one of those is a  Psychic  monster then she can add a Psychic monster from her GY to her hand. She sends "Elengel", " Psychic Introduction " and " Psychic Divergence " to the GY, then adds "Elengel" to her hand. She then tributes "Eleckiss" and "Romance Pick" to Tribute Summon " Esperaid of the Smashing Light " (2500/0). Since Romin Normal Summoned a Level 5 or higher monster while he controls a Level 7 or higher  WATER  monster, Arai activates his set Trap " Foam Wall - Bubbarrier ", preventing "Esperaid" from attacking directly this turn and negating its effects. Romin activates her set Spell " Self Fan Club ", letting her Special Summon 2 Psychic monsters from her GY to Arai's side of the field and increasing her LP by 1000. She Special Summons "Prima Guitarna" (2200/0) and "Romance Pick" (500/0) to Arai's field in Defense Position (Romin: 400 → 1400 LP).   
 Romin Normal Summons two copies of "Romance Pick" (500/0) and activates both of their effects (Romin: 1400 → 900 → 400 LP), sending " Romic'n'Roller ", "Eleckiss" and "Piercing!" to the GY with the first's effect and "Romic'n'Roller", " Climax Finale " and " Dividing Psychic Wall " with the second's effect. She then adds both copies of "Romic'n'Roller" to her hand. She then tributes both copies of "Romance Pick" to Tribute Summon both copies of "Romic'n'Roller" (1700/0). Since she has 2000 LP or less, she activates the effect of both copies of "Romic'n'Roller", lowering the ATK and DEF of all monsters Arai controls by 500 for each until the end of the turn ("Colonel Mop": 2300/1200 → 1300/200) ("Prima Guitarna": 2200/0 → 1200/0) ("Romance Pick": 500/0 → 0/0). Romin activates her set Spell " Greater Piercing!! ", letting her send 1 card from her hand to the GY to allow 2 monsters she controls with the same Level to inflict piercing damage this turn. She sends "Elengel" to the GY and targets the 2 copies of "Romic'n'Roller".  
 Both copies of "Romic'n'Roller" attack and destroy "Romance Pick" and "Prima Guitarna" (Arai: 4000 → 2300 → 600 LP). "Esperaid" attacks and destroys "Colonel Mop" (Arai: 600 → 0 LP).
