 Biography 
 This man held hostages at  Heartland Shopping Mall  and demanded money and a helicopter in order to release them. He kicked a  litterbot  as a message. When  Astral  noticed he had a " Number ",  Yuma  went to try to get it, but  Kite Tenjo  appeared and  Orbital 7  stopped time. He had no other choice then but to Duel Kite. As Kite easily Summoned his " Galaxy-Eyes Photon Dragon ", his " Number 56: Gold Rat " was defeated and he lost the Duel. When Kite used his  Photon Hand  to claim the "Gold Rat" card, he aged very fast as his soul was taken in process. When Yuma and Astral arrived, they found out it was too late and the "Number" was already taken. The criminal then said " Number Hunter ..." several times in attempt to warn Yuma before time returned to normal. [1]
