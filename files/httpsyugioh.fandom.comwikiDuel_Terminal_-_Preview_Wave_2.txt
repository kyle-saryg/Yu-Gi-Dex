 There were working Duel Terminals at the Comic Con in August, giving out English Duel Terminal cards, at the official Konami Booth. They only included the original reprints from the  OCG  set.
 There is no difference between the contents of this set and  Duel Terminal - Preview Wave 1 , except with some changed rarities and the addition of cards with Set Numbers DTP1-EN021 through DTP1-EN031.

" Ally of Justice Catastor " is the only new card in this set, and it was set as  Illegal  upon this set's release, since Duel Terminal machines had a limited distribution. However, the card is now legal because of its release in  Hidden Arsenal , a more widely-distributed product.
