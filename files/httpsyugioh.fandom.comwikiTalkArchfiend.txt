I have some questions.
 I've heard from someone in my school that all archfiend monster cards cost life points to keep on the field per turn. What I'm wondering is: 
 1. Is it true, and if so how much also is it per card or in general?
 3. Does it only apply to monsters or does it also apply to the spell and trap cards that are Archfiends (for example Axe of despair)?

 The only Archfiends that make you pay LP say so in their text. If it doesn't say anything about it in the card's text, then you don't have to pay any Life Points.  Bluedog187  21:20, 26 July 2008 (UTC) 
 and you cant use skill drain to stop he effect of the life point paying (which kinda sucks but anyways) Llyon werewolf  22:48, 11 January 2009 (UTC)
 Look at individual Archfiend  monster  cards to check out what costs you have to pay, but remember that the key is  Pandemonium , because it negates all monster costs!  However, the theme is still paying costs, because cards like  Archfiend's Roar  have costs and  Falling Down  deals you damage (not considered a cost, but you still lose life points!).  Archfiends are pretty powerful, even if by the time you've thrashed your opposition you only have 1200 life points left, which is normally how I manage.  Clorth  18:40, December 18, 2009 (UTC)

 Prime Material Dragon? 
 As much as I dispise this broken excuse of a card, if used with chess Archfiends, do I win Life Points equal to their cost? Or costs are not considered as damage?
 
 Prime Material heals damage, not costs that must payed.quoted by Doomed Lucid from - .?-- 112.202.127.29  05:15, 26 July 2009 (UTC) 
 
 
 Is it an Archfiend? 
 Hey, is  Infernal Incinerator  and  Regenerating Rose  considered as 
 Archfiends  becuase they have  Demon  in they're names.?-- 112.202.127.29  05:15, 26 July 2009 (UTC)
 
 Those monsters are not Archfiends, because the Japanese spelling of the word " Demon " is different from those that are classified as " Archfiends ".  Messengerofthedark  06:03, 26 July 2009 (UTC)
 
 Is  Summoned Skull  (and toon summoned skull) an  Archfiend ?  Clorth  11:26, January 6, 2010 (UTC)
 Yes, yes they do. I remember Konami having a page somewhere telling you what old cards were considered archfiends.  205.127.241.18  ( talk ) 21:00, May 9, 2011 (UTC)DoomedLucid
 
 Falling Down 
 Would the damage taken from this card be excused by Pandemonium?

 "during the Standby Phase for "Archfiend" monsters"  Falling Down  is not a monster, so you must still pay Resk  11:16, November 6, 2009 (UTC) 
 Neither is it an "Archfiend" and " Pandemonium " only prevents you from  paying  Life Points. With " Falling Down " you are taking damage not paying a  cost . --  Deltaneos  ( talk ) 11:25, November 6, 2009 (UTC) 
 -Awesome deck- 
 Sweet deck idea. I made an archfiend deck like it. It turned out pretty well; though i added some good fiends like  helpoemer ,  Viser Des ,  Summoned Skulll  and  Goblin King . Also, i recommend loading the deck with cards like monster reborn for attacking all at once.-- Knightkmirror  02:48, April 2, 2010 (UTC) Knightkmirror
