 いまはじまるのさ

この想い　タ・ギ・レ！ 
 
戦う準備はできている 
震える胸耳を済まして 
ずっとそのときを待っている 
負けることもあったけど 
そのたびにまた立ち上がれた 
また強くなれた

 It's beginning now 
The story I've been always picturing in my heart 
As these feelings BOIL UP inside me! 
 
All preparations for battle are ready 
The whispers of my heart tremble inside my chest 
I've always been waiting for that moment 
 
And although I may lose 
I'll then stand up again 
As I keep stronger 
 
Let's believe it 
More than ever before, 
the "now" is just another limit 
Which I will cross through 
 
It's beginning now 
The story I've been always picturing in my heart 
As these feelings BOIL UP inside me! 
 
I've got in my hands 
A powerful trump card 
 
My unbreakable heart - which with I'll chase my dream!

 It's beginning now 
The story I've been always picturing in my heart 
As these feelings BOIL UP inside me! 
 
All preparations for battle are ready 
The whispers of my heart tremble inside my chest 
I've always been waiting for that moment 
 
And although I may lose 
I'll then stand up again 
As I keep stronger 
 
Let's believe it 
More than ever before, 
the "now" is just another limit 
Which I will cross through 
 
It's beginning now 
The story I've been always picturing in my heart 
As these feelings BOIL UP inside me! 
 
I've got in my hands 
A powerful trump card 
My unbreakable heart - which with I'll chase my dream! 
 
I keep hitting the wall over and over 
Tears even fall down over my cheeks 
But I can't wake up from this dream 
 
And I've even reached the very bottom 
But I still could laugh then 
Because you were there 
 
Keep on my side 
And so, "now" and even after now 
The Goddess of victory will smile upon me 
 
Let's fight now 
Even if I'm hit, my SPIRIT will stand firm 
As this POWER BOILS UP inside me! 
 
And then 
No matter what difficult and painful trials await me 
I won't be crushed, and I'll wipe away my tears! 
 
I won't stop anymore 
I'll START repainting anything and everything 
As my life burns up! 
 
It's beginning now 
The story I've been always picturing in my heart 
As these feelings BOIL UP inside me! 
 
I've got in my hands 
A powerful trump card 
 
My unbreakable heart - which with I'll chase my dream!
