 Summary 
 Nash  orders " Chaos Number 107: Neo Galaxy-Eyes Tachyon Dragon " to come forth. The dragon roars and  Yuma  says that all of the " Chaos Over-Hundred Numbers " are on the  field  now.  Astral  addresses Nash, first calling him "Shark" and then correcting himself (All this is cut from the dub; the dub instead created its own recap of the previous episode). Nash brandishes a card, which begins to glow with white light. He tells them both to bare witness to his power, but then corrects himself, saying that this is the true power of all  Seven Barian Emperors  (in the dub, Nash says that if Yuma is up against him, he is against the other Emperors too). He  activates  the  effect  of the " Chaos Xyz Barian Hope " from his  Extra Deck . Yuma is surprised to see a monster effect from that location. Nash explains that when there are three or more "Chaos Over-Hundred Numbers" on the field, he can treat them all as  Level  7 monsters to  Xyz Summon  this card (in the dub, Nash says his card is so powerful it needs all seven of the "Chaos Over-Hundred Numbers" to Summon). Nash  overlays   " Silent Honor DARK ", " Archfiend Seraph ", " Ragnafinity ", "Neo Tachyon", " Masquerade ", " Comet Cestus " and " Giant Red Hand ", chanting "O God of War that embodies  Chaos . This is the origin of my dearest wish. Gather, power of the Seven Emperors!" (omitted from the dub). 
 
       " CXyz Barian Hope " is Summoned.     
 He  Xyz Summons  "Barian Hope" in Attack Position. Yuma's jaw drops and Astral says that card is the true power of the Seven Emperors, while Yuma mutters "Barian Hope" (in the dub, Yuma yells this is bad, while Astral reminds him to keep his guard up). Nash thinks that in the end, he could not protect any of his comrades. As he recites each of their names, their spirit appears in front of one of the  Chaos Overlay Units  of "Barian Hope", while Nash himself stands in front of the center one (in the dub, Nash does not recite his fellow Emperors' names). Though they combined their powers before, they were unable to make their dream a reality.  Tori  asks what's going on and Yuma says that in front of each Chaos Overlay Unit is one of the Seven Emperors. Astral wonders if that monster is really the Seven Barian Emperors themselves (in the dub, Yuma complains that a 7 on 2 Duel isn't fair, while Astral advises him to expect the unexpected to win). Nash declares that this Duel is to make their dreams a reality as each of the spirits dissolves into a beam of light and is absorbed into Nash (in the dub, Nash declares that the Barians will fight together). White waves emanate from Nash, culminating in a storm of pink Barian energy.  Yuma tells Astral that he can feel Shark's fighting spirit. Astral says that's his Chaos (in the dub, Yuma says the storm nearly knocked him off his feet and Astral describes Nash's power as "limitless"). Nash vows that their combined powers will open the way to the Barians' future. 
 
       "Barian Hope" unites  Nash  with the spirits of his comrades.     
 Nash tells Yuma and Astral that this is the end. He reveals the effect of "Barian Hope" - its  ATK  is equal to the number of Overlay Units it has times 1000. Yuma is shocked to see 7000 ATK, but Astral tells him to activate his  Trap . Yuma does so, revealing his  face-down  " Overlay Assistance ", He explains when he has no  hand , he can activate this when his opponent  Special Summons  an  Xyz Monster . It will let him  draw a card  for each Overlay Unit the monster has. Therefore, he draws seven cards. Nash is nonplussed and activates another effect of "Barian Hope" - by  detaching  an Overlay Unit or  paying  400  Life Points , he can use the effects of the "Chaos Over-Hundred Numbers"  attached  to "Barian Hope" as Overlay Units. Yuma recalls the effects of each of them, worried that this card can use them all (in the dub, Yuma adds that it's almost impossible to take down even one of the "Over-Hundred Chaos Numbers"). Astral wonders if they'll even be able to survive this  turn . Nash clarifies that he cannot use the same effect more than once per turn, though. Astral is still worried. Nash declares that this is the true bond of the Seven Emperors and the spirits of the others reappear in front of their respective Overlay Units. 
 
       Marin 's spirit joins Nash as they declare the effect of " Number C103: Ragnafinity ".     
 Nash is shocked by pink lightning bolts as he declares he's paying 400 Life Points. A spectral form of "Neo Tachyon" appears behind "Barian Hope" as he activates the effect of the former monster.  Mizar 's spirit appears alongside Nash and recites the effect with him - once per turn, it can  negate  the effects of all other cards on the field and return the game state to how it was at the beginning of this turn. They finish by yelling " Time Tyrant !" Rainbow energy covers the field as the effects of " Number 39: Utopia " are negated, "Overlay Assistance" is re- Set  to Yuma's field and another card reappears on Nash's field. Nash adds that Yuma can't activate cards without his permission. Nash is shocked by more bolts as he pays 400 Life Points and a spectral form of "Archfiend Seraph" appears behind "Barian Hope".  Dumon 's spirit recites its effect alongside it - the ATK of a monster on the field becomes 0. "Utopia" is shocked by pink energy, while Nash and Dumon states the hopes they cling to will be scattered like flowers (this line is removed from the dub). "Utopia" drops its swords as its ATK falls to 0 and groans, holding its arm in pain. Nash grunts as he's electrified again, paying 400 Life Points to activate the effect of "Ragnafinity", whose spectral form appears behind "Barian Hope".  Marin 's spirit appears with him and they explain that when the ATK of an opponent's monster has changed, the difference between the current and former ATK can be inflicted as  damage . Nash says that the ATK of "Utopia" has changed by 2500 and adds that "Neo Tachyon" prevents them from activating any effects on the field - so this is the end. 
 
         Alito 's spirit with Nash as the effect of " Number C105: Battlin' Boxer Comet Cestus " is activated.     
 Waves of red energy flash over Yuma and Astral, but Yuma claims there's not a chance of this being the end. He activates " Ant Barrier " from his hand via its own effect. He can do so to negate effect damage from an opponent's monster. He adds that it also switches a monster he controls to  Defense Position  and negates one attack per turn. "Utopia" switches to Defense Position and "Barian Hope" is wrapped in chains. Nash mutters "a trap from the hand", saying that's the only chink in the armor of "Neo Tachyon". Nash declares he's not done yet though (in the dub, Nash calls Yuma's belief he outsmarted Nash "cute" saying Yuma CAN'T outsmart him). He grunts in pain as he pays 400 Life Points to activate the effect of "Giant Red Hand", whose spectral form appears behind "Barian Hope".  Girag 's spirit appears with Nash and they explain that this can negate the effects of all other face-up cards on the field (in the dub, Nash explains the effect by saying that "Giant Red Hand" will smash Yuma's "Ant Barrier" to pieces). Yuma yells "WHAT!" as "Barian Hope" breaks the chains that bind it, since "Ant Barrier" is now negated. Nash then pays another 400 Life Points to activate the effect of "Comet Cestus", whose spectral form appears behind "Barian Hope".  Alito 's spirit appears and they explain that once per turn, they can destroy an opponent's monster. They declare "Eat this, "Utopia!" (""Barian Hope" automatically KOes your "Utopia!"" in the dub) "Barian Hope" swats at "Utopia" with its spear a few times, then finishes it off with a thrust to the chest. Yuma yells "no!", while Nash says this is truly the end now. He orders "Barian Hope" to  attack   directly . "Barian Hope" roars and charges energy in its spear, but Yuma declares that it's not the end yet. He activates the effect of the " Gagaga Guardian " in his hand, explaining that he can do so when a direct attack is declared. "Gagaga Guardian" will be Special Summoned in Defense Position. 
 
         Vector 's spirit puts aside his feud with Nash and unites with him.      Nash yells that he's not done yet and grunts, paying 400 Life Points and reducing him to 1100 (in the dub, he adds that nothing will save Yuma and Astral). The spectral form of "Masquerade" appears behind "Barian Hope" as  Vector 's spirit appears and they explain that "Masquerade" negates the effects of a monster, forces them to  discard  a card and then halves their Life Points. The Summon of "Gagaga Guardian" is negated, so it returns to Yuma's hand, which also contains " Nitwit Outwit ", " Weaker Overlay ", " Damage Reactor ", " Overlay Reborn " and " Rainbow Kuriboh ". Yuma  randomly  discards "Rainbow Kuriboh". The card enters the  Graveyard  portal and an explosion ensues, knocking Yuma and Astral backwards and reducing them to 1200 Life Points. Tori yells both their names and Nash declares that this is the end for real. "Barian Hope" attacks directly. Astral tells Yuma it's coming now, and Nash tells to die before 7000 damage (cut from the dub). Tori says they're finished then and Nash tells them both "farewell". Yuma says that's not the case yet and activates the effect of the "Rainbow Kuriboh" in his Graveyard. When he'd be attacked directly, he can Special Summon it. "Rainbow Kuriboh" erects a rainbow shield, fending off the attack. Nash curses, but orders "Barian Hope" to destroy "Rainbow Kuriboh" instead. It yells "KURI!" as it's destroyed. Astral comments that he has complete control over the effects of all the "Chaos Numbers". Yuma agrees, saying Shark is really, really strong (in the dub, Astral says that no matter what he and Yuma do, Shark is one step ahead of them; Yuma tells him that what matters is they haven't lost yet). Nash compliments them for managing to stop the onslaught of the Seven Emperors (in the dub, Nash tells his opponents that even mutated cockroaches don't live as long as Yuma and Astral do). He activates " Chaos Tempest Draw ". As he controls a " C " monster and 1 or more Spell and Trap Cards, he can  destroy  all Spell & Trap Cards on the field and draw a card for each. "Ant Barrier" and Yuma's Set card are destroyed, as is Nash's Set card. He draws three cards - " Reincarnation of the Seven Emperors ", " Xyz Trip " and " Overlay Menace " - and briefly examines them before Setting all three and ending his turn. 
         Yuma  explains Nash's rationale to  Astral .     
 Yuma sighs and says that was dangerous. Astral agrees, saying it's pretty much a miracle they survived at all. He's confused as to why Nash kept paying his Life Points instead of using the Overlay Units, though. He says he can understand that he wanted to keep the ATK of "Barian Hope" at 7000, but their Life Points are almost even now. Yuma says he knows why - the souls of the other Emperors are in each each Overlay Unit. He explains that he felt it when Nash was attacking. He believes Shark is trying to fight this Duel with the other Emperors by his side. Astral still doesn't seem to get it. Yuma adds that that monster is pretty much the Seven Emperors as one entity - Shark is trying to protect the bonds of friendship. He has taken the power of the people capable of using Chaos the best. Yuma thinks Shark's Chaos is different though - it's as  Enna  said - Chaos is the power to live for others, to protect others. Yuma believes it to be the power of life itself (the power is not named as Chaos in the dub, nor is Enna mentioned).
 Astral asks if he's been keeping control of his real Chaos until now then. That would mean he's only now showing them what Chaos is capable of. Yuma admits it sounds ridiculous. Astral remarks that he still doesn't understand - he has fought to ensure the survival of the  Astral World  - but that means he must destroy the  Barian World . Yuma declares he won't let either of those things happen. He will fight against that. He asks Astral to fight with him. Astral agrees and they both yell " kattobingu " before performing a  ZEXAL Morph . They chant "when the bonds of friendship are one, create the miracle and legend and light" (in the dub, only Yuma chants, "When two kindred spirits unite, their future has no limits!"). They appear now as  ZEXAL III . Nash comments that ZEXAL has arrived then (in the dub, Nash declares that he'll still beat ZEXAL). Nash is suddenly covered in pink energy, while Yuma is covered in yellow energy and a fierce wind picks up. Tori asks what's going on. The energy dissipates and Yuma turns around, now seeing the combined Barian World and  Earth  speeding towards them. He can't believe it - the worlds are going to collide now (in the dub, Yuma asks Astral why it's happening). Astral says the Duel has become more and more intense - perhaps their power is attracting the worlds to one another. Yuma despairs, saying that means no world will survive then as he stares up at the three suns (in the dub, Astral explains that if the collision happens now, all three worlds will be destroyed and that there is high probability of the rest of the galaxy not surviving either).
 
         The worlds begin to collide.     
 Within  Heartland Tower , some survivors have gathered, watching the Duel through a screen. Many of them despair now, believing there's no escape. Among those present are  Cathy ,  Caswell ,  Haru ,  Kari ,  Mr. Kay ,  Jen  and  Summer . Caswell wonders what will become of Earth, while Cathy mutters Yuma's name. Up on a raised platform,  Hart  stands with  Dr. Faker  and  Lillybot . Hart urges everyone to calm themselves, as there is still hope. He says that friends of his are fighting their hardest to make sure they still have a future. He adds that his  big brother  gave up his life to make sure his friends could protect the future. Lily urges the survivors not to give up. Cathy cheers, saying that Yuma is still fighting for them. 
 
         Vetrix  moves with  Kazuma  to stabilize the worlds.     
 Elsewhere on the Barian-Earth,  Vetrix  materializes and calls out to  Kazuma , asking if he can hear him. Kazuma appears in the Astral World and asks if that's really Byron's voice. Vetrix calls him "old friend" and says it's been a long time since they've seen one another. Kazuma thanks Vetrix, saying that his sons helped Yuma grow into a fine young man. Vetrix insists that should've been his line - thanks to Yuma, he got his family back (in the dub, Kazuma remarks that the four boys had their shares of ups and downs, while Vetrix says that there were more downs than ups; the final up erased the damage). Vetrix adds that they have no time for chit-chat though, as there was a crisis barreling down on Yuma, the person that Vetrix's sons put their hopes and dreams on. Kazuma says he knows and Vetrix states that the three worlds are colliding. He suggests they use the last ounce of their strength to help Yuma. Vetrix is covered in a beam of red energy, while Kazuma is covered in blue. They stream towards the arena. Kazuma calls out to Yuma, asking if he can hear him. Yuma yells "Dad?!". Kazuma tells him that they are going to hold off the collision as long as they can. Vetrix declares they'll try their hardest and that this is their destiny (in the dub, Kazuma tells his son that he and Vetrix will show "those punks" what a couple of "old dogs" can do; Vetrix is offended at the remark because of his current young state). Nash looks around, lightly muttering Vetrix's name. Vetrix's  crest  shines out as he disappears behind Yuma and a barrier appears between the arena and the Barian World-Earth merger. Kazuma does the same behind Nash to put up a barrier between the arena and the Astral World, an image of the  Emperor's Key  shining out. Vetrix tells them to continue the Duel, with Kazuma adding that it's the Duel that will decide the future. Tori cheers, saying the two of them stopped the collision. 
 Astral tells Yuma they have to act now. Yuma says he knows and yells "Dad" and "Vetrix". He declares that it's his turn. Yuma and Astral chant, "All of our light. All of our power! That which illuminates the path of hope that dwells in my right hand,  Shining Draw !". He activates "Overlay Reborn", revealing that he can  send  a Level 4 or lower monster from his hand to the Graveyard to Special Summon a  Rank  4 or lower Xyz Monster from his Graveyard. He sends "Gagaga Guardian" to revive "Utopia". He declares that then he detach Overlay Units from an Xyz Monster equal to the Rank of the Summoned monster. This means he can detach four Overlay Units from "Barian Hope". Nash vows not to let that happen and activates his face-down "Overlay Menace", which negates card effects that target Overlay Units. Orange waves of energy wash over "Overlay Reborn". Nash explains that he can also draw a card now and then he gains 500 Life Points for each Overlay Unit he has (in the dub, Nash says he draws seven cards, but only draws one regardless). His Life Points increase to 4600. Yuma grunts, explaining that since "Overlay Reborn" did not detach any Overlay Units, the ATK of the Summoned monster becomes 0. Astral mutters that he even had a way to protect the Overlay Units. 
 
         The other forms of " Number 39: Utopia " appear to merge and create " Number 39: Utopia Beyond ".     
 Yuma declares that they're not done yet and activates " Rank-Up-Magic Astral Force ". Astral declares that this card carries all the hopes and dreams that  Eliphas  had and that it will make them a reality in this Duel - that is why he gave Astral the card before sacrificing himself. Yuma explains that this card targets the monster he controls with the highest Rank. It Special Summons an Xyz Monster whose Rank is one or two higher than it. Yuma declares that this is all of their power and yells, " Rank-Up Xyz Evolution !". "Utopia" re-enters the  Overlay Network  and Yuma tells it to smash through the limits. " Number 39: Utopia Roots ", " Chaos Number 39: Utopia Ray ", " Chaos Number 39: Utopia Ray V " and " Chaos Number 39: Utopia Ray Victory " appear around "Utopia" as Yuma and Astral chant, "When a person embraces a dream that exists beyond hope, a new future appears far off in the distance. Go beyond the limits and seize that future in your own hands!" ("Shatter the boundaries of reality!" in the dub) The five forms raise their swords and a new form manifests, taking pieces from each of them. 
 " Number 39: Utopia Beyond " appears in Attack Position. Yuma orders "Utopia Beyond" to attack, explaining that it is unaffected by the opponent's monster effects. Nash claims it doesn't matter - "Barian Hope" still has more ATK. "Utopia Beyond" flies towards "Barian Hope" and the two trade blows. "Barian Hope" misses with its spear, while the strikes from the swords wielded by "Utopia Beyond" simply rebound off the armor of "Barian Hope". Yuma activates the other effect of "Utopia Beyond". When it  battles , the opposing monster's ATK becomes 0. "Utopia Beyond" fires a blue energy beam at "Barian Hope", dropping its ATK to 0. Nash yells "What!?" and Yuma declares " Rising Sun Beyond Slash ". Nash activates his face-down "Xyz Trip", revealing that when an Xyz Monster he controls is attacked, he can end the  Battle Phase . The thrown swords of "Utopia Beyond" are swatted out of the way by the spear of "Barian Hope". This time, Yuma yells "WHAT!?" and Tori says, "No way..." ("This is intense..." in the dub). Nash clarifies that in order to do so, he has to pay Life Points equal to the attacking monster's ATK - 3000. An explosion detonates at Nash's feet, blasting him back and reducing him to 1600. Yuma mutters that Shark will just keep doing that to protect his comrades, then (in the dub, Shark asks if that's the best Yuma has). He Sets three cards and ends his turn.
 
         Nash tells Yuma and Astral to die (Tells Astral and Yuma that it's Game over in the Dub).     
 Nash declares that he won't lose now and draws. He immediately orders "Barian Hope" to attack with " Land Chariot's Slash ". As two Xyz Monsters are battling, Yuma activates his face-down "Weaker Overlay", which will increase the ATK of the Xyz Monster that has less ATK by 600 for each Overlay Unit more that the stronger monster has. Tori cheers as the ATK of "Utopia Beyond" rises to 7200. Nash says, "Not yet," and pays 400 Life Points to activate the effect of "Ragnafinity". The ATK of "Utopia" changed by 4200, so they'll take that value as damage. Nash's eyes adopt a crazed expression ordering Yuma and Astral to die ("Game over, Yuma." in the dub). Yuma says he won't let him do this and activates his face-down "Damage Reactor". This will negate effect damage and increase the ATK of his monster by 800. "Utopia" absorbs the energy in a flash of blue light and Nash is shocked to see the ATK rise to 8000. Yuma swears to Heaven and Earth that he will keep fighting to make sure tomorrow comes. He yells "shine forth O ray of hope! Rising Sun Beyond Slash!" "Utopia Beyond" bisects "Barian Hope" with its two swords. Tori cheers, while Nash asks why they keep crushing their hopes and dreams. His voice is anguished as he screams both Yuma's and Astral's names and "Barian Hope" explodes (in the dub he says Yuma and Astral will pay for that move).
 
 Featured Duel: Yuma Tsukumo vs. Nash 
 Duel continues from  the previous episode . 
 
         " Neo Tachyon " appears with " CXyz Barian Hope ".     
 Turn 5: Nash 
 Nash  treats the seven " Chaos Over-Hundred Numbers " on the  field  as  Level  7  monsters  and  overlays  them in order to  Xyz Summon  " Chaos Xyz Barian Hope " ( 7/0/0, ORU: 7) in  Attack Position  via its own  effect . Due to the second effect of "Barian Hope", it gains 1000  ATK  for each of its  Chaos Overlay Units  ("Barian Hope": 0 → 7000 ATK). As his opponent Special Summoned an  Xyz Monster ,  Yuma   activates  his  face-down  " Overlay Assistance " to draw seven cards (one for for each Overlay Unit "Barian Hope" has). Nash explains that due to the third effect of "Barian Hope", he can  target  one of its Overlay Units and allow him to either detach it or  pay  400  Life Points  in order to activate that targeted Overlay Unit's monster effect that would be activated by detaching an Overlay Unit(s), however that Overlay Unit cannot be targeted again by this effect for the rest of the turn.
 Through the third effect of "Barian Hope", Nash activates the effect of " Chaos Number 107: Neo Galaxy-Eyes Tachyon Dragon " (Nash: 3500 → 3100 LP) to  negate  the effects of all other cards on the field until the  End Phase  and  return  all cards to the same position they were in at the start of the  turn  as well as prevent Yuma from activating the effects of cards on the field this turn without Nash's permission. Yuma's "Overlay Assistance" is re-Set and another card is re-Set to Nash's field. [Notes 1] 
 
         " Giant Red Hand " appears with "Barian Hope".     
 Through the third effect of "Barian Hope", Nash activates the effect of " Chaos Number 102: Archfiend Seraph " (Nash: 3100 → 2700 LP) to reduce the ATK of "Utopia" to 0 ("Utopia": 2500 → 0 ATK). As the ATK of a monster was changed, Nash, through the third effect of "Barian Hope" (Nash: 2700 → 2300 LP), activates the effect of " Chaos Number 103: Ragnafinity " to inflict  damage  to Yuma equal to the difference between the previous and current ATK of "Utopia", but Yuma activates " Ant Barrier " from his  hand  via its own effect (as a monster effect would inflict damage to him), reducing the damage to 0 and switching "Utopia" to  Defense Position . Yuma explains that while "Ant Barrier" is face-up on the field, he can use its first effect to negate one attack from his opponent per turn. Nash, through the third effect of "Barian Hope" (Nash: 2300 → 1900 LP), activates the effect of " Chaos Number 106: Giant Red Hand " to negate the effects of all other face-up cards on the field. 
 Nash, through the third effect of "Barian Hope" (Nash: 1900 → 1500 LP), activates the effect of " Chaos Number 105: Battlin' Boxer Comet Cestus ", destroying "Utopia" and inflicting damage to Yuma equal to the ATK of "Utopia" on the field. "Barian Hope"  attacks   directly , but Yuma activates the effect of " Gagaga Guardian " (as a direct attack was declared) to  Special Summon  it ( 4/0/2000) in Defense Position. As a monster effect was activated, Nash, through the third effect of "Barian Hope" (Nash: 1500 → 1100 LP) activates the effect of "Umbral Horror Masquerade" to negate the effect of "Gagaga Guardian". Then, Yuma must send a  random  card in his hand to the Graveyard and his Life Points are halved. Yuma's hand contains "Gagaga Guardian", " Nitwit Outwit ", "Weaker Overlay", "Damage Reactor", "Overlay Reborn" and " Rainbow Kuriboh ". The random card sent is "Rainbow Kuriboh" (Yuma: 2400 → 1200 LP). 
 The direct attack continues, but Yuma activates the second effect of "Rainbow Kuriboh" (as a direct attack was declared) to revive it ( 1/100/100) in Defense Position. A  replay  occurs, and "Barian Hope" attacks and destroys "Rainbow Kuriboh". As Nash controls a "C" Xyz monster and a card in his Spell & Trap Zone, he activates " Chaos Tempest Draw " to destroy all  Spell  and  Trap Cards  on the field, and draw three cards (one for each card destroyed this way). Nash draws " Reincarnation of the Seven Emperors ", "Xyz Trip" and "Overlay Menace". Nash Sets all three cards.
 Turn 6: Yuma At this point, Yuma and  Astral  perform a  ZEXAL Morph , overlaying themselves into  ZEXAL III . 
 Yuma then performs a  Shining Draw . He then activates " Overlay Reborn " to send "Gagaga Guardian" (a Level 4 or lower monster) from his hand to the Graveyard and revive "Utopia" ( 4/2500/2000) in Attack Position (as it's a Rank 4 or lower Xyz Monster). Yuma then activates the second effect of "Overlay Reborn" to detach four Overlay Units from "Barian Hope" (the number of Overlay Units that would be detached is equal to the Rank of "Utopia") and attach them to "Utopia". If no Overlay Units are detached through this effect, the ATK and DEF of the Summoned monster become 0 and its effects are negated. As an Overlay Unit attached to an Xyz Monster he controls is being affected by a card effect, Nash activates his face-down " Overlay Menace " to prevent Overlay Units attached to "Barian Hope" from being affected by other card effects until the End Phase, draw one card and gain 500 Life Points for each Overlay Unit attached to "Barian Hope" (Nash: 1100 → 4600 LP) ("Utopia": 2500 → 0/2000 → 0). 
 
         "Barian Hope" trades blows with " Number 39: Utopia Beyond ".     
 Yuma activates " Rank-Up-Magic Astral Force " to  Rank-Up  "Utopia" via  Rank-Up Xyz Evolution  in order to Xyz Summon " Number 39: Utopia Beyond " ( 6/3000/2500, ORU: 1) in Attack Position. "Utopia Beyond" attacks "Barian Hope" and Yuma activates the third effect of "Utopia Beyond" to reduce the ATK of "Barian Hope" to 0 ("Barian Hope": 7000 → 0 ATK) during the  Battle Phase  only. Nash activates his face-down " Xyz Trip " to pay Life Points equal to the ATK of "Utopia Beyond" (Nash: 4600 → 1600 LP) and end the Battle Phase. Yuma Sets three cards.
 
         "Barian Hope" is bisected by "Utopia Beyond".     
 Turn 7: Nash 
Nash draws. "Barian Hope" attacks "Utopia Beyond", but Yuma activates his face-down " Weaker Overlay " (as two Xyz Monsters are  battling ) to increase the ATK of the Xyz Monster that has less Overlay Units by 600 for each Overlay Unit attached to the Xyz Monster that has more ("Utopia Beyond": 3000 → 7200 ATK). Nash, through the third effect of "Barian Hope" (Nash: 1600 → 1200 LP) activates the effect of "Ragnafinity", but Yuma activates his face-down " Damage Reactor " to reduce the damage to 0 and increase the ATK of "Utopia Beyond" by 800 ("Utopia Beyond": 7200 → 8000 ATK). "Utopia Beyond" then destroys "Barian Hope".
 Duel continues in  the next episode .

 Mistakes 
         Incorrect  card backings .     
 As a recurring error, there were a few scenes when the old  card backings  were used instead of the new backings.
 
 Notes 
 
 ↑   The card is presumably " Hundred Summon ", but it is not shown.
