 Biography 
 KaibaCorp 
         Kemo notifies  Gozaubro  of the infection.     
 Kemo worked for  KaibaCorp , while it was managed by  Gozaburo Kaiba . After  Zigfried von Schroeder  infected the  KaibaCorp  mainframe, Kemo notified Gozaburo of the infection. [2] 
 Following a confrontation between  Seto Kaiba  and Gozaburo, over Gozaburo's decision to use Seto's virtual technology for war, Gozaburo had two guards, including Kemo escort Seto out. [3] 
 
 Duelist Kingdom 
         Kemo, during the  Duelist Kingdom  tournament     
 Kemo worked for  Maximillion Pegasus  during the  Duelist Kingdom  tournament. He apprehended Mokuba Kaiba after Mokuba's Duel with  Yami Yugi . Yami then challenged him to a Duel for Mokuba's freedom. Since Kemo did not play, he arranged for  Ghost Kaiba  to Duel Yami. Although Yami won, Kemo still took Mokuba back to Pegasus.
 Some time after Kaiba arrived on the island, Kemo approached him and commented that it had been a while. Kemo held a gun to his head but Kaiba disarmed him using the card, " Gyakutenno Megami ", to jam his gun (this was cut from the dub). Kaiba then forced Kemo to take him to Mokuba's cell. [4] 
 Kemo later acted as the guard at the entrance to Pegasus' castle and attempts to stop  Téa Gardner ,  Tristan Taylor  and  Bakura Ryou  from entering as they were not Duelists.  Mai Valentine  then flirted with him, distracting him long enough for the others to dash in, closing the door behind them.
 
 Legendary Heroes 
 During  Yugi Muto  and  Joey Wheeler 's first stay in the Virtual World, Kemo attempted to break into the room where their bodies were.  Téa Gardner  and  Tristan Taylor  put up a desperate defense to stop them, using furniture to block the door. When everyone awoke after the  Big Five  had been defeated, Kemo fled, leaving himself jobless.
