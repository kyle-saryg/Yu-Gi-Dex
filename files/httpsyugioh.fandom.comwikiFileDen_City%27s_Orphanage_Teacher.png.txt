 Biography 
 The owner first appeared when  Gore's manager  visited the orphanage, where she was watching  Playmaker  and  George Gore 's Duel with the kids. She apologized for the kids' sudden change of support to Playmaker despite Gore's gifts to the orphanage, but the manager didn't mind the children's honesty in supporting the coolest hero. She then expressed the belief that if Gore won, the children would cheer for him again. After Playmaker's attack took half of Gore's  LP  away, she expressed concern for Gore. As Gore  Link Summoned  " Gouki The Great Ogre ", she questioned what happened, with the manager further elaborating on Gore's entertaining style. She then further asked the manager how the Duel would develop. She was pleased to see the children cheering for Gore. [1]  When Gore counterattacked, she felt assured that Gore would win. She was pleased when Gore saved his "Great Ogre" from destruction from the attack of " Decode Talker ". After the duel, she and Gore's manager went to  Gore's warehouse  to applaud Gore after he won back his fans from the orphanage.  [2] 
 She watched  Blue Angel 's duel against  Baira  while at the orphanage with Gore, his manager and the other orphans.  [3] During the rise of the Tower of Hanoi, she watched Gore's duel against  Varis .  [4]
