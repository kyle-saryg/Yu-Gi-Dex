 Biography 
 History 
 Striker is the third son of the infamous Soccer Family and is expected to play soccer like his older brothers,  Dempsey  and  Donovan .  However, despite his great skills, he had little trust in others. During a soccer game, Striker ignored his teammates and tried to win on his own. His brothers disapproved of this and Striker quit soccer. After that, he discovered  Duel Monsters  and began striving to become Duel Champion to overcome his brothers' shadows.
 
 World Duel Carnival 
 Striker is seen with all of the participating  Duelists  as the  World Duel Carnival  is under way. To decide who his first opponent would be, he kicked a soccer ball and whoever it hit would decide who he would Duel. The ball hits  Yuma Tsukumo  and after introductions were out of the way, the two began to Duel. [1] 
 
       Striker watches the finals of the WDC.     
 During his Duel with Yuma, Striker was ruthless in attacking Yuma. Though Yuma kept proclaiming that he and his monsters would win because they work together, something Striker failed to see before.  After losing to Yuma, Striker realized the importance of teamwork and surrendered his  Heart Piece  to Yuma. [2] 
 Striker is next seen with his older brothers among the spectators during Yuma's Duel with  Vetrix  in the final match. [3]
