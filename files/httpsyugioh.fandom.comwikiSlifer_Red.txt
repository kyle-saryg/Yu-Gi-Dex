         The Slifer Red Dorm as seen in  Yu-Gi-Oh! GX .     
 Slifer Red , known as  Osiris Red  (オシリス・レッド  Oshirisu Reddo ) in the Japanese and Castillian Spanish versions, is the lowest-ranked of the three dorms at  Duel Academy . It has also sometimes being referred to as the " Red Dorm ".
 With the exception of a select few, the students in Slifer Red are categorized as being the weakest  Duelists  among the dorms, having weak Decks and poor strategies which cause them to lose most of the time. In some cases, students from this dorm have never won a  Duel  at all and drop out.
 Slifer Red has the worst dorm and the least to no privileges out of the three dorms. Upon seeing it for the first time,  Syrus Truesdale  referred to it as "an outhouse with a deck". Their welcoming feast was a small tray of rice, sardines and sauces held in a small dining hall. The only type of boat they have is a rowboat.  Chazz Princeton  has made the interior of the dorm more luxurious for the students when he moved in. A prominent renovation is the single person living space Chazz added onto the building; it resembles a luxurious apartment (bath included), which includes a living room big enough to hold a party to Pro League duels. During the third year,  Blaire Flannigan  moves into it (to accommodate the fact she is the only girl in Slifer Red), as Chazz had temporarily moved back to  Obelisk Blue . When Blaire moved in, Chazz had the dorm further renovated with a spa that includes a waterfall, a bowling alley in the basement, and a three ring circus in the living room.
 The state of the dorm is likely designed as incentive for residents to either try advancing to a higher dorm and acquire a better standard of living or leaving the school.
 The head of the Slifer Red Dorm, in the anime, was previously Professor  Lyman Banner . After Banner (as Amnael, the 7th  Shadow Rider ) lost a Duel to  Jaden Yuki  his body was destroyed but his cat,  Pharaoh , caught Banner's spirit in his mouth to stop him from leaving. In the  manga  the head of the Slifer Red Dorm is  Midori Hibiki .
 In the beginning of the anime  Dr. Crowler  expressed a great disdain for the students in this dorm, going as far as to set up stakeouts and sabotaging Duels to find any opportunity to expel Slifer students. The students in  Obelisk Blue  shared his dislike and usually exploited the Slifers' low ranks by calling them "drop-out boys" (In the dub this is replaced by terms such as "Slifer Slacker", "Slifer Slime", or "Slifer Scum"). However, as time continued, students from all dorms began flocking to Slifer Red. Examples include  Alexis Rhodes ,  Tyranno Hassleberry ,  Syrus Truesdale  and  Bastion Misawa .
 However, by the end of the series, the only student officially enrolled in Slifer Red appears to be  Jaden Yuki  and has graduated as a Slifer Red student and went on a journey.

 The students wear a jacket that usually extends to the waist. The Jacket has a band which matches the color of the jacket at the cuffs of the arms.  The jacket also has a white band around the shoulders that has a snap or button to keep the jacket closed and another band which also matches the color of the jacket wraps around the bottom of the jacket which also serves the purpose of keeping the jacket closed (although  Jaden Yuki  keeps his open). There is a white decorative shape with a darker red border on the chest of the jacket.
 Some second-year (or higher) Slifer Red students (like  Chumley Huffington ) wear a different colored jacket, a version whose main color is white instead of red. Just like the previous jacket it usually extends to the waist. The jacket has a band which matches the color of the jacket at the cuffs of the arms. The jacket also has a red band around the shoulders that has a snap or button to keep the jacket closed, and another red band that wraps around the bottom of the jacket to keep the jacket closed. There is a decorative shape with a darker red border on the chest of the jacket.
