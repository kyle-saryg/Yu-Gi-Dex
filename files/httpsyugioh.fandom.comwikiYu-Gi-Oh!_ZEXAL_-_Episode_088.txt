 " Dual Duel: Part 2 ", known as " The Pulse of V - A Super-Rebirth, Hope Ray V!! " in the Japanese version, is the eighty-eighth episode of the  Yu-Gi-Oh! ZEXAL  anime. It first aired in Japan on January 27, 2013 and in the United States on November 23, 2013.
 Girag , with the power of the " Barian Sphere Field ", has weakened  Astral . He challenges  Yuma  with  Ray  as his second opponent. However, with the effects of Girag's "Pressure Point" Deck, Utopia is damaged from the inside out, and destroyed. Girag, incapable of controlling his rage and driven to take vengeance for  Alito , Summons his " Chaos Number " and corners Yuma and Ray into the mother of all pinches. At that time, Ray, touched by Yuma's willingness to protect him no matter what the cost, awakens a miracle no one could have ever imagined possible!

 Featured Duel: Yuma Tsukumo and Ray Shadows vs. Girag 
 Duel continues from  the previous episode . 
 Turn 5: Ray 
 
       " Shining Sly " is Summoned.     
 Ray  draws. He then  Normal Summons  " Shining Sly " ( 3/1200/800) in Attack Position. As long as there is an  Xyz Monster  on the  field , the first  effect  of "Shining Sly" will prevent it from being  targeted  for  attacks . Ray  Sets  a card.
 
       Yuma  activates " Swords of Burning Light ".     
 Turn 6: Yuma 
 Yuma  draws. He then Normal Summons " Gogogo Golem " ( 4/1800/1500) in Attack Position. " Number 39: Utopia "  attacks  " Number 106: Giant Hand ", but the last  effect  of "Giant Hand"  activates ,  destroying  "Utopia" and inflicting  damage  to Yuma equal to the destroyed monster's  ATK  (as it was a monster whose effects had previously been  negated  by the effect of "Giant Hand"). As effect damage would be inflicted, Ray activates the second effect of "Shining Sly" to  Tribute  "Gogogo Golem" and reduce the damage Yuma would take to 0 (as he was the controller of "Gogogo Golem"), but Girag activates the effect of "Giant Hand" ("Giant Hand": 1 → 0 ORU) to negate the effects of "Shining Sly" (Yuma: 3400 → 900 LP). 
 Yuma's hand contains "Swords of Burning Light", " Gagagadraw " and " Amarylease ". Yuma activates " Swords of Burning Light ", preventing his opponent's monsters from attacking as long as he controls no monsters. Should Yuma Summon a monster, the card will destroy itself.
 Turn 7 : Girag 
 
         " Number C106: Giant Red Hand " is Summoned.     
 Girag   draws  " Rank-Up-Magic Barian's Force " and subsequently activates it to  Rank-Up  "Giant Hand" via  Chaos Xyz Evolution  in order to  Xyz Summon  " Chaos Number 106: Giant Red Hand " ( 5/2600/2000, ORU: 1) in  Attack Position . Girag activates the effect of "Giant Red Hand" to detach "Giant Hand" ("Giant Red Hand": 1 → 0 ORU) and negate the effects of all other face-up cards on the field. 
 "Giant Red Hand" attacks Yuma  directly , but Ray activates his  face-down  " Shining Stunt " to negate the attack and end the  Battle Phase  as well as inflict damage to himself equal to half the ATK of "Giant Red Hand" (Ray: 1400 → 100 LP). Girag Sets two cards and activates " Erosion Hand Forest ", which will inflict 1000 damage to all players during his  Standby Phase .
 Turn 8 : Ray 
 
         Yuma activates " Desperate Guard ".     
 Ray draws. He then Normal Summons " Shining Rabbit " ( 2/800/400) in Attack Position. He then activates " Shining Bridge " to target "Shining Rabbit" (as it's a " Shining " monster with 1000 or less ATK) and allow it to attack directly this turn. Ray explains that if "Shining Rabbit" inflicts battle damage, he can destroy one  Spell  or  Trap Card  the opponent controls (Ray intends to use the effect of "Shining Rabbit" on "Erosion Hand Forest"). "Shining Rabbit" attacks Girag directly, but Girag activates his face-down " Hand Vice " to negate the attack and inflict damage to Ray equal to the ATK of "Shining Rabbit" (as Girag controls a "Hand" monster). Yuma activates his face-down " Desperate Guard " to reduce the damage Ray takes to 0 by paying half his  Life Points  (Yuma: 900 → 450 LP).
 Turn 9 : Yuma 
 
         " Number C39: Utopia Ray V " is Summoned.     
 After Yuma draws, Girag activates his face-down " Damaging Hand " (as Yuma controls no monsters) to inflict 300 damage to Yuma for every card in his hand. Yuma has three, but Ray activates his face-down " Shining Reborn " to Tribute "Shining Sly" and "Shining Rabbit", send Yuma's entire hand to the Graveyard, revive "Utopia" ( 4/2500/2000) in Attack Position, and Set " Rank-Up-Magic Limited Barian's Force " from his hand to Yuma's field. 
 Yuma activates "Rank-Up-Magic Limited Barian's Force" to Rank-Up "Utopia" via Chaos Xyz Evolution in order to Xyz Summon " Chaos Number 39: Utopia Ray V " ( 5/2600/2000, ORU: 1) in Attack Position. Yuma then activates the effect of "Utopia Ray V" to destroy "Giant Red Hand" and inflict its ATK as damage to Girag by detaching "Utopia" ("Utopia Ray V": 1 → 0 ORU) (Girag: 4000 → 1400 LP). "Utopia Ray V" attacks Girag directly (Girag: 1400 → 0 LP).

 Differences in adaptations 
 In the dub, when  Girag  mentioned how " Number 106: Giant Hand " would  destroy  " Number 39: Utopia ", it looked like " Shining Sly " had already turned " Gogogo Golem " into a wall, this is reversed when the shot of the destruction of "Utopia" ended. 
 The scene where Girag  draws  a card and notices it was " Rank-Up-Magic Barian's Force " is cut from the dub. 
 The scene where Girag felt pain from Summoning " Number C106: Giant Red Hand " is cut from the dub. 
 When  Ray  gives  Yuma  " Rank-Up-Magic Limited Barian's Force ", his mentioning that Ray is a  Barian  and Girag responding that he is a Barian is cut from the dub. 
 In the dub, Ray mentioned it was the effect of " Shining Rabbit " that  Special Summoned  the  Xyz Monster  from the  Graveyard  instead of " Shining Reborn ". 
 Mistakes 
         Ray 's hand with the old  card backings .     
 When  Yuma  and  Ray  Summon " Number C39: Utopia Ray V ", Ray's  hand  shows cards with the old  card backings . This was corrected in the dub.
