 Description 
 One of Marik's nefarious Rare Hunters. Arkana believes he is the one true Master of Magicians. He has no qualms about harming his own cards - as long as it guarantees him a victory. During Battle City, Arkana faced Yami Yugi in a clash of Dark Magicians - where one mistake could lead to an eternity in the Shadow Realm.
 
 History 
 Picking up where the manga left off, Arkana initially believes to have beaten Yugi after waking up alone with no recollection of the conclusion of their duel. Marik's punishment involved 
trying to convince him to commit suicide by stirring up painful memories of his past. Despite the sadness implemented in him from Marik's brainwashing, he resolves to use his persona to mask his true feelings and pursues his own ambitions. Arkana was so elated to have survived that he was able to suppress the pain. Some time later, Arkana entered the world of Duel Links. 
 When Yami Marik returned, Arkana rejoined the Rare Hunters, but was defeated and sent to the Shadow Realm. Arcana was later released once Marik's reign of terror came to an end.

 The Paradox Brothers , Arkana,  Lumis and Umbra ,  Aigami ,  Sera ,,  Prana ,  Jesse Anderson ,  Alexis Rhodes ,  Dr. Vellian Crowler ,  Bastion Misawa ,  Tyranno Hassleberry ,  Sartorius Kumar , and  Blair Flannigan ,  Yusei Fudo ,  Dark Signer Kalin Kessler ,  Kalin Kessler , and  Reginald Kastle  are the Legendary Duelists who have dialogue for cards that are non-existent, unreleased, anime-exclusive, or video game-exclusive. It is uncertain as to why these cards were found in the voice files, or if these said cards will be released in the future.
 Arkana's dialogue for such cards include: " Beckon to Darkness " and " Cursebreaker ".
