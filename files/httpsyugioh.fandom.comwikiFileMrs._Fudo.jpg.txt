 Mrs. Fudo  was  Yusei Fudo's  mother and the wife of  Mr. Fudo .
 Like her husband, she was a lead developer working within  R.R.D. , who was also killed within the  Zero Reverse  disastrous accident.
 When her husband wanted to cancel the Ener-D research because of many important reasons, it not only ended up being completely rejected by its sponsor, but also caused him to be replaced by his assistant,  Roman Goodwin . Soon after Roman was in control, they were killed by the  Zero Reverse  accident (In the English version, they had disappeared when the  Ener-D  began to malfunction).
