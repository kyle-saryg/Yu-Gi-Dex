 Summary 
 The scene starts with King Alexander telling Yami (in control of Yugi's body) that there is no way he can win. Then he orders his front line to attack. Tristan's  Shovel Crusher  and Tea's  Dark Witch  are destroyed. Then Joey attacks  Reflect Bounder , but his attacks has been reflected and he says "I should have seen that coming".  Grandpa 's  Curse of Dragon  and and Tea's  Seiyaryu  distract two of Alex's followers so Yugi can attack. He attacks with "Chaos Blade" and gets a direct hit on Alexander. But then Alexander attacks with "omni-directional laser assault."  Magician of Black Chaos  rescues Yugi and he exclaims: "Sorry; slight miscalculation on my part."  Curse of Dragon  then attacks  Total Defense Shogun  but the attack fails. After telling him that his lust for power would be his downfall, Yami attacks Alexander with  Celtic Guardian ,  Magician of Black Chaos , and  Black Luster Soldier . The attack causes Reshef's lasers to turn off. Alexander sacrifices his servants' monster, and, in turn, his servants, to release Reshef's full power. The gang's attacks have no effect. Yami tries to get his friends to leave, not wanting them to be hurt any further. They give a speech about how they are in this together, and will never leave their friend's side. Suddenly,  Seiyaryu ,  Red-Eyes Black Dragon ,  Curse of Dragon , and  Thunder Dragon  all combine around Yami, forming the armor of unity. Yami flies at Alexander, energy blasting through him. Alexander is finally defeated, and Yugi turns down the offer for ultimate power. Shadi compliments him on being a true warrior, and they all return home.
