 Crystal Beast : If " Crystal Beast Ruby Carbuncle " is in your  Spell & Trap Card Zone  as a Continuous Spell Card, it can be sent to the Graveyard to Special Summon " Hamon, Lord of Striking Thunder "/" Anteatereatingant "/etc. [1] 
 Previously Official Rulings 
   These TCG rulings were issued by  Upper Deck Entertainment  and have since been deemed unofficial by Konami. [2]  They were previously considered official and can still be correct, as long as they follow the official gameplay rules, or unless Konami has issued a ruling that says otherwise. References:  [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] 
 
 You can only activate this card’s effect once per turn. Even if “ Anteatereatingant ” can attack multiple times because it’s equipped with “ Twin Swords of Flashing Light – Tryce ”, it can only give up its potential to attack once. 
 The effect of “ Anteatereatingant ”  targets  1 Spell or Trap Card. 
 You can send a  Field Spell Card  to the Graveyard as part of the cost to  Special Summon  “ Anteatereatingant ”. You can also use a  Monster Card  treated as an  Equip Card , such as a  Union Monster  or a monster  equipped  to “ Relinquished  [ sic ] . 
 If you attack with “ Anteatereatingant ” and the attack is  negated  with “ Negate Attack ”, or a  replay  happens and you decide not to attack again, “ Anteatereatingant ” is still considered to have  declared  an attack. So you cannot activate its effect during  Main Phase 2 . 
 If you activate the effect of “ Anteatereatingant ”, then activate “ Skill Drain ”, “ Anteatereatingant ” still can’t attack that turn. (Even if “ Skill Drain ” was  chained  to the effect.) 
 You CAN activate the effect of “ Anteatereatingant ”,  flip  it  face-down  with a card effect, then  Flip Summon  it, and either activate its effect again or attack. This is because flipping it  face-down  resets its effect. (Also, if it’s temporarily  removed from play , its effect will also reset.) 
 If the  targeted  Spell or Trap Card is removed from the field in a  chain  to this card’s effect, you still cannot use its effect again or attack that turn. If a  targeted  Spell Card is not  destroyed  because of a counter from “ Magic Reflector ”, you still cannot use this card’s effect again or attack that turn.

 Notes 
 
 ↑   The latest errata of "Ancient Gear Drill" only states that the Spell Card cannot be activated, not that it cannot be used.
