For  the organization in  Yu-Gi-Oh! ARC-V , see  Sector Security (ARC-V) .      
       Sector Security members.     
 Sector Security , known as the  Public Security Maintenance Bureau  (ネオ童実野シティ治安維持局  Neo Domino Shiti Chian Iji Kyoku ) in the original anime, is an organization led by a Director, who attempts to maintain law and order in  New Domino City .
 The true goal behind the bureau is to prevent the evil sealed in the  Nazca Lines  by the  Crimson Dragon  from being reborn. They attempt to do this by cleansing evil from New Domino City, which  Rex Goodwin  believes to be the only present day utopia. This is done by keeping unworthy people out of New Domino and forcing them to reside in the run down  Satellite .
 Believing that allowing residents of Satellite into New Domino will cause the world to fall into disorder, some members, called  Securities , often deal with keeping residents of Satellite out of New Domino City.
 Sometime after  Z-one 's defeat, the organization is abolished as New Domino City switches to a government of elected officials. It is replaced by the New Domino City Police Department.  
 
 Director 
       The former director, Rex Goodwin.

 List of directors 
 
 Rex Goodwin  (formerly, deceased) 
 Lester ,  Jakob , and  Primo  (apparently all share this position, defected) 
 Lazar  (promoted to director when history was  falsified ) 
 Trivia 
 It's unknown when this organization was founded, but it's possible it was created after Zero Reverse by Goodwin himself to keep Satellite cutoff from the mainland of New Domino City to keep the Dark Signers at bay. In addition, they took over the normal Domino City government, replacing the mayor and city hall.
