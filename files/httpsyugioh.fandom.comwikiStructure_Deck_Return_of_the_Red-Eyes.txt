 Description 
 Special Summon " Red-Eyes " monsters with " Red-Eyes Fusion " or " Return of the Red-Eyes "! 
 
 " Red-Eyes Retro Dragon " When a Level 7 or lower "Red-Eyes" monster is destroyed by your opponent, you can Special Summon this monster from your hand. In addition, you can Special Summon the "Red-Eyes" monster that your opponent destroyed as well, throwing a wrench in your opponent's plans! 
" Red-Eyes Fusion " This "Fusion" Spell Card can only be used to Fusion Summon a Fusion Monster that list a "Red-Eyes" monster as a material. However, this Spell Card lets you use monsters from your Deck as Fusion Material (in addition to your hand and field), so if you put "Red-Eyes B. Dragon" in your Deck, you'll be able to Fusion Summon Red-Eyes Slash Dragon with this card alone! Be careful though, as you will not be able to Summon any monsters the turn you activate this card. 
 
A total of 17 types of Cards: 2  UR , 5  SR , 8  R , 2  N .
