 The  Battle Pack Tournament prize cards  are a set of 20  Starfoil Rare  prize cards available at  Sealed Pack tournaments . It was released alongside  Battle Pack: Epic Dawn .
 This set is split into two parts:
 
 Cards 1-12 are available at Top-Performing  Official Tournament Stores ,  Regional Qualifiers , and  Yu-Gi-Oh! Extravaganzas . 
 Cards 13-20 are available only at top-end events run directly by Konami, like the  Yu-Gi-Oh! Championship Series .
 Cards 13-20 do not appear to have been released in Europe, despite being listed in all European languages on the Yu-Gi-Oh! Trading Card Game - Card Database. 
 The cards included in this prize set are cards that Konami thought people would want as Starfoil Rare, but aren't appropriate for Sealed Pack Play.
