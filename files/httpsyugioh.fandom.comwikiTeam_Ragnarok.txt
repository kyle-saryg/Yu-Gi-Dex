 Team Ragnarok  is a team participating in the  WRGP . They are named after the legendary final battle that the gods will die in, told in Norse mythology. All 3 members of the team also have a  Rune Eye  each with a different color which signifies the fact that they are the holders of the three " Aesir " monsters. They are said to be the top team in the world.
 This trio debut on  Episode 117  as they're heading towards  New Domino City  by plane. At the time the sky is also hit by the  Three Pure Nobles '  reality warping technique  which affects the city, making the Nobles' team,  Team New World  immensely popular, even replacing the picture of Team Ragnarok with them on a magazine cover. However these individuals aren't affected because of the three  Aesir  cards they each wield. Halldor had a good understanding of the occurrence.
 At first when they met Team 5D's officially, they didn't believe that they had what it takes to stop the Divine Temple from falling on New Domino City since they believed Yusei would only carry a destiny of destruction as he was the son of  Dr. Fudo  who started  Zero Reverse  even though Yusei made it clear that was an accident. After Jack, Crow and Yusei defeat them and outmaneuver their signaures cards however, Halldor changes his perception of Yusei and believes that Yusei has what it takes to change the future for the better and lead people into the right direction.
 Despite losing to  Team 5D's , they later supply the  Signers  with  Rainbow Bridge Bifrost , an enchanted Spell Card which enables the three  Aesirs  to create a replica of the mythic Rainbow Bridge, spanning from the  Daedalus Bridge  to the  Divine Temple , granting the Signers access to it. Due to this, they use the power of the  Ener-D  from their  Valhallander , though they are shown to be injured by this process. As they get weaker, so too do their gods. Later, the Aesirs are seen to be destroyed and Yusei cries out to them. In  Episode 147  they are seen to have survived.
