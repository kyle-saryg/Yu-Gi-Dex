 A Meeting with Destiny!! 
 
 "Best Friends!!" , known as  "Burning Friendship!!"  in the Japanese version, is the ninth chapter of the  Yu-Gi-Oh! GX  manga . It was first printed in Japanese in the  V Jump  magazine and in English in the  Shonen Jump  magazine. Both of which were printed in  volume 1  of the  Yu-Gi-Oh! GX  graphic novels afterwards.
 
 Summary 
 Chazz Princeton  watches the  Duel  between  Jaden Yuki  and  Syrus Truesdale  from a distance.  Professor Hibiki  returns from her business trip, and is curious as why there's so much commotion at the Duel Field after school hours. She approaches Chazz, and he reveals the situation and that Syrus is dueling to avoid expulsion due to his grade of zero on the midterm. Syrus has  activated  " Transformation ", and he thinks he's bottled up the kindness his  brother  chided him for in this armor, which resembles the " Blue-Eyes White Dragon ". He reveals its effect, explaining why " Elemental Hero Stratos " was destroyed and the damage reduced to zero. He also reveals that he can  negate  as many attacks as he wants, but when "Transformation" is destroyed, he'll take damage equal to all the damage he negated with it.
 
       Syrus  encased in the armor granted to him by " Transformation ".     
 Jaden  Summons  " Elemental Hero Woodsman " in  Defense Position  and activates " Oil ", letting him return the  FIRE - attribute  " Elemental Hero Lady Heat " in his  Graveyard  to his  hand . Syrus believes he'll try to Summon " Elemental Hero Inferno ", but realizes he does not have " Polymerization " in his hand, but believes he'll  draw  it next turn. Jaden and ends his turn, and Syrus Summons " Shuttleroid " in  Attack Position . Jaden draws, and Syrus was correct - it's "Polymerization", which Jaden activates, fusing the "Lady Heat" and " Elemental Hero Heat " in his hand to  Fusion Summon  "Elemental Hero Inferno". He attacks Syrus' "Shuttleroid", and Syrus activates its effect, allowing him  remove  it from play for two turns, and letting "Transformation" destroy "Inferno". Despite what's on the line, and Syrus' impressive strength, Jaden is now finally enjoying himself.
 Syrus draws " Carrierroid " and Summons it. He recalled that Jaden asked him why he refers to him as "big brother", despite having a real big brother. Syrus thinks that it's because his real brother taught him to duel, and due to Jaden's skill, he reminds him of Zane. Jaden activates " Mystical Space Typhoon " to destroy "Transformation", but Syrus activates the effect of "Carrierroid", which lets him  discard  a card to remove "Transformation" from play for two turns, yet keep its effect active. Jaden ends his turn, and "Shuttleroid" returns to the  field , its effect inflicting Jaden 1000 points of damage. Syrus reveals that he may treat his three monsters as  Spell Cards  and Special Summon " Armoroid " from his  Fusion Deck , while  equipping  it with its own  Fusion Material Monsters . He attacks and destroys "Woodsman" and "Armoroid's" effect activates, dealing half of its attack points as damage.
 Jaden is shocked that he's about to lose, but knows that losing his Deck is not an option, because of who gave him the Deck to begin with. He plays " Pot of Greed ", drawing two cards. He Summons " Elemental Hero Voltic ", equipping it with " Voltic Spear ", which gives it a 1000-point attack boost. He then activates " Hero Solidarity ", removing two " Elemental Heroes " in his Graveyard from play and letting him destroy two Spell or  Trap Cards . He chooses two of "Armoroid's" equipped monsters, and its attack reduces to 1500 as a result. "Voltic" attacks and destroys "Armoroid", with the former's effect placing all removed from play cards into the Graveyard - including "Transformation", so Syrus takes damage via its effect, and Jaden wins the duel.
 Jaden protests to  Dr. Crowler  over Syrus being expelled over one zero, and Professor Hibiki arrives. She reveals that the transcripts Crowler took from her office were only provisional versions, and that there was a technicality. Syrus forgot to write his name down, so the computer automatically gave him a zero. He really scored a 91%. Hibiki had also submitted the finished transcripts to  Chancellor Sheppard  before leaving on her business trip, and intends to report Crowler to him. She also reveals that Jaden has to take a make-up midterm, with points automatically deducted, since he skipped the exam altogether.

Jaden draws and activates " Mystical Space Typhoon " in an attempt to destroy "Transformation", but Syrus activates the effect of "Carrierroid",  discarding  a card to remove "Transformation" from play for 2 turns, but retaining its effect.
 Syrus' turn 
"Shuttleroid" returns to the field during Syrus'  Standby Phase , dealing Jaden 1000 damage with its effect (Jaden: 4000 → 3000). Syrus  Special Summons  " Armoroid ",  equipping  "Shuttleroid", " Tankroid " and "Carrierroid" to it as  Equip Spell Cards . He attacks and destroys "Woodsman", with the effect of "Armoroid" dealing half its  ATK  as damage to Jaden (Jaden 3000 → 1650).
 Jaden's turn 
Jaden activates " Pot of Greed ", drawing two cards - " Hero Solidarity " and " Elemental Hero Voltic ". He Normal Summons "Elemental Hero Voltic" (1000/1600) in Attack Position and equips it with " Voltic Spear ", increasing its ATK by 1000, to 2000.
