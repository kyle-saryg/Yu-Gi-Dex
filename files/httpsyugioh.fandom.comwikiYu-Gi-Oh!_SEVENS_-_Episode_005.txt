 " Breaking News! ", known in Japan as " Luke, Fight of a Man " is the fifth episode of the  Yu-Gi-Oh! SEVENS  anime. It aired in Japan on May 2, 2020.
 The school's newspaper club came to interview  Yuga . Meanwhile,  Goha  has been keeping an eye on the internet. Perhaps Yuga can spread  Rush Duel  rules without attracting their attention by using printed newspapers?! However, it turns out that the newspaper club's goal is to denounce Rush Duels, for they think that Rush Duels are "shallow"! Angered by their insults,  Luke  decides to challenge them!
 
 Featured Duel: Tatsuhisa "Luke" Kamijo vs. Bakuro Shinjitsu 
 Turn 1: Bakuro 
Bakuro's hand contains " Delivery Machine Whirr ", " That's All From the Scene! ", " Duplicate Newspaper ", " News Flash Machine Toughroid ", and " It's an Accident ". Bakuro  sets  1 monster and 3 cards in his  Spell & Trap Zone . 
 Turn 2: Luke 
Luke  Normal Summons  " Dragolite " (Level 4/1500/0), " Dragon's Priestess " (Level 3/1100/100), and " Dragon Bat " (Level 3/1000/400). Luke activates " Piercing! "  Normal Spell Card , letting 1 face-up monster he controls inflict  piercing  damage this turn. He targets "Dragolite". Luke sets 1 Card in his Spell & Trap Zone.
 "Dragolite" attacks and destroys Bakuro's Set monster, which is revealed to be "Delivery Machine Whirr" (Level 1/0/200; Bakuro: 4000 → 2700  LP ). As a Defense Position monster he controlled was destroyed by battle, Bakuro activates his Set "It's an Accident"  Normal Trap Card , inflicting 300 damage to Luke (Luke: 4000 → 3700 LP). "Dragon's Priestess" attacks Bakuro  directly , but since his opponent declared a direct attack, Bakuro activates his Set Trap "That's All From the Scene!" Normal Trap Card, allowing him to send a  Machine  monster from his  hand  to the  GY  to inflict 300 damage to Luke and end the  Battle Phase . He sends "Toughroid" to the GY (Luke: 3700 → 3400 LP).
 Turn 3: Bakuro 
Bakuro Normal Summons two copies of "Whirr". He then  Tributes  both copies of "Whirr" to  Tribute Summon  "Toughroid" (Level ?/2300/1600). Bakuro activates "Duplicate Newspaper" Normal Spell Card, allowing him to choose a Machine monster he controls and  Special Summon  a monster with the same name from his GY, but it cannot attack directly and its effects are  negated . He chooses "Toughroid", and Special Summons another "Toughroid" from his GY in  Attack Position . Bakuro activates the effect of the 1st "Toughroid", allowing him to send the top card of his  Deck  to the GY to force Luke to  excavate  the top 5 cards of his Deck, and for each excavated monster, "Toughroid" will gain 100 ATK until the end of this turn, then Luke places the excavated cards on the bottom of his Deck in any order. Bakuro sends another "Toughroid" and Luke excavates " Return of Dragon ", " Fire Dragon's Heatflash ", " Palm-Sized Drago ", " Twin-Edge Dragon ", and " Rush Dragon Dragears " ("Toughroid": 2300 → 2600 ATK). Bakuro activates his Set  Spell  "Duplicate Newspaper" Normal Trap Card, choosing "Toughroid" and Special Summoning a third "Toughroid" from his GY in Attack Position. Bakuro Sets 1 Card in his Spell & Trap Zone.
 The 2 "Toughroids" with 2300 ATK attack and destroy "Dragon Bat" and "Dragon Priestess" (Luke: 3400 → 2100 → 900 LP). The "Toughroid" with 2600 ATK attacks "Dragolite", but Luke activates his set " Dragon's Tenacity " Normal Trap Card, allowing him to return a  Dragon  monster from his GY into his Deck to decrease the ATK of the attacking monster by the returned monster's  Level  x 100 until the end of this turn. He returns "Dragon's Priestess" ("Toughroid": 2600/1600 → 2300/1600). The attack continues and "Dragolite" is destroyed (Luke: 900 → 100 LP).
 Turn 4: Luke 
Luke activates " Dragonic Pressure " Normal Spell Card, allowing him to send 3 Dragon monsters from his hand to the GY to destroy all monsters on the field, and if a monster is destroyed by this effect, Luke can Special Summon a Level 4 or lower Dragon monster from his GY in face-up  Defense Position . Luke sends " Dragon's Setupper ", " Dragon's Upsetter ", and "Twin-Edge Dragon" to the GY, destroying all 3 copies of "Toughroid", then Special Summoning "Dragon's Setupper" (Level 1/0/1000) from his GY in Defense Position. Since his Machine monster was destroyed by a card effect during his opponent's turn, Bakuro activates his Set Trap " Reporter Soul " Normal Trap Card, allowing him to Special Summon a Machine monster from his GY in Attack Position. He Special Summons a "Toughroid" in Attack Position. Since he controls no other monsters, Luke activates the effect of "Dragon's Setupper", allowing him to Special Summon a "Dragon's Upsetter" from his GY in face-up Defense Position, but his Level 6 or lower monsters cannot attack this turn. He Special Summons "Dragon's Upsetter" in Defense Position (Level 3/1000/0). Luke Tributes "Setupper" and "Upsetter" to Tribute Summon "Rush Dragon Dragears" (Level 7/2500/1500). Luke activates the effect of "Dragears", allowing him to send the top card of his Deck ("Twin-Edge Dragon") to the GY to allow it to make a second attack this turn if it destroys an opponent's monster by battle.
 "Dragears" attacks and destroys "Toughroid" (Bakuro: 2700 → 2500 LP). Since it destroyed a monster by battle, the effect of "Dragears" lets it attack again. "Dragears" attacks Bakuro directly (Bakuro: 2500 → 0 LP).
