 History 
       Mayday and Brooke on their wedding day     
 Mayday and  Brooke  were a couple that just got married. After the wedding, they become a pro Dueling couple. [1] 
 
 Yu-Gi-Oh! ZEXAL II 
 They were invited to participate at the  Heartland Academy  Fun Fair for a  Couples Duel tournament . Unknown to him,  Brooke  was brainwashed by  Vector  moments before he came to get her. At the tournament, Mayday encountered his wife's friend and guest from their wedding,  Anna Kaboom , who had stolen a school uniform from  Tori Meadows  to pose as a student in order to angrily confront Broo  eto learn why she wanted to quit Dueling. Mayday tried to help Brooke explain why she wanted to quit Dueling, but they decided to settle things with a  Tag-Team Duel  against Anna and her partner,  Yuma Tsukumo . The Duel started with Mayday Summoning " Indestructible Airship Hindenkraft ". Supporting one another with card effects, they then Summoned " Skypalace Gangaridai ". Mayday used "Gangaridai" to  destroy  Anna's " Superdreadnought Rail Cannon Gustav Max " and then launched a  direct attack  against Yuma. [1] 
 After Yuma used " Half Unbreak " to survive the attack, Mayday was impressed and praised him. Mayday continued to protect his wife from other attacks, but was shocked by her sudden change in character when she drew " Rank-Up-Magic Barian's Force ". Brooke gave Mayday control of " CXyz Skypalace Babylon " and was ordered by her to win the Duel no matter what, much to his confusion. After she was defeated, Mayday caught her before she violently fell to the ground and was relieved that she returned to normal. In the evening, Mayday chatted with Yuma and confirmed to Anna that he and Brooke were going have a baby together. He was surprised when his wife pushed Anna towards Yuma and watched as the pair fell down a flight of stairs. [2]
