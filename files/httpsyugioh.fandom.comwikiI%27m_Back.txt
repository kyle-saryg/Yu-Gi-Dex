 Lyrics 
 
 Disappeared 
Out of here 
It was time to pay my dues 
Never guessed 
That you'd be dressed 
In my clothes and in my shoes 
 
You couldn't wait to move right in 
If I were you I'd be concerned 
Ain't no way you're gonna win 
Betcha didn't count on my return 
 
_CHORUS_ 
Thought you were so tough 
You had it all under control 
Now enough is enough 
Gonna take back what you stole 
{Give it up, 'cause now I'm back} 
 
On my own 
All alone 
This ain't how the story ends 
Now I see 
Those close to me 
They were just fair-weather friends 
 
You suckered everyone in sight 
With promises that fooled them all 
You may be top dog tonight 
The bigger they come, the harder they fall 
 
_CHORUS_ 
Thought you were so tough 
You had it all under control 
Now enough is enough 
Gonna take back what you stole 
{Give it up, 'cause now I'm back} 
 
"For our plan to succeed, Kaiba must be taken out of the picture, permanently." 
"You'll never take me alive!" 
"Seto Kaiba will bother us no more, hahahahahaha!" 
"I'm not going to give up Kaiba Corporation without a real fight!" 
"It's takeover time, by me." 
"I attack with the Blue Eyes White Dragon!" 
 
_CHORUS_ 
Thought you were so tough 
You had it all under control 
Now enough is enough 
Gonna take back what you stole 
{Give it up, 'cause now I'm back} 
 
"We're going in." 
"Big brother! You're here! You're here!"
