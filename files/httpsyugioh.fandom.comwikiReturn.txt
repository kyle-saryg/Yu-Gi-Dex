 Return  ( 戻 す  Modosu ) is a form of moving a card to an "original" location.
 Moving cards from the  field ,  Graveyard ,  Banished  Zone, or  Extra Deck  to the  hand ; moving a card to the  Extra Deck  ( face-down ) or the  Main Deck ; moving a  banished  card to the  Graveyard ; and moving a temporarily banished card back where it was originally with the effect that banished it are all forms of returning.
 Changing  control  of a monster to its  owner  is referred to as returning control, and putting a  revealed  card back in its original  position  is referred to as returning to its original position.

 Returning to the hand or Deck 
 Shuffling  a card into the  Main Deck  and placing a card on the top or bottom of the Main Deck are both forms of returning to the Main Deck (unless they were put there from the Main Deck). Shuffling a card into the  Extra Deck  is also a form of returning to the Extra Deck.  Adding  a  banished  card or a card from the  Graveyard  to the  hand  is a form of returning.
 If an  Extra Deck  monster would be returned to the hand or  Main Deck , it is instead returned to the Extra Deck.
 When a monster is  destroyed by battle  during the  Damage Step , it cannot be returned from the field to the hand, Deck, or Extra Deck (unless a card effect specifically permits it, such as " Grave Protector "). When a  Normal ,  Quick-Play  or  Ritual Spell Card , or a  Normal  or  Counter Trap Card  is  activated , it cannot be returned from the field to the hand or Deck during that  Chain  unless it has an effect that would cause it to remain on the field after activation, such as " Swords of Revealing Light " or " Kunai with Chain " (unless a card effect specifically permits it, such as " Goblin Out of the Frying Pan ").
 
 
 Returning banished cards to the Graveyard 
 When returning  banished  cards to the  Graveyard , returning is not considered to be  sending  a card to the Graveyard. Thus, cards like " Miracle Dig " and " Fortune's Future " can be used to return monsters to the Graveyard even if " Macro Cosmos " is active; the returned cards will not be banished again. Furthermore, banished cards with an effect that activates if the card is sent to the Graveyard, such as " Performage Trick Clown ", also do not activate their effects when returning to the Graveyard.
 
 
 Returning temporarily banished cards 
 Some effects can temporarily  banish  cards from the  field  or  hand , then later return them.
 If a monster is temporarily banished from the field, such as by " Interdimensional Matter Transporter " or " Ninjitsu Art of Shadow Sealing ", it is not  Summoned  when it is returned to the field. Whether or not it will be destroyed by " Jowgen the Spiritualist " depends on how it was originally Summoned. If a temporarily banished monster would return to the field but there is no free  Monster Zone , it is sent to the Graveyard.
