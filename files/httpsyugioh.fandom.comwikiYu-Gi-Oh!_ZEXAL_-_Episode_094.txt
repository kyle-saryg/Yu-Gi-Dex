 Summary 
       Ray  telling  Yuma  not to let  Astral  know of this event.     
 At night,  Yuma  receives an urgent call from  Ray  and rushes to his aid. Ray tells Yuma to hurry, then screams before the  Duel Gazer  transmission is cut off. When Yuma arrives at the location, he witnesses Ray Dueling a  Barian  clad in a dark purple cloak in a Barian  Sphere Field . Ray congratulates Yuma for making it (in the dub, Ray asks if Yuma is reporting for duty, which Yuma confirms). The Barian soon retreats and Yuma asks Ray if he is alright and who the Barian he Dueled was. Ray explains that he is called Vector and has troubled the  Barian Cosmic Crime Unit  for a long time. Ray gets up and tells Yuma that he will move on to follow Vector, while Yuma will remain behind to protect Earth from the Barians. He gives Yuma  new cards  to use against the Barians. Yuma wishes to tell  Astral  about what he saw, but Ray warns him to not to do so, or else he won't be able to continue his mission and maintain his cover. Ray leaves through a portal.
 
       Vector  appears before  Dumon  and  Mizar .     
 Meanwhile, in the  Barian World ,  Mizar  is worried over  Alito  and  Girag  because they still have not awakened after being defeated by Yuma. They remain in regenerative stasis inside  Baria Crystals .  Dumon  suggests that after all that transpired, they themselves must act. Their conversation is interrupted by Vector, who appears on the throne situated on top of the staircase. He asks Mizar and Dumon if they are imitating repentance through these gloomy times. Vector calls Girag and Alito a total mess. He insults them further by calling them "powerless scrubs" and criticizes Mizar and Dumon for the situation the Barians are in (in the dub, Vector's insults toward Girag and Alito are changed. First, he mocks Girag by "protesting" that they are not weak. He mocks Alito by "asking" if they can be cured. Vector finishes by claiming that he can't, because he's a "veterinarian"). 
 
       Mizar attempting to attack Vector.     
 Angered, Mizar attempts to attack Vector but is stopped by Dumon, saying that it is not the time for fighting. Mizar backs down, saying that he won't stop next time. Dumon points out that Vector shows up on a whim (in the dub, Dumon says that it's good for Vector to show up, but he missed out on a lot), as well as the failures of Vector's plan in using  Vetrix  and  Dr. Faker ; he also criticizes Vector for not taking responsibility for his actions and asks where he disappeared to. Vector claims they were not failures but also part of his plan of defeating Yuma, Astral, Shark and Kite all at once. He calls it a "grand victory within thousands of failures" (in the dub, Vector asserts that he knows what he's doing) and says that Dumon and Mizar should put the affair into his hands. Mizar protests that no one wanted to hear Vector's plan, but Dumon intervenes and agrees with Vector on the condition that he will not act on his own again; if he does, Dumon will end him with his own hands. Vector chuckles and declares that he will continue his plan.
 The next day, at a rooftop, Yuma looks over at the new cards Ray had given to him and becomes very excited; he claims that with these cards, not even the Barians can stop him.  Tori  appears next to Yuma and asks what he's so excited about.  Cathy  also appears and criticizes him for keeping secrets from her and the others.  Bronk  climbs up a ladder and asks Yuma why he's standing there (in the dub, Bronk points out that it's obvious Yuma is keeping secrets).  Caswell  and  Flip  show up from behind the water tower and say that Yuma can't hide things from them. Yuma sighs in disappointment. The group decides to accompany Yuma to look for the Barians. Bronk calls out for the Barians to appear. Flip asks if a Barian is here or not (in the dub, Flip also calls out for the Barians). Cathy says that if a Barian shows up, she will give them a good beating. Yuma asks his friends why they're helping him, (in the dub, Yuma says that it's not a good idea to get the Barians mad at him) and Tori says that they're helping him because they want to. Yuma is irritated and is about to lash at Tori, when suddenly, an energy ball appears and nearly throws the group to the ground. It then shears through and destroys several buildings. Yuma asks if everyone is okay. Bronk and Flip reassure him that they're okay. Astral then appears and asks what is happening. Yuma is about to explain before he hears laughter from nearby (in the dub, Yuma fully explains that it must be the Barians).
 
         Vector confronts Yuma and Astral.     
 Shortly, a cloaked Barian approaches Yuma and his group and declares that he is Vector, the Barian World's mightiest warrior. Yuma recalls Ray mentioning him. Vector declares that he'll destroy Yuma, Astral and the world. Yuma asks what Vector means (in the dub, he asks Astral on what to do), while Astral tells him to get his friends to safety. Yuma does so and Tori and the others run away. Vector throws his  Barian Sphere Cube  to activate a Sphere Field. Tori yells Yuma's name. Inside the Sphere Field, Vector gets excited as he has not Dueled Yuma for some time. Yuma says that he has never met Vector before and does not know who Vector is. Vector is incensed and asks Yuma if he has forgotten  the last time they Dueled , when he took over  Dr. Faker 's body and that they had fun Dueling. Yuma and Astral realize that he was the Barian that took over Faker's body, with Vector saying that it was an honor to have Dueled Yuma. Vector is finally pleased that Yuma and Astral remember him (in the dub, Vector says that his manipulation of Dr. Faker was only a preview on what will come next). He declares that he will take over not just the  Astral World  but the human world as well. Yuma tells him that he will not just let him do what he wants. The two engage their  D-Pads  and commence the Duel. Vector says it will be or the worst if they don't get started.
 
         " Number 66: Master Key Beetle " is Summoned.     
 Vector takes the first turn and Normal Summons " Umbral Horror Ghoul ". He activates its effect; by reducing its ATK to 0, he can Special Summon another "Umbral Horror" monster with 0 ATK from his hand. He Special Summons " Umbral Horror Unform ". A black mist exudes from "Ghoul" and "Unform" emerges from it. Astral says that Vector is ready to Xyz Summon. Vector overlays his two Level 4 DARK monsters to Xyz Summon " Number 66: Master Key Beetle ". Yuma exclaims that Vector Summoned a " Number " monster right from the beginning. Astral simply mutters "Master Key Beetle" (in the dub, Astral says this will not look good for them). Vector activates the Continuous Spell Card, " Magical Tomb " to seal away a card in his opponent's Deck. Yuma is surprised at the card as the coffin emerges, but Vector says he's aware that Yuma has a Barian card in his Deck and chooses to seal away " Rank-Up-Magic Limited Barian's Force " with "Magical Tomb".
 The coffin opens and makes its way towards Yuma's Deck. "Limited Barian's Force" is then taken and placed inside the coffin. Astral exclaims that their "Rank-Up" card was sealed away, while Yuma mutters that he can't use " Utopia Ray V ". Vector activates the effect of "Master Key Beetle", detaching an  Overlay Unit  to prevent a card from being destroyed while "Master Key Beetle" is on the field. A set of chains wraps around "Magical Tomb". Yuma is frustrated that Vector locked up "Limited Barian's Force" so tightly. Astral asks if Vector is afraid of the card's power. Vector Sets a card and ends his turn. He says that without "Limited Barian's Force", Yuma and Astral can't win. Tori mutters Yuma's name. Vector asks Yuma what's wrong and to come at him.
 Yuma begins his turn. He draws and Normal Summons " Gagaga Magician ". He then activates " Gagagawind " to Special Summon a " Gagaga " monster from his hand and raise its Level by 1. Yuma Special Summons " Gagaga Girl ", which becomes a Level 4 monster (part of the Summoning animation of "Gagaga Girl" is cut from the dub). Flip, Cathy and Tori cheer for Yuma. Yuma overlays his two Level 4 monsters to Xyz Summon " Number 39: Utopia ". Upon seeing "Utopia", Vector cackles, saying that it's useless without "Limited Barian's Force". He asks if that's what they call "hoping for evolution" (in the dub, Vector says that without "Limited Barian's Force", it will take a miracle for Yuma to win). Astral reminds Yuma to use the effect of "Gagaga Girl". Yuma does so and declares " Cell Phone Subtraction ", reducing the ATK of "Master Key Beetle" to 0. Vector is shocked that "Master Key Beetle" is now powerless. Yuma attacks "Master Key Beetle" with "Utopia", declaring " Rising Sun Slash ". "Master Key Beetle" is engulfed in an explosion, knocking Vector back and reducing his Life Points to 1500. 
 Vector rises and activates the effect of "Master Key Beetle", sending the card that he targeted by its previous effect, "Magical Tomb", to the Graveyard to prevent his monster's  destruction by battle . The chains around "Magical Tomb" disappear and it shatters, revealing "Limited Barian's Force". "Master Key Beetle" reappears. Vector adds that the card sealed away with "Magical Coffin" will be added to Yuma's hand at the end of the turn. Yuma is pleased that he got his card back. Astral thinks that it's strange for Vector to let go of "Limited Barian's Force" this easily. Vector activates " Corrupted Keys ", Special Summoning three " Umbral Horror Mirage Tokens " as "Master Key Beetle" was not destroyed by battle. Each of the Tokens will always have ATK equal to that of "Master Key Beetle"; a hologram of "Master Key Beetle" appears below each Token. Yuma says that each of the Tokens have 0 ATK. Astral says that Vector must be planning something. Yuma ends his turn while "Limited Barian's Force" returns to Yuma's hand. Astral tells Yuma to focus on the Duel.
 Vector begins his turn. He activates " Umbral Horror Refresh ", returning the ATK of "Master Key Beetle" to its original value and gaining  Life Points  equal to that amount while also increasing the ATK of all his "Mirage Tokens" to 2500, shocking Yuma. Vector attacks "Utopia" with two the "Mirage Tokens". Yuma says that the Tokens and "Utopia" both have 2500 ATK and that only "Number" monsters can only be destroyed by battle with other "Number" monsters. Astral urges Yuma to use the effect of "Utopia". Yuma is shocked at this, but Astral tells him that Vector may be planning something (in the dub, Yuma agrees with Astral at this point). Hesitating, and declaring " Light Wing Shield ", Yuma activates the effect of "Utopia" twice, detaching both of its Overlay Units to negate the attacks. The third "Umbral Horror Token" attacks but is destroyed while "Utopia" was not, since the Token was not a " Number " monster. 
 Yuma is puzzled on why Vector would destroy his own monster, but Astral realizes that Vector had something planned all along. The third "Umbral Horror Mirage Token" charges at "Utopia" and "Utopia" destroys it by slashing it with its sword. Vector activates " Umbral Horror Retaliation ", explaining that when an "Umbral Horror" monster he  controls  is destroyed, it destroys the monster his "Umbral Horror" monster battled. Yuma exclaims, "No way!" and the card releases a burst of purple electricity at "Utopia", destroying it. Vector declares a  direct attack  with "Master Key Beetle". He declares " Key Blast " as "Master Key Beetle" fires electricity from its horn, which knocks Yuma back and reduces him to 1500 Life Points. Vector ends his turn. He asks Yuma if he should just be sitting there. Vector adds that the Sphere Field can swallow up everything in the city in an instant before laughing maniacally (this part, after Vector ends his turn, is cut from the dub).
 
         Ray arrives and cheers Yuma on.     
 Yuma curses, while Astral says that Vector still has three monsters on his field, while he and Yuma have none on theirs. Yuma is frustrated that he can't Rank-Up without "Utopia". Suddenly, he hears Ray's voice from afar, calling out to him. Yuma's friends are surprised by his arrival. Vector says "you vermin...!" Ray yells out to Yuma not to give up and to believe in his Deck (in the dub, Ray tells Yuma to use his secret weapons). Yuma remembers that Ray gave him new cards the previous night. Yuma and Ray exchange nods, while Astral mutters Yuma's name (in the dub, Astral asks, "What secret weapons?"). Yuma regains some of his lost hope and yells " kattobingu !" and draws " V Salamander ", one of the cards that Ray gave him. Yuma Normal Summons "Salamander" and activates its effect, Special Summoning "Utopia" from the Graveyard. Vector is surprised that Yuma has a card that can bring "Utopia" back. "Utopia" reappears on Yuma's side of the field. Yuma then activates "Rank-Up-Magic Limited Barian's Force" performing a  Chaos Xyz Evolution  to Summon "Utopia Ray V". Yuma activates the effect of "V Salamander" and declares " Salamander Cloth ", equipping it to "Utopia Ray V". "Utopia Ray V" is engulfed in flames as "V Salamander" disappears and reappears on the former as armor. Tori and the others are amazed. Yuma activates the effect of "Utopia Ray V", detaching a Chaos Overlay Unit to destroy a monster on the field and inflict damage to the opponent equal to its ATK. Vector says that he has three monsters, but Yuma activates the other effect of "V Salamander" to change the target to all monsters Vector controls, leaving Vector stunned. 
 Yuma says that Vector has three monsters with 2500 ATK, totaling up to 7500 damage. He declares " V Salamander Inferno ", as the heads of "V Salamander" release four fire blasts at Vector's monsters, destroying them. As Vector braces himself, he mutters, "Impossible! My monsters..." ("No! I lost!" in the dub) before he is knocked back and his Life Points fall to 0. Yuma and his friends cheer over the victory. As the Sphere Field disappears, Astral looks at "Utopia Ray V", equipped with "V Salamander" and mutters, "V Salamander...what a card" (in the dub, Astral thinks that Yuma never told him that he had another Barian card). Yuma asks Vector if he learned how strong he and Astral are (in the dub, Yuma says that Vector should know not to mess with him or Astral). Vector chuckles and releases a shadow hand at Yuma in an attempt to kidnap him, but Ray steps in front of Yuma and is taken instead. Yuma yells Ray's name and Ray says that it's for the best before he is dragged towards Vector (in the dub, Ray apologizes to Yuma and says that this is his fault for dragging him into this). Vector laughs and asks if Yuma thought he'd lose to the likes of him (in the dub, Vector says that he doesn't like leaving empty-handed).
 
         Ray getting captured by Vector.      A portal appears behind Vector and he says that he'll settle for Ray instead for now. Yuma curses at Vector. Just before Vector disappears, he throws the "Master Key Beetle" card to Astral, saying that it will be the key to the ultimate battle (in the dub, Vector says that it will be a clue to where he will take Ray). Yuma attempts to save Ray, but Vector disappears before that happens. Yuma screams at the sky, with everyone watching him. Yuma vows to take him back as he shouts Ray's name as a clip focuses on the sun.
 Featured Duels 
 Ray Shadows vs. Vector 
 Duel already in progress.  Ray   controls  no cards, while  Vector  controls " Umbral Horror Ghoul " ( 4/1800/0) in  Attack Position .
 When  Yuma  arrives at their location Vector retreats, so the Duel ends with no result.
 
 Yuma Tsukumo vs. Vector 
 Turn 1: Vector  
 Vector  draws. He then  Normal Summons  " Umbral Horror Ghoul " ( 4/1800/0) in Attack Position. Vector then  activates  the  effect  of "Umbral Horror Ghoul" to reduce its  ATK  to 0 ("Umbral Horror Ghoul": 1800 → 0 ATK) and  Special Summon  " Umbral Horror Unform " (an " Umbral Horror " monster with 0 ATK) ( 4/0/0) in Attack Position. Vector  overlays  "Umbral Horror Ghoul" and "Umbral Horror Unform" in order to  Xyz Summon  " Number 66: Master Key Beetle " ( 4/2500/800, ORU: 2) in  Attack Position . 
 Vector activates " Magical Tomb " to take " Rank-Up-Magic Limited Barian's Force " from  Yuma 's  Deck  and place it under "Magical Tomb". Vector then activates the second effect of "Master Key Beetle" to  detach  an  Overlay Unit  ("Master Key Beetle": 2 → 1 ORU) and  target  "Magical Tomb" in order to prevent it from being  destroyed  by card effects while "Master Key Beetle" is on the  field . Vector  Sets  a card.
 Turn 2: Yuma  
Yuma  draws  " Gagaga Magician " and subsequently Normal Summons it ( 4/1500/1000) in Attack Position. He then activates " Gagagawind " to Special Summon " Gagaga Girl " (a " Gagaga " monster) in Attack Position with its Level increased by one ( 3 → 4/1000/800). Yuma overlays "Gagaga Magician" and "Gagaga Girl" in order to Xyz Summon " Number 39: Utopia " ( 4/2500/2000, ORU: 2) in Attack Position. As "Gagaga Girl" was used for an Xyz Summon with another " Gagaga " monster, Yuma activates its effect to reduce the ATK of "Master Key Beetle" to 0 ("Master Key Beetle": 2500 → 0 ATK). 
 "Utopia" attacks "Master Key Beetle", but Vector activates the last effect of "Master Key Beetle" to send "Magical Tomb" (a card protected by the effect of "Master Key Beetle") to the Graveyard and prevent "Master Key Beetle" from being destroyed (Vector: 4000 → 1500 LP). As a monster he controlled was attacked but was not destroyed by battle, Vector activates his face-down " Corrupted Keys " to target "Master Key Beetle" and Special Summon three " Umbral Horror Mirage Tokens " in Attack Position, who will always have the same ATK as "Master Key Beetle" ( 1/0/0 each). On Yuma's End Phase, the final effect of "Magical Tomb" adds "Rank-Up-Magic Limited Barian's Force" to Yuma's hand as "Magical Tomb" was sent to the Graveyard.
 Turn 3: Vector  
 
         " Number 66: Master Key Beetle " and three " Umbral Horror Mirage Tokens ".     
 Vector draws " Umbral Horror Refresh " and subsequently activates it to return the ATK of "Master Key Beetle" to its  original value  and gain  Life Points  equal to the change in ATK ("Master Key Beetle": 0 → 2500 ATK, Vector: 1500 → 4000 LP)("Umbral Horror Mirage Tokens": 0 → 2500 ATK for all). Two "Umbral Horror Mirage Tokens" attack "Utopia", but Yuma activates the effect of "Utopia" twice to detach both its Overlay Units ("Utopia": 2 → 0 ORU) and  negate  each attack. The third "Umbral Horror Mirage Token" attacks "Utopia". "Utopia" destroys the "Umbral Horror Mirage Token" since the latter was not a " Number " monster. As an "Umbral Horror" monster he controlled was destroyed by battle, Vector activates " Umbral Horror Retaliation " to destroy "Utopia" (as it was the monster that destroyed the "Umbral Horror" monster). "Master Key Beetle" attacks directly (Yuma: 4000 → 1500 LP).
 Turn 4: Yuma  
 
         " Number C39: Utopia Ray V " being  equipped  with " V Salamander ".     
 Yuma draws " V Salamander " and subsequently Normal Summons it ( 4/1500/1300) in Attack Position. As "V Salamander" was Normal Summoned, Yuma activates the first effect of "V Salamander" to revive "Utopia" ( 4/2500/2000) in Attack Position. Yuma then activates "Rank-Up-Magic Limited Barian's Force" to  Rank-Up  "Utopia" via  Chaos Xyz Evolution  in order to Xyz Summon " Chaos Number 39: Utopia Ray V " ( 5/2600/2000, ORU: 1) in Attack Position. 
 Yuma then activates the second effect of "V Salamander" to  equip  it to "Utopia Ray V" (a " V " monster). Yuma activates the effect of "Utopia Ray V" to destroy all monster his opponent controls (through the fourth effect of "V Salamander") and inflict damage to Vector equal to the combined ATK of his destroyed monsters on the field (through the final effect of "V Salamander") by detaching "Utopia" ("Utopia Ray V": 1 → 0 ORU) (Vector: 4000 → 0 LP).

 Mistakes 
         Yuma's  hand .     
 When  Yuma 's hand in shown, one of the cards appears to be " Rank-Up-Magic Barian's Force ". Presumably, this was intended to be " Rank-Up-Magic Limited Barian's Force ", as Yuma had no means to obtain a copy of the former card. This was corrected in the dub. 
 When  Vector   activated  " Umbral Horror Retaliation ", before the explanation of the  effect , the card was  face-up , but later when the effect connects, the card is  face-down . 
 Differences from the preview 
 In the preview, when " Number 66: Master Key Beetle " was Summoned, it had no  Overlay Units ; this was fixed when the episode aired. 
 Notes 
 
 ↑  1.0   1.1   This card can be seen in  Yuma 's hand after " Number 66: Master Key Beetle "  attacks   directly . It can also be seen when Yuma gets up.
