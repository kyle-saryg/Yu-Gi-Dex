      " Dark Sage ", a Special Summon-only monster     
 Special Summon-only monsters , often referred to as  Semi-Nomi  monsters, are monsters with the card text " Cannot be  Normal Summoned / Set . Must first be  Special Summoned ... " (or an older variant). [1]  Modern Japanese cards indicate this by indicating "特殊召喚" next to the monster's  Type , akin to how  Spirit ,  Tuner  and  Union  subtypes are indicated.
 Ritual ,  Fusion ,  Synchro ,  Xyz , and  Link Monsters  that are Special Summon-only monsters do not include the text " Cannot be Normal Summoned/Set. " because it is unnecessary; if they can be Ritual/Fusion/Synchro/Xyz Summoned, they replace " Must first be Special Summoned " with " Must first be Ritual/Fusion/Synchro/Xyz Summoned ".
 Some examples of Special Summon-only monsters include " Aqua Spirit ", " XYZ-Dragon Cannon " and " Gem-Knight Ruby ".

 Mechanics 
 A Special Summon-only monster cannot be Special Summoned from the  hand ,  Main Deck ,  Extra Deck , or  Spell & Trap Zone , except by the specified method, unless the card effect  ignores the Summoning conditions .
 A Special Summon-only monster can be Special Summoned from the  Graveyard  or while  banished  as long as it was Special Summoned properly first. If the Summon of a Special Summon-only monster is  negated  (such as by " Black Horn of Heaven ") it is not considered to have been properly Special Summoned. If a Special Summon-only monster is in the Graveyard or banished and was not Special Summoned properly, it cannot be Special Summoned by any means other than the proper method, even by ignoring the Summoning conditions. This contrasts to " Nomi " monsters, which can only be Summoned by their own effect, even after they have been properly Special Summoned.
 After being properly Special Summoned, as long as that Monster Card remains on the field (even if  face-down ), in the Graveyard, or banished, it is considered properly Special Summoned.
 
 Example 
 A player  banishes  three  Fiend - Type  monsters from the Graveyard to Special Summon " Dark Necrofear ".
 
 If "Dark Necrofear" is  sent  to the Graveyard, such as by being destroyed by " Raigeki Break ", it can be Special Summoned from the Graveyard with a card like " Monster Reborn ". 
 If "Dark Necrofear" is banished, such as by " Dark Core ", it can be Special Summoned while banished with a card like " Dimensional Inversion ". 
 However, if it is moved to other locations, it cannot be Special Summoned except by the specified method.
 
 If "Dark Necrofear" is  returned  to the  hand  or  Deck , such as by " Compulsory Evacuation Device " or " Phoenix Wing Wind Blast ", it cannot be Special Summoned by any way other than the proper way (except by a card or effect that  ignores its Summoning conditions , like " A Wild Monster Appears! ").
 Even if it is later sent to the Graveyard or banished, such as by " Graceful Charity " or " Allure of Darkness ", it cannot be Special Summoned because it was not properly Special Summoned.
