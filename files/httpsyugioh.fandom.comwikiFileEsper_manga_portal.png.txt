 Biography 
         Espa Roba linework.     
 Espa made his first appearance in a brief non speaking role in the town square, when  Mai Valentine  was pointing out the Battle City participants to  Yugi Muto  and  Téa Gardner  and what their deck and strategies were. She said he dueled using psychic powers.
 Espa was a young Duelist who entered  Battle City  to uphold his reputation and protect his younger brothers. He was first shown defeating  Rex Raptor  and taking " Serpent Night Dragon ". Rex advised  Joey Wheeler  not to  Duel  Espa on the grounds that his psychic abilities allowed him to read all the cards in his hand. With an air of self-confidence (and being skeptical of his supposed powers as he’d already experienced this with Mai Valentine), Joey accepted the Duel.
 
         Espa pretending to have a psychic vision.     
 Although Espa initially gained an advantage due to the fact he knew what cards were in Joey's hand and on his  field , Joey inferred what was happening and attempted to confuse his watchers from above by putting the cards " Skull Dice " and " Graceful Dice " close to each other.
 Mokuba Kaiba  eventually discovered the source of Espa's "psychic" abilities; his brothers spied upon Joey's hand from upon a high rise building. However, the brothers pleaded with Mokuba to let Espa continue with the Duel, stating that he was a strong Duelist despite his cheating ways. 
 The psychic front was to build an impression of an unbeatable Duelist and thus deflected any abuse that was usually heaped upon Espa and his brothers, they were heavily bullied due to being carnival folk in the past. To Mokuba, this situation paralleled his brotherly relationship with his older brother,  Seto  and he let Espa continue the Duel, only on the grounds that he stop cheating. Due to this, Espa's psychic reputation was tarnished, but he continued his Duel with Joey nevertheless.

 Espa eventually  Summoned  " Jinzo ", who severely crippled Joey's overall strategy. Finally, Joey  activated  " Roulette Spider " which forced "Jinzo" to  attack  a random card on the field, "Jinzo" attacked " Reflect Bounder ", who then reflected the assault back on "Jinzo",  destroying  them both, causing Espa to lose the Duel.
 Due to the Battle City regulations, Espa forfeited his rarest card, "Jinzo", to Joey upon his defeat and commented that he was ready to stand up for his brothers without cheating. He also promised to duel Joey again someday, but in a fair duel with no cheating.
 He was later seen observing the semifinal match between Yugi and Kaiba in Domino City amongst other Duelists.
 Espa made a cameo in the Japanese epilogue, appearing to challenge  Mako Tsunami  to a Duel.
 
 Yu-Gi-Oh! 5D's 
 In  Yu-Gi-Oh! 5D's , a parody of him named  Esper Rouba  is listed as one the Duelists defeated by  Hunter Pace . [3]
