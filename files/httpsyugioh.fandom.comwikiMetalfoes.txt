 Design 
 Appearance 
 The monsters of this archetype are based on the anime  Megazone 23  and  Genesis Climber MOSPEADA , the latter of which has been adapted into  Robotech . The Fusion Monsters resemble the Pendulum Monsters' vehicles transformed into power suits, as depicted in " Metalfoes Fusion " and seen with " Goldriver " and " Orichalc ", the latter of which resembles the MOSPEADA unit in its battle form. Other "Metalfoes" members are based off other popular media such as  Akira  and  Fullmetal Alchemist .
 
 Etymology 
 The Japanese name of this archetype is a portmanteau of the English word  metal  and the German word for "metamorphosis". The English name additionally includes the word  foe . All other names are simply portmanteaus that are similar to the Japanese one.
 While the Pendulum Monsters of this archetype are named after real life metals/alloy, the mythical and legendary metals/alloy are used for Fusion Monsters.

 Playing style 
 The Main Deck "Metalfoes" monsters are comprised of  Normal Pendulum Monsters , except for the  Effect   Pendulum Monster  " Raremetalfoes Bismugear ", that all have the Pendulum Effect to destroy one of the player's own cards and  Set  a "Metalfoes" Spell or Trap Card from the Deck simultaneously. Their playstyle is similar to the " Igknight " archetype, which is also FIRE Pendulum-based deck with tendencies of destroying each other to search one another. Because they can destroy any face-up card to have their effects running, they are largely viable to be used with several cards or archetypes that benefit from destruction such as " Yang Zing " in order to generate multiple advantage in rapid succession.
 Aside from Pendulum Summoning, this archetype can Fusion Summon with " Metalfoes Fusion ", which can easily return itself to the Deck for a free draw; it can then can be searched out again with the Pendulum "Metalfoes" monsters to repeat the process. " Metalfoes Combination " can be used with " Painful Decision " to gain more field advantage from Fusion Summons while also recovers those spent monsters. Furthermore, most "Metalfoes" Fusion Monsters require completely generic materials -  further emphasizing their splashability and capacity for mixing with other Decks with little problem. Mixing in other Pendulum archetypes can allow for powerful field presence, using Pendulum Monsters as materials from the field, and Pendulum Summoning those materials back from the Extra Deck later.
 The effect of " Metalfoes Orichalc " gives all "Metalfoes" monsters double  piercing  damage, which allows them to benefit from cards that force your opponent's monsters into Defense Position, such as " Book of Moon ," " Book of Eclipse ," " Swords of Concealing Light ," and " Quaking Mirror Force ". Alternatively the player can also focus on the Field Spell " Metamorformation " which renders all non-effect "Metalfoes" monsters unaffected by the opponent's cards effects while giving them a 300 ATK/DEF boost, making otherwise simple monsters into far more formidable threats.
 The Deck's  Link Monster , " Heavymetalfoes Electrumite ", acts as resource management, being able to recycle Pendulum Monsters from the Extra Deck back to the hand for use as Scales or Summoning, as well as draw power should any  Pendulum Scales  leave the field, allowing players to maintain the number of resources in the hand. Also, since its second effect destroys face-up cards on the field, it can be used to trigger the "Metalfoes" Trap Cards.

 Weaknesses 
 Since "Metalfoes" is a Pendulum-based deck, cards that prevents Special Summons such as " Vanity's Emptiness " and " Vanity's Fiend " can slow their progress. " Anti-Spell Fragrance " can also prevents them from activating any of their Pendulum Effects, along with slowing down their Fusion strategy. " Spell Canceller " can totally cripple the deck. 
 Since their Pendulum Effects revolves around destroying cards in order Set their Spell/Traps, " Magical Spring " can be surprisingly effective against this deck, preventing them from destroying any of their cards in Pendulum Zones, potentially halting them for the entire turn. 
 Banishing  effects also works well against this Deck, specifically against this Deck's " Metalfoes Fusion " to prevent it from recycling itself, as most players usually include only one copy due to the fact that it is easily searchable.
