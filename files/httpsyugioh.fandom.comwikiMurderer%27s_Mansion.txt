 History 
 Seto Kaiba  hired the  Chopman  to manage the Murderer's Mansion attraction at  Death-T , while he was a wanted criminal at large. [2] 
 Yugi  and his friends who had been participating in Death-T, were taken to the mansion on the  Electric Chair Ride . [1] 
 Inside the mansion, while looking for a way out, Yugi found a piece of paper, which seemed to have the word "bllood" on it. A hologram of Kaiba appeared and told them about the Chopman's crimes and that he is hidden in the mansion. Next he directed their attention to four holes, telling them to put their hands inside them. Once in, the players' hands were trapped and they noticed they had put them inside the guillotine. Kaiba left them to solve the  bllood puzzle  to free themselves and find the exit. Yugi managed to solve the puzzle in the nick of time. [1] 
 After the trapdoor opened, the Chopman pulled  Johji  inside and used him as bait to force one of them to fight him in the chamber, while handcuffed together.  Jonouchi  volunteered and managed to beat Chopman, by using a candlestick holder to pick the door and his end of the handcuff's lock, while the Chopman's chainsaw got stuck. Jonouchi used the Chopman's strength against him, by forcing him to rip open the door, which he had fastened his end of the handcuff to. As Jonouchi got out, the candlestick hit the tar on the floor, setting the Chopman alight. [2] 
 The group left the mansion and proceeded to the next stage of Death-T. [3]
