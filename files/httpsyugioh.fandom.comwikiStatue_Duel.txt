 A  Statue Duel  is another way of playing  Duel Monsters  featured in  Yu-Gi-Oh! ZEXAL .  Roku  and  Yuma Tsukumo  engage in one at the  Duel Sanctuary . 
 In this kind of  Duel , both players use Wooden Cards, and use the " Statue "  archetype  of monsters. "Statue" Monsters are based on rare monsters from the  second series anime , and all share the same effect that reduce their  ATK  and  DEF  values to 0 while on the  field . These  effects  are circumvented by their support card, " Statue Zone ", that  negates  such effects. Also, the Duel starts with some cards already placed on the players' field.
