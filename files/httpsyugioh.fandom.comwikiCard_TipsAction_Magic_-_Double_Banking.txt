 This card can be  searched  by " Dark Sage ", " Ancient Gear Drill ", " Alchemic Magician ", " Angmarl the Fiendish Monarch ", " Left Arm Offering ", " Mythical Bestiamorph ", " Spell Calling ", " Quick Booster ", and " Mecha Phantom Beast Jaculuslan ". 
 This card is best used to support monsters whose effects  activate when they destroy a monster by battle , that do not already grant them an extra attack or involve leaving the field as a cost.
 If that effect Special Summons a monster to your field in Attack Position (such as those of " Flamvell Firedog " or " Goyo King "), you can have that monster attack twice in order to regain all advantage lost from activating this card, and gain extra attacks on your opponent. 
 You do not need to control a monster in order to activate this card. The discard cost can lead to a monster that benefits from this card's effect, for example discarding " Gusto Griffin " to summon " Windaar, Sage of Gusto ".
