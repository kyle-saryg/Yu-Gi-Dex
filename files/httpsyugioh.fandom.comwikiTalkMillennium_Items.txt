 Change the card they draw? 
 "In addition to many other abilities, the puzzle is able to allow it's user to change the card they draw at the beginning of their turn to be whatever they desire." Really? I didn't remembered this, but probably I'm wrong. OmarZ 10:11, 3 January 2008 (UTC)
 
 They were referring to the Ceremonial Battle, when Marik commented that Yami could control what cards he was about to draw. But that was nothing to do with the Millennium Puzzle. --  Deltaneos  14:19, 3 January 2008 (UTC) 
 Are they really in gold ? 
 It is really said in the Manga/Anime that their are made of gold ? Their would be very heavy for the poor Yugi ^^ ?
 
 Need To Add: 
 What is happen to a person who holds all of the Millenium Items? 
 Need to mention that all of them (except for the Millenium Key) have the symbol - Eye of Anubis / Millennium Symbol.

 Addition: 
 What's happened to a person when the item isn't accepting him as its owner? - It's mentioned in the Anime that the item must accept him.  87.70.47.165  ( talk ) 04:15, August 6, 2011 (UTC) 
 Feather of Ma'at 
 Is this item actually a Millennium item? I mean sacred yes, but is it actually connected to them in any capacity beyond being magical-ish... -- slave ( command • works )  22:53, October 20, 2013 (UTC)
 
 Millennium Stone 
 Why does the Millennium Stone redirect to this article? It is a totally different item from the Seven Millennium Items.  Scheepybird  ( talk  •  contribs ) 16:23, September 4, 2015 (UTC)
 
 It's where the items were stored. -- MasterMarik  ( talk  •  contribs ) 16:35, September 4, 2015 (UTC) 
 An article for the stone would be fine, though, if someone wants to make it.  Cheesedude  ( talk  •  contribs ) 16:41, September 4, 2015 (UTC) 
 Because no article exists for it and this is the most relevant place to redirect to

 Eighth Key 
 How did they release Zorc without the need of the Nameless Pharaoh's true name, in the manga? It was something totally forgotten.  Scheepybird  ( talk  •  contribs ) 17:17, October 31, 2015 (UTC)
 
 Quantum Cube 
 The dub considers the Quantum Cube an eighth Millennium Item, so should it be added?  Scheepybird  ( talk  •  contribs ) 21:23, February 2, 2017 (UTC)
