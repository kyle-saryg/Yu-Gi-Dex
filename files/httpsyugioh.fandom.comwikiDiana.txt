 Biography 
       Diana and  Apollo   activating  the same card in their respective Duels.     
 When  Kite Tenjo  arrived at the top of tower, Diana told Kite to Duel her if he wanted to rescue  Lulu . She  Fusion Summoned  " Penumbral Keeper " and  activated  its  effect  to  Special Summon  a " Keeper Shield Token ". When Kite brought out " Galaxy-Eyes Cipher Dragon ", Diana activated " Admiration of the Keepers " to  negate  the effects of "Cipher Dragon",  Special Summon  two "Keeper Shield Tokens", and force "Cipher Dragon" to  attack  all "Keeper Shield Tokens" or be  destroyed  at the end of the  Battle Phase . When "Cipher Dragon" destroyed all the "Keeper Shield Tokens", Diana activated the effect of "Penumbral Keeper" to decrease the  ATK  of "Cipher Dragon" and increase her own  LP  by 800. As Diana brought the  ATK  of "Cipher Dragon" down to 600, she wondered if there was any point for it on the field until Kite brought out " Neo Galaxy-Eyes Cipher Dragon ". She then watched as Kite took control of "Moon Protector" and  Tributed  it to bring back the original "Cipher Dragon" with " Galaxy-Eyes Nova ". She panicked as both dragons attacked her  directly , defeating her. [1] 
 When  Shay Obsidian  later made it to the tower to rescue Lulu, Diana was still unconscious on the ground. [2] 
 
 Deck 
 Diana uses a  Deck  centered on  Fusion Summoning  " Penumbral Keeper ". Her strategy revolves around creating " Keeper Shield Tokens " through the  effects  of "Penumbral Keeper" and " Admiration of the Keepers ", which prevents "Penumbral Keeper" from being destroyed. With "Admiration of the Keepers" she's capable of nullifying her opponent's ace  monsters 's effects while forcing them to  attack  the "Shield Tokens" or they risk getting that monster  destroyed , in turn making the opponent's monsters substantially weaker while granting additional benefits for Diana.
