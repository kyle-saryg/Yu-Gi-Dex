 Personality 
 Tsukiko is polite, but quite antisocial, probably due to the overprotective attitude of her brother  Dark Kuroda . She also has a "darker side" she expresses whenever she gets annoyed, like when she told her brother to shut up when he declared he "has to protect her purity at all costs" after losing to  Shoma , or when Shoma was too friendly with  Ms. Guide . Tsukiko is aware of how people may find her "darker side" scary and would try to suppress it in front of people she cares about.
