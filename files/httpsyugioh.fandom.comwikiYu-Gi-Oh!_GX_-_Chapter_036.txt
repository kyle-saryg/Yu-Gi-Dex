 The Shadow Game Ends!! 
 
 " Angel of Darkness!! " is the thirty-sixth chapter of the  Yu-Gi-Oh! GX  manga . It was first printed in Japanese in  V Jump  magazine and in English in  Shonen Jump  magazine. Both of which were printed in  volume 5  of the  Yu-Gi-Oh! GX  graphic novels.
 
 Summary 
 Winged Kuriboh  continues to lead  Jaden Yuki  towards the  Abandoned Dorm , much to the latter's confusion. At that site, the duel between  Reggie MacKenzie  and  Midori Hibiki  continues. Reggie reveals she's drawn " Valhalla, Hall of the Fallen ". She would usually have to  remove  a " Divine Sanctuary " in her  Graveyard  from play to activate it, but she does not have one there. Instead, she  activates  " Light to the Temple ", which permits her to activate "Valhalla" from her  hand . She uses "Valhalla's"  effect  to  Special Summon  " Tethys, Goddess of Light " from her Graveyard, and then uses the effect of " Court of Justice " to Special Summon " Archlord Kristya " from her hand. She attacks  directly  with both  monsters , but Midori activates her  face-down  " Dark Mist ",  discarding  the  Level 5  " Darklord Edeh Arae " and the Level 8 " Darklord Asmodeus " to  negate  both attacks.
 Midori activates " Mystical Space Typhoon " to destroy "Valhalla" and ends her turn. Reggie expected a skilled opponent in Midori, but her strength ended up being much more than she had anticipated. Reggie attacks with "Kristya", but Midori activates her face-down " Darklord Descends ",  paying  half of her  Life Points  to Special Summon two  DARK   attribute ,  Fairy - Type  monsters from her Graveyard with an Level equal to "Kristya's". She Special Summons "Asmodeus" and " Darklord Superbia ", both in Attack Position. Reggie questions how the second Level 8 monster got into her Graveyard, being that "Dark Mist" discarded a Level 5 and a Level 8. She realizes Midori discarded to activate " Prison Flame "  previously . The effect of "Superbia", activates, Special Summoning "Edeh Arae" from her Graveyard. Reggie  replays  her attack,  targeting  "Edeh Arae" instead. Midori moves to activate her face-down card, but finds she's become fatigued due to the Life Point loss. Regardless, she activates " Darklord Bewitching ", switching the attack target to "Asmodeus", who destroys "Kristya". Reggie Summons a second " Divine Spirit Parmal " in Defense Position and switches "Tethys" to Defense Position as well, shocked that she was backed into a corner so easily.
 Midori is put off by the  Shadow Game , realizing her Life Points are her own life. She attacks and destroys "Tethys" with "Asmodeus", while doing the same to "Parmal" with "Superbia". "Edeh Arae" attacks and destroys the second "Parmal" and inflicts  piercing  damage, reducing Reggie to 700 Life Points. Reggie cannot believe she's losing just as  David Rabb  did. She vows to win by any means necessary and make  Tragoedia 's power her own. Reggie tells Midori that she's even more skilled that  Koyo  was. Midori questions when Reggie dueled Koyo, and she responds that it was six years previously, when Koyo won his World Championship in America. Midori asks how can get Koyo to regain consciousness and Reggie responds that such information can't even be found on the internet. Reggie Summons " Zeriel " in Attack Position and ends her turn. Reggie states that should she lose this duel, she'd collapse, and would this be unable to tell Midori anything about Koyo's condition. Wanting to find out more, Midori passes her turn, though she would have won had she attacked. Reggie states that after she defeats Midori, she'll be able to obtain Jaden and  Chazz Princeton 's  spirit   cards , and use their power to make Tragoedia's her own. Reggie uses "Court of Justice" to Special Summon " The Splendid Venus  in Attack Position as the chapter ends.
