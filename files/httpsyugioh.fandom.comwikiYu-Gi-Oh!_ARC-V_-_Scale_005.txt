 Summary 
   This summary is currently incomplete. 
 Yuya  and  Yuzu  arrive to the " Sky Tree Bird Cage " field that  Shun  materialized in the middle of the  Maiami City  suburbs as the site of their  Action Duel . As Yuzu rushes off upon spotting her  father  hanging from a branch, Yuya and Shun commence their midair duel. As Shun summons " Raidraptor - Napalm Dragonius ",  Yuto  notes their opponent would have most likely analyzed Yuya's dueling state and warns his counterpart not to underestimate their opponent. But Yuya refuses to accept Yuto's advice as a  Dueltainer  as he summons  Enter-Mates  " Uni " and " Corn ", Yuzu expressing some annoyance in Yuya's choice of monsters. Yuya then uses the two Odd-Eyes cards that he placed on his  Pendulum Scale  to  Pendulum Summon  " Odd-Eyes Phantom Dragon " and use its effect to inflict damage on Shun's Life Points. But Yuya and Yuto were caught off guard by Shun expressing delight in the pain he is experiencing from his Life Points dwindling.
 
 Featured Duel: Yuya Sakaki vs. Shun Kurosaki 
 At the start of the Duel, the  Field Spell Card  " Sky Tree Bird Cage " is activated, as per the rules of an  Action Duel .
 Turn 1: Shun 
 Yuya  attempts to catch an  Action Card , but  Shun   Normal Summons  " Raidraptor - Napalm Dragonius " (1000/1000) and  activates  its  effect  to inflict 600 damage to Yuya (Yuya: 4000 → 3400 LP). With that, Shun prevents Yuya from getting the Action Card and obtains it himself instead. He  Sets  1 card.
 Turn 2: Yuya 
Yuya gets an Action Card, but Shun activates the Action Card he had obtained earlier, " Sky Fall ",  destroying  Yuya's Action Card and inflicting 300 damage (Yuya: 3400 → 3100 LP). Yuya Normal Summons " Enter-Mate Uni " (800/1500) and activates her effect,  Special Summoning  " Enter-Mate Corn " (600/1000). Since he  controls  both "Uni" and "Corn", Yuya activates the latter's effect, switching both to  Defense Position  to  add  " Odd-Eyes Mirage Dragon " from his  Deck  to his  hand . Yuya activates " Odd-Eyes Persona Dragon " ( PS : 1) and "Odd-Eyes Mirage Dragon" (PS: 8) in his  Pendulum Zones . Yuya  Pendulum Summons  " Odd-Eyes Phantom Dragon " (2500/2000) in Attack Position. "Phantom Dragon"  attacks  "Napalm Dragonius", but Shun activates his  face-down  " Raidraptors Replica ", creating a copy of "Napalm Dragonius" that takes the attack instead (Shun: 4000 → 2500 LP). Since "Phantom Dragon" inflicted  battle damage  during the  turn  it was Pendulum Summoned, its effect activates, inflicting damage to Shun equal to the combined  ATK  of the "Mirage" and "Persona" Dragons in his Pendulum Zones (Shun: 2500 → 100 LP).
 Duel continues in the next Scale .
