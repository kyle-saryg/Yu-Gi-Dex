 Through Twitter, Ono has answered many questions about the  Yu-Gi-Oh! 5D's  anime. These include:
 
 The motif for  Red Nova  and his smoking mirror are the Aztec deity  Tezcatlipoca . [2] 
 The name  Crow Hogan  (クロウ・ホーガン,  Kurō Hōgan ) is a based on the title Kuro Hogan (九郎判官,  Kurō Hōgan ) held by  General Yoshitsune . [3] 
 The  head of security  during  Kalin Kessler 's arrest is the chief who is seen speaking to  Tetsu Trudge  in  episode 2 . [4] 
 The tail  Mark of the Dragon  is a mask; when  Yusei  had the mark replaced with the Head, it was a metaphorical shattering of the mask. [5] 
 Leo 's heart Mark of the Dragon is based on hearts in Mayan and Aztec sacrifices to the Gods, which were eaten. [6] 
 Sherry LeBlanc 's  Duel Runner  is called  Sturm und Drang . [7] 
 Aporia 's Duel Runner is called  Trinidart Ouroboros  and Mr. Uchiyama from set production comes up with these names. [8] 
 The faces on the " Timelords " are those of angels. The bodies are metal suits of armor being manipulated by the angel whose face it contains. [9] 
 The time while  Z-one  was fully organic is about 200 years later than the present days events of  Yu-Gi-Oh! 5D's . [10] 
 He considers  Yliadus  to be the souls of  Z-one ,  Antinomy ,  Paradox ,  Aporia  and many other people who are asleep within the  Ark Cradle  who are no longer of this world. [11] 
 It had always planned that Leo would become a  Signer , since design of the Marks of the Dragon began. [12] 
 " Aporia " and " Z-one " are code names. [13] 
 Plans for more in-depth coverage of items on  Z-one 's data screen in  episode 149 , such as " Cosmic Blazar Dragon " and the  Pegasus J. Crawford Cup Trinidad Riding Duel Grand Prix , had not precisely been decided on, at the time. [14] 
 Bruno  did not have his own room in  Poppo Time , but lived in the second floor living room. [15] 
 The statue of three people seen at the beginning of  episode 152  represents the three  Turbo Duelists  of  Team 5D's  who protected the city. The statue holding up the pedestal represents how the trio support the city and its people. [15] 
 About half a year passes between  episode 151  and  152 . [16] 
 The future events of  episode 154  are set eight years after its present day events.  Leo  and  Luna  are 21 [17]  and Jack is 29 years old in the future events. [18] 
 The present days events of  Yu-Gi-Oh! 5D's  take place over two to three years. Yusei is 18 at the beginning and 20 at the end. [19] 
 The events of  The Enforcers  take place three years before the present-day events. [20] 
 Yusei meeting  Paradox  happened just before the  Crash Town  events. [21] 
 Yusei deciding to  fuse   Synchro Monsters  was a result of his meeting with  Jaden  and  Yugi , having seen Jaden perform Fusion Summons and Yugi Summoning " Dark Magician ", one of the monsters on " Speed Spell - Speed Fusion ". [22]
