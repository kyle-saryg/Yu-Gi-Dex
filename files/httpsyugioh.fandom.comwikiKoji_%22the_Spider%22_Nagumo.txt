 Nagumo is a gamer with interest in a variety of games, ranging from  Monster Fighter  to  Duel Monsters . He engages in games to make money and often focuses on the potential resale value of desirable collectibles, including  Monster Fighter  figures and " Obelisk the Tormentor ".

 Biography 
 Yu-Gi-Oh! 
 Battle City 
 Nagumo first appears as a participant in the Battle City Tournament. He had just defeated an opponent, but was unhappy with the card he has won through the  ante rule  after one of his Duels. He demanded that his opponent give also him his second rarest card.
 However,  Mokuba Kaiba  appeared and calls a foul for changing the ante. Koji insulted Mokuba, calling him “Junior”. However  Seto Kaiba  appears behind him and told Nagumo off, saying that speaking rudely to Mokuba dishonors Kaiba and the Battle City tournament. Kaiba challenged him to a Duel, anteing a briefcase full of rare cards, which excited Nagumo. He allowed Koji to use the cards from the briefcase in the Duel, but said he would take them back after he won. Koji, overconfident at his newly empowered Deck, suffered a devastating defeat as Kaiba unleashed “ Obelisk the Tormentor ”, and took his  Locator Cards . Koji was left traumatized by Obelisk’s overwhelming power, and wound up screaming in terror as he relived the image of the God crushing him.
 During the finals, Nagumo observed the fight between  Yugi  and Kaiba from television screen in  Domino City , along with the other Duelists that had been eliminated from the tournament.
