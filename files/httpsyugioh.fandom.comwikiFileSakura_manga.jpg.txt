 Sakura gave  Akiza  a towel after her Duel with  Ran Kobayakawa . Akiza thanks her and Sakura was delighted that Akiza remembered her name. [1] 
 Sakura and Mei go to  Satellite  with Akiza. Here they bump into  Yusei Fudo . When Mei comments that Yusei's  Duel Runner  looks worn-out, Sakura tells her that she is being rude, but calls it "rugged", after struggling to find a nicer term. Mei and Sakura are both shocked when Akiza challenges Yusei to a  One-Shot Run . Although Akiza wins, they are surprised to see that Yusei breaks one of her crests. [2] 
 When Akiza announces that they are returning to  the city , Sakura is confused as to why Akiza didn't ask Yusei about  Jack . Akiza explains that she touched Yusei's  Sense , which was enough to tell her what kind of Turbo Duel he had with Jack. [2]
