I think that Bonz shouldnt be under minor he makes more appearances then Espa roba.
 
 Main Characters 
 i think duke devlin should be added as a main character since he appears in every story arc frequently after his introduction, and he was a main character in the manga. DalekSupreme13  ( talk  •  contribs ) 02:34, January 5, 2012 (UTC)
 
 Reverting 
 I don't think Mythic Dragon/FGD is a character at all. Can't most of the "character" stuff for "Blue-Eyes" be covered with  Kisara ? As for "Red-Eyes", I'd say that's debatable too.  Cheesedude  ( talk  •  contribs ) 10:26, January 14, 2012 (UTC)
