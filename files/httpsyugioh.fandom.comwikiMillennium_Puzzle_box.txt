      The Millennium Puzzle box     
 The  Millennium Puzzle box  is a container, which  Yugi Mutou  kept the disassembled  Millennium Puzzle  in until he had recompleted it.
 
 History 
 Sugoroku Mutou  believed the hieroglyphics on the box read "The one who solves me shall gain the powers and knowledge of darkness." Yugi believed they said something along the lines of "Whoever solves this puzzle shall be granted one wish." and wished for friends. He brought the puzzle with him everywhere, usually keeping it inside the box, and spent eight years trying to solve it. [1] 
 One day at school,  Katsuya Jonouchi  and  Hiroto Honda  overheard Yugi talking about the box. They took the box and teasing him over it, with Jonouchi taking a piece, without him noticing. Yugi got the box back when  Anzu Mazaki  intervened. [1] 
 When Yugi solved the puzzle, he kept the box to store prized possessions such as cards.  Time Wizard  was one special card kept here later given to Joey.
 The box appears in the artwork of  Gold Sarcogphagus  and in  episode 224  Yugi uses it in his final duel with  Yami Yugi  as a key component of his victory, effectively ending their relationship where it began; with the Millennium Puzzle Box.
 
 Real Life 
 The design of the Millennium Puzzle box became a popular motif for Yu-Gi-Oh! merchandise. The packaging for  Yugi's Legendary Decks  was directly based off of it.
