Yugi accepts, and when the duel begins, they use a special variation called the "Bingo Rule," which prevents the used of a specific card in each player's deck. Kaiba seems to be himself, but plays a different trump card, the " Automatic Giant ". 
 Mokuba  stumbles in on them, and tells Yugi that Kaiba has not yet awoken from his catatonic state. It turns out that the Kaiba that Yugi is playing against is a  Cyber Kaiba , controlled by the KaibaCorp computer, and using all of Kaiba's memories. 
 
Yugi defeats the "Automatic Giant" and Kaiba with a card called " The Unknown Egg ".
