 X  (エックス,  Ekkusu  (also known as  Howard X Miller  in the English dub) is a  Pro Duelist  hired by the  Society of Light  to duel Jaden, outranking  Aster Phoenix  in the  Pro League  (in the dub, he is Sartorius' lawyer, and claims he dreamed of being a pastry chef when he was a child). He successfully reduces the cards in  Jaden Yuki 's Deck to zero (twice), but ironically loses when he's unable to  draw  due to the effect of the " Neo-Spacian Glow Moss " that Jaden Summoned on X's field, causing him to  Deck Out  instead of Jaden.

 Voices/Mannerisms 
 In the English dub, his voice seems to be a parody/homage to  Paul Lynde . His name is meant to be a pun in English, as mill (a term borrowed from  Magic: The Gathering ) denotes a direct disruption of a player's Deck. In the dub, he constantly makes court references such as "objection" when he activates a  Trap Card .
 
 Etymology 
 His English last name, Miller, is a pun on his playing style,  Mill .
 
 Deck 
 As his name suggests, Howard runs a  Mill Deck , which focuses on emptying his opponents'  Decks , causing them to  Deck Out  and automatically lose. His strategy relies primarily on " Trap Sluzer " and " Monster Register ", a combo that demolishes the Deck of his opponent, but leaves him virtually immune, while various  Spell  and  Trap Cards  are used to  stall  his opponents and protect this combo.
