 Summary 
       Trey  and  Quinton  prepare themselves.     
 Quinton  tells  Trey  he'll bet everything on  Yuma 's gift of believing in others.  Mizar  appears before them and asks where Yuma and  Kite  have gone. Quinton responds that he'll have to defeat them to find out (these events are cut from the dub, as they took place in the previous episode; the dub instead created its own recap of that episode). Mizar boasts that he'll crush their " Numbers " with his " Chaos Number 107: Neo Galaxy-Eyes Tachyon Dragon " as he glows with pink energy and the dragon appears behind him. Quinton muses that it's a strange twist of fate that they'll fight another " Galaxy-Eyes " user like Kite (in the dub, Quinton says this is bad news for Mizar). Mizar questions what he means and Quinton responds that he was the one who taught Kite how to  Duel  and made him who he is today - meaning he is an opponent worth beating. Mizar seems intrigued, but decides he'll kill two birds with one stone. Quinton asks if he plans to Duel them both (in the dub, Quinton says Mizar's ego will be getting a rude awakening) and Trey adds that he's underestimating them. Raising his arm and clasping his fist, Mizar tells them they are sorely mistaken if they think either of them will be a match for his "Neo Tachyon" (in the dub, Mizar says, "Enough talk. Let us have some fun!"). He commences  Barian Battlemorph , while Quinton says "let's go  Michael ". They arm their  D-Pads  and manifest their  Duel Gazer  tattoos as Mizar finishes transforming. The three yell "Duel!"
 
         Don Thousand  makes  Girag  and  Alito   Vector 's puppets.     
 On a rooftop somewhere,  Vector  meets with  Girag  and  Alito . Girag asks Vector what he's talking about, telling him to trick  Nash  into going back to the  Barian World . Vector muses that they can't take on both Nash and Yuma at once (in the dub, Vector says Nash should rule the Barian World instead of Dueling). Girag asks what he means, but Vector ignores him and tells Alito to go after Yuma. Girag tells Vector to give him a break and Alito asks why they'd still be listening to Vector. Vector chuckles and asks them who they think woke them up from their "nap". Alito angrily asks what he's talking about (in the dub, Alito complains about Vector's attitude). Vector turns and asks if he'll have to give them another "juice-up" before they stop being useless and then yells " Don Thousand !" (in the dub, Vector says his allies will like his attitude better after speaking to a friend of his, Don Thousand). Girag and Alito look confused, but Thousand materializes out of black mist behind them, laughing. They back away, but Thousand grasps them both by the neck and says he'll give them a taste of his power and dark energy flows through them both. Alito calls Vector a fool for resurrecting Thousand (in the dub, he adds that Don Thousand will destroy them all), but  the god's emblem  emanates out and the two stand there, blank-faced. Vector cackles and says they'll be his puppets now, telling them to get to work. 
 
       Cathy  and  Caswell  tearfully explain the situation to  Yuma 's family.     
 At Yuma's  house ,  Cathy  and  Caswell  have explained the situation to  Kari  and  Haru . They have just told them that Yuma went to another universe to save the world. Kari is dumbfounded and Cathy clarifies that Yuma told she and Caswell not to tell his family anything (in the dub, Cathy and Caswell hope that Yuma will keep his promise for being back for breakfast). Cathy and Caswell are both holding back tears, which seems to convince Kari this is legitimate. Calling Yuma an idiot ("that little dweeb" in the dub), she runs to the door, her slippers flying off. Haru asks where she thinks she's going. Kari begins to explain, but Haru says she heard the first time and that Yuma told them not to worry, so they shouldn't. Kari calls him going to another universe ridiculous (in the dub, Kari doubts that Yuma is right and wonders if he will not be coming home). Tears streaming down her face, Cathy tells them that Yuma promised he'd come back safe, with Caswell adding "no matter what", his face also covered in tears. Haru says they'll trust him and just wait (in the dub, Haru adds that Kari can't protect Yuma forever), then thinks she'll prepare some Duel rice for when he gets back. Kari looks towards the pillar of energy and the portal from the Barian World. 
 At the same time, the  Different Dimension Airship  is streaming through a dimensional portal and Kari tells Yuma she believes in him. Aboard the ship,  Astral  asks Yuma if he's thinking about Trey and Quinton. Yuma turns towards him and  Tori  and confirms this. Yuma says he's upset about the fight they had. He understands why they'd want revenge for  Quattro , but knows that nothing comes from Dueling when one is angry and that he wanted to tell them that. Tori mutter's Yuma's name, while Astral responds that though Yuma may think otherwise, what they did was the right path for them. Tori agrees - everyone can only take the path they think is right, even if they don't know where that path will take them. She recalls Yuma's encounter with  the Door , his first boarding the airship to fight Vector and his trip to the  Astral World . Yuma says that makes sense, while Astral turns his head and silently thinks of Trey and Quinton (in the dub, Astral wonders what they are doing is the right decision). 
 
         Dumon  and  Marin  head towards the Duel.     
 As Mizar faces off with Trey and Quinton, he tells them they'll be sharing  Life Points . Quinton says that's fine, but it will also mean they'll go first. He turns to Trey and says he'll take the first  turn  they get, Trey will take the next. Trey agrees and Quinton begins,  drawing  " Deep-Space Cruiser IX ". He immediately  activates  its  effect , explaining that he can  send  another  Machine - Type   monster  in his  hand  to the  Graveyard  to  Special Summon  this card. He says he has one more Machine-Type monster. He flings it into the Graveyard portal - another copy of "Deep-Space Cruiser IX". The first copy appears in  Attack Position . He then activates " Monster Reborn ", letting him Special Summon the copy he sent to the Graveyard. It flies from the Graveyard portal and Quinton declares he's  overlaying  his two  Level  9 monsters to  Xyz Summon  " Number 9: Dyson Sphere " in Attack Position. 
 Mizar remarks his "Number" has shown up as "Dyson Sphere" blots out much of the sky (in the dub, Mizar comments on the monster's size).  Dumon  and  Marin  are flying through the sky at high speeds and see "Dyson Sphere" suddenly cover much of the cityscape. Dumon simply says "Dyson Sphere...", while Marin remarks that a Duel seems to have started (in the dub, Dumon says he cannot believe what he is seeing, while Marin believes what she is seeing and hopes she will not go against it). Quinton activates " Spell Summon Stopper ", explaining that this will prevent Mizar was  Normal Summoning ,  Setting  or Special Summoning monsters via the effects of a  Spell Card  during the next turn. Mizar grunts and Quinton says they analyzed the Duel Data that their brother,  Thomas  sent them about the  Seven Barian Emperors . He remarks that their key card is " Rank-Up-Magic - The Seventh One ". Mizar is intrigued that they seem to be trying to stop him from bringing out "Neo Tachyon". Quinton ends his turn by Setting two cards. 
 
         The brothers trap the  Barians  with a  Sphere Field .     
 Dumon and Marin arrive, streaming through the air and landing next to Mizar. Dumon asks Mizar who his opponents are and Marin responds that they are Trey and Quinton, two powerful  "Number" holders  (Dumon's and Marin's lines are cut from the dub). Trey says they have three of the seven Emperors here and Quinton remarks that there are four others (in the dub, Trey asks if the other two Emperors are here to watch the Duel, while Quinton thinks the stage is set for him and Trey to proceed). Mizar tells the two Emperors he's fine here and that they should pursue Yuma and Kite. Dumon agrees, but Trey suggests they act now. Quinton remarks that he wanted to wait for all seven to show up (in the dub, Quinton asks if the two Emperors are leaving soon; they just got here), but he and Trey both activate their bracelets'  crests . Blue light radiate out from both of them and a blue  Sphere Field  generates around the surrounding area. Quinton says they'll have to stay a little longer. Dumon remarks they appear to be trapped. Above them, Vector stands on an aerial platform. He remarks they pulled out a "bad field" (in the dub, Vector says the Arclights pulled out another mouse trap, perfect for catching rats like Dumon and Marin) and muses that he'll treat himself and watch the proceedings from here. Mizar tells Dumon and Marin not to interfere - he can defeat these two no matter what tricks they have. He sees they aim to seal "The Seventh One" (in the dub, Mizar thanks Quinton for trapping his comrades here to provide an audience for the Duel and promises to give them a show by defeating his opponents). 
 
         Girag tricks  Nash  into returning to the  Barian World .     
 Mizar begins his turn by drawing " Schwarzschild Limit Dragon " and immediately Special Summoning it. He explains he can do so when his opponent has a monster with 2000 or more  ATK  on the  field . He then activates " Ergosphere " which lets him  add  a "Schwarzschild" from his  Deck  to his hand if he already  controls  one. He does so, then Special Summons it as well. He boasts he'll show them the power of a real "Galaxy-Eyes" and overlays his two Level 8 monsters to Xyz Summon " Number 107: Galaxy-Eyes Tachyon Dragon " in Attack Position. Trey seems pleased to see his "Galaxy-Eyes" (in the dub, Trey remarks the Duel has gotten tough), while Quinton simply stares. On a nearby rooftop, Nash sees "Dyson Sphere" and determines a Duel has started. Girag appears behind him and informs him that they have a problem. Nash asks what's wrong and Girag explains that Yuma and his allies are no longer on  Earth  - they are heading to the Barian World. Nash angrily recites Yuma's name, but then tells Girag to return to the Barian World, vanishing through a portal himself. Girag remarks that he'd better hurry, his eyes glowing red with Thousand's power. 
 
         " Dyson Sphere " drained of its  effects .     
 Mizar orders "Tachyon Dragon" to attack "Dyson Sphere" with " Tachyon Spiral of Destruction ". Quinton tells him his attack his useless and activates the effect of "Dyson Sphere",  negating  the attack as "Dyson Sphere" has  Overlay Units . The spiral dissipates, but Mizar activates the effect of "Tachyon Dragon",  detaching  an Overlay Unit to negate the effects of all other  face-up  monsters. "Tachyon Dragon" reverts to its sealed form and Mizar yells " Tachyon Transmigration ". Rainbow energy flies out and all the panels on "Dyson Sphere" go dark as its effects are negated. Mizar reveals that for each card effect his opponent used during the  Battle Phase , "Tachyon Dragon" gains 1000 ATK. With the effect of "Dyson Sphere" used, the ATK of "Tachyon Dragon" rises by 1000. "Dyson Sphere" fires a beam at "Tachyon Dragon" and it begins to unfold into a dragon again. Mizar orders it to slip back through space-time and reappear. Trey remarks that it gained ATK, but the Battle Phase should be over. Mizar tells them that "Tachyon Transmigration" allows it to attack again. 
 Quinton yells "What!", while Dumon remarks that this is the true terror of "Tachyon Dragon", with Marin adding that it is able to go back in time and choose a future that benefits it (Dumon's and Marin's quotes are cut from the dub). Mizar says that "Tachyon Transmigration" has negated the effects of "Dyson Sphere" and yells "Tachyon Spiral of Destruction". This time, the burst lances through the core of "Dyson Sphere" and small explosions radiate all over the panels. The brothers are both thrown off their feet, screaming as their Life Points fall to 2800. Mizar believes now that "Tachyon Dragon" should be enough to deal with them; he won't even need to bring out "Neo Tachyon" (in the dub, Mizar taunts the brothers by asking if they've had enough, then answering it in the positive himself). He Sets two cards and ends his turn. As it's the  End Phase , the ATK of "Tachyon Dragon" returns to 3000. Elsewhere, Kite speeds through the city on  Orbital 7 's bike form, his vision still blurred. Orbital says "Dyson Sphere" has disappeared and wonders how Quinton and Trey are doing. Kite tells him not to lose his head over it - those two need to do what they need to do, even if it kills them. He remarks that they are the same - they must do what they must do as well. He orders Orbital not to look back and the robot responds with "Roger!"
 
         Trey's  crest  takes its toll as he performs a  Rank-Up .     
 Quinton smiles, remarking that the power of "Tachyon Dragon" makes it worth beating (in the dub, Quinton remarks that its power is "annoying"). Mizar asks if he thinks they can beat it and Trey says they'll beat it no matter what. He begins his turn by drawing " Chronomaly Gordian Knot " and Normal Summoning it. Its effect activates when its Summoned, letting Trey Special Summon a " Chronomaly " monster with 1000 or less ATK from his hand with its effects negated, while also changing the Level of "Gordian Knot" to that of the Summoned monster. He Special Summons " Chronomaly Sol Monolith ", which glows as "Gordian Knot" becomes Level 6. Trey overlays his two Level 6 monsters to Xyz Summon " Number 6: Chronomaly Atlandis " in Attack Position. 
 Mizar calls this an interesting "Number" (in the dub, Mizar bitterly mutters this "Number" will not save the Arclights) and Trey tells him that when it's Summoned, he can  equip  it with a "Number" monster in the Graveyard. Quinton says "Dyson Sphere" is in the Graveyard and it appears overhead in a portal. Trey says "Atlandis" will gain ATK equal to that of "Dyson Sphere", giving it 5400 total. Mizar says "denied" ("I'm not going to let that happen!" in the dub) and activates his face-down " Tachyon Flare Wing ", revealing that he can equip it to a "Galaxy-Eyes" monster when his opponent Xyz Summons a monster. "Tachyon Dragon" gains a set of orange wings and Mizar continues, saying the effects of the opponent's Xyz Monster will be negated. The portal fades and "Dyson Sphere" vanishes. Trey asks if he'd like to guess again and Quinton says they knew he would do that. Mizar yells "What!" ("Your...hands?" in the dub) and Quinton tells Trey to use his face-down card. Trey says he understands and activates it - " Rank-Up-Magic Argent Chaos Force ". Trey's crest glows with green energy, with covers his body. Fire streams out from "Atlandis" and Mizar calls the two "curs" (in the dub, Mizar did not say anything at this point). Trey grunts in pain, but  Ranks-Up  "Atlandis" and performs a  Chaos Xyz Evolution . He chants "shatter the limited space-time continuum and engrave your existence into the whole of creation, now!" " Chaos Number 6: Chronomaly Chaos Atlandis " appears in Attack Position and Dumon seems shocked that they have their own " Rank-Up-Magic ". 
 
         " Tachyon Flare Wing " protects " Tachyon Dragon ", or so  Mizar  thinks.     
 Trey orders "Chaos Atlandis" to attack with " Chaos Punishment ". Its volcano erupts and lava streams towards "Tachyon Dragon". Mizar says "denied" again ("In your dreams, little boy!" in the dub) and reveals that he can send "Tachyon Flare Wing" to the Graveyard to prevent the equipped monster's  destruction by battle . The orange wings vanish and a bubble shield covers "Tachyon Dragon", though the flaming rocks still bounce off of it and reduce Mizar to 3700 Life Points. Mizar remarks that the odds are just not in their favor (in the dub, Mizar says "Tachyon Dragon" will not be destroyed, no matter what the Arclights do). Trey claims he was waiting for this. With "Tachyon Flare Wing" gone, "Chaos Atlandis" can use its effects again. He reveals that after it  battles  a monster, he can equip that monster to it. He orders "Chaos Atlandis" to rob him of "Tachyon Dragon" and the former reduces the latter to rock with a flaming whip. Mizar is concerned for his dragon and the whip snares it, pulling it in and lodging it in the volcano on the the left shoulder of "Chaos Atlandis". Trey says its ATK rises by 1000 for each monster equipped to it. Mizar is furious and Marin can't believe they managed it. Dumon says they had it planned from the beginning - "Tachyon Flare Wing" ended up being a hindrance in the end (in the dub, Dumon says the brothers' plan was to steal Mizar's "Galaxy-Eyes"). 
 
         Mizar  draws  a card he cannot play.     
 Mizar clasps his fist, visibly shaking in anger. Calling them "curs", ("you little thieves" in the dub) he says they'd be the first to ever make him taste humiliation. Trey thanks him for the compliment (in the dub, Trey says this Duel was easier than he thought) and Sets two cards to end his turn. As Mizar moves to draw, he says this won't entrap him. Glowing with pink energy, he declares " Chaos Draw ". He reveals he's drawn "The Seventh One" and explains it will let him Rank-Up his "Tachyon Dragon" whenever he wants. He stops short and stares at "Tachyon Dragon" entombed in "Atlandis". He now realizes what their intention was all along. Quinton says that "The Seventh One" can Summon and Rank Up an " Over-Hundred Number " from the  Extra Deck  or  Graveyard  - but that isn't where "Tachyon Dragon" is right now. Trey says they beat his monster without destroying it, so he cannot fill it with chaos, calling it the only flaw in the armor of the "The Seventh One" (in the dub, Trey asks Mizar if he knows why, then answers the question himself: Trey and Quinton stole "Tachyon Dragon" from Mizar). Mizar finally realizes their plan from the very beginning was to prevent him from ever Summoning "Neo Tachyon" to begin with. Up above, Vector chides Mizar, calling him "Miza-chan" (in the dub, Vector taunts Mizar with "you just got schooled, fool!") and remarking that he may not be as good as he thinks he is. Mizar is still shaking with anger. Quinton says his wings are essentially plucked and wonders what he'll do next (in the dub, Mizar chides his opponents for thinking they've angered him, but all he can feel is pity for them; this will lead to their defeat at his hands; Quinton's line is also cut).
 
 Featured Duel: Mizar vs. Trey & Quinton 
 Quinton  and  Trey  share a  field  and 4000  Life Points , while  Mizar  takes every second  turn .
 Turn 1: Quinton 
 
         Mizar  vs.  Trey  and  Quinton .     
 Quinton  draws  " Deep-Space Cruiser IX ". He then  sends  another copy of "Deep-Space Cruiser IX" (a  Machine - Type   monster ) from his  hand  to the  Graveyard  in order to  Special Summon  "Deep-Space Cruiser IX" ( 9/900/900) in  Attack Position . Quinton then activates " Monster Reborn " to revive his second "Deep-Space Cruiser IX" ( 9/900/900) in Attack Position. He then  overlays  his two copies of "Deep-Space Cruiser IX" in order to  Xyz Summon  " Number 9: Dyson Sphere " ( 9/2800/3000, ORU: 2) in Attack Position. Quinton then activates " Spell Summon Stopper ", which will prevent Mizar from  Normal Summoning , Special Summoning or  Setting  a monster with the effect of a  Spell Card  during his next turn. Quinton Sets two cards (one of which is " Rank-Up Return ").
 
         " Dyson Sphere " is  destroyed .     
 Turn 2: Mizar 
Mizar draws " Schwarzschild Limit Dragon ". As Quinton  controls  a monster with 2000 or more  ATK , Mizar Special Summons "Schwarzschild Limit Dragon" ( 8/2000/0) in Attack Position via its own effect. As he controls a "Schwarzschild Limit Dragon", Mizar activates " Ergosphere " to  add  another copy of "Schwarzschild Limit Dragon" from his  Deck  to his hand. He then Special Summons the second "Schwarzschild Limit Dragon" ( 8/2000/0) in Attack Position via its own effect. Mizar overlays his two copies of "Schwarzschild Limit Dragon" in order to Xyz Summon " Number 107: Galaxy-Eyes Tachyon Dragon " ( 8/3000/2500, ORU: 2) in Attack Position. 
 "Galaxy-Eyes Tachyon Dragon" attacks "Dyson Sphere", but Quinton activates the second effect of "Dyson Sphere" to negate the attack (as it has  Overlay Units ). Mizar activates the effect of "Galaxy-Eyes Tachyon Dragon" to detach a "Schwarzschild Limit Dragon",  negate the effects of all other face-up monsters on the field, increase the ATK of "Galaxy-Eyes Tachyon Dragon" by 1000 for each card effect that  resolved  during this  Battle Phase  except for its own ("Galaxy-Eyes Tachyon Dragon": 3000 → 4000 ATK), and allow it to attack again. "Galaxy-Eyes Tachyon Dragon" attacks and  destroys  "Dyson Sphere" (Trey and Quinton: 4000 → 2800 LP). Mizar Sets two cards. On Mizar's End Phase, the effect of "Galaxy-Eyes Tachyon Dragon" expires ("Galaxy-Eyes Tachyon Dragon": 4000 → 3000 ATK).
 Turn 3: Trey 
 
         " Chaos Number 6: Chronomaly Chaos Atlandis " is Summoned.     
 Trey's hand contains " Orichalcum Chain ". He then draws " Chronomaly Gordian Knot " and subsequently Normal Summons it ( 3/300/900) in Attack Position. As it was Normal Summoned, Trey activates the effect of "Chronomaly Gordian Knot" to Special Summon " Chronomaly Sol Monolith " ( 6/600/600) (a " Chronomaly " monster with 1000 or less ATK) in Attack Position with its effects negated. The effect of "Chronomaly Gordian Knot" then changes its Level to that of the Summoned monster ("Chronomaly Gordian Knot":   3 → 6). Trey overlays "Chronomaly Gordian Knot" and "Chronomaly Sol Monolith" in order to Xyz Summon " Number 6: Chronomaly Atlandis " ( 6/2600/3000, ORU: 2) in Attack Position. 
 Trey activates the second effect of "Chronomaly Atlandis" to  equip  "Dyson Sphere" (a " Number " monster) from his Graveyard to it, but Mizar activates his  face-down  " Tachyon Flare Wing " (as his opponent Special Summoned a monster), which equips to "Galaxy-Eyes Tachyon Dragon" (a " Galaxy-Eyes " monster) and negates the effects of face-up Xyz monsters controlled by Trey and Quinton.
 Trey activates Quinton's face-down " Rank-Up-Magic Argent Chaos Force " to  Rank-Up  "Chronomaly Atlandis" via  Chaos Xyz Evolution  in order to Xyz Summon " Chaos Number 6: Chronomaly Chaos Atlandis " ( 7/3300/3300, ORU: 3) in Attack Position. "Chronomaly Chaos Atlandis" attacks "Galaxy-Eyes Tachyon Dragon", but Mizar activates the second effect of "Tachyon Flare Wing" to send it to the Graveyard and prevent the destruction of "Galaxy-Eyes Tachyon Dragon" (Mizar: 4000 → 3700 LP). Trey activates the third effect of "Chronomaly Chaos Atlandis" to equip the attacked monster to it after  damage calculation  and increase its ATK by 1000 ("Chronomaly Chaos Atlandis": 3300 → 4300 ATK). Trey Sets two cards.
 Turn 4: Mizar 
Mizar's hand contains " Heliosphere Dragon " and " Damage Rebound ". Mizar performs a  Chaos Draw  and gets " Rank-Up-Magic - The Seventh One ".
 Duel continues in  the next episode .
