 Lyrics (TV Size) 
 Kanji Kana Romaji English 
 
 今日もテストが難しい　娯楽誘惑断ち切れない 
帰ってテレビを見ていたい　最近アニメが面白い 
 
とにかくテストが難しい　国・数・英 が特にズイ 
理科と社会も平均点　得意なのは体育くらい 
 
(待ちなよ Baby!)　望まれた 
(それって Baby!)　解答を 
(ちょっと待った Baby!)　覚えるのは 
(オレたちゃなんだ!? Baby!)　誰の為に 
 
例えばその紙に正解を書けたとして 
1年先　10年先　変わる? 
 
夢の片隅で描いた世界で 
いつか僕は大空を駆ける 
誰もこの心を咎めないよ 
何が正しいなんて無い!
 
 
 
 きょうもテストがむずかしい　ごらくゆうわくたちきれない 
かえってテレビをみていたい　さいきんアニメがおもしろい 
 
とにかくテストがむずかしい　こくすうえいがとくにムズイ 
りかとしゃかいもへいきんてん　とくいなのはたいいくくらい 
 
(まちなよ ベイベー!)　のぞまれた 
(それって ベイベー!)　かいとうを 
(ちょっとまった ベイベー!)　おぼえるのは 
(オレたちゃなんだ!? ベイベー!)　だれのために 
 
たとえばそのかみにせいかいをかけたとして 
1ねんさき　10ねんさき　かわる? 
 
ゆめのかたすみでえがいたせかいで 
いつかぼくはおおぞらをかける 
だれもこのこころをとがめないよ 
なにがただしいなんてない!
 
 
 
 Kyō mo tesuto ga muzukashī goraku yūwaku tachi kirenai 
Kaette terebi wo miteitai saikin anime ga omoshiroi 
 
Tonikaku tesuto ga muzukashī koku sū ei ga toku ni muzui 
Rika to shakai mo heikinten tokui na no wa taiiku kurai 
 
(Machi na yo beibē!) Nozomareta 
(Sorette beibē!) Kaitō wo 
(Chotto matta beibē!) Oboeru no wa 
(Oretacha nanda!? beibē!) Dare no tame ni 
 
Tatoeba sono kami ni seikai wo kaketa to shite 
Ichi-nen saki, jū-nen saki kawaru? 
 
Yume no katasumi de egaita sekai de 
Itsuka boku wa ōzora wo kakeru 
Dare mo kono kokoro wo togamenai yo 
Nani ga tadashī nante nai!
 
 
 
 Today's test is hard, I can't divide myself from pleasure and temptation. 
I wanna watch TV when I get home. The recent anime are fun. 
 
In any case, this test is hard. Geography, Math and English are especially bad. 
I'm only average at sciences and social studies. The only thing I'm good at is P.E. 
 
(Wait up, BABY!) For who's sake 
(That's it, BABY!) Was I remembering 
(Just hold on, BABY!) The answer 
(What are we!? BABY!) They wanted. 
 
Even if I write the correct answer on this paper 
In one year, in ten years, will anything change? 
 
In the world I drew in the corner of my dreams 
One day I will race through the open sky. 
No one can blame this heart of mine. 
Nothing is really correct!

(待ちなよBaby!) 望まれた 
(それってBaby!) 解答を 
(ちょっと待ったBaby!) 覚えるのは 
(オレたちゃ何だ!?Baby!) 誰の為に 
 
例えばその紙に正解を書けたとして 
1年先 10年先 変わる? 
 
夢の片隅で描いた世界でいつか僕は大空を駆ける 
誰もこの心を咎めないよ 何が正しいなんて無い! 
 
やりたい事が僕にはあって 厳しい未来覚悟してる 
けれど大人は頭ごなし 一度失敗させてほしい 
 
(待ちなよBaby!) 自由だと 
(それってBaby!) 叫ぶなら 
(ちょっと待ったBaby!) 道のりは 
(オレたちゃ何だ!?Baby!) 荒く険しい 
 
代償の大きさに腹を括れたなら 
10秒先 1秒先 変わる 
 
夢よ叶え 何かを失おうとも 二兎を追う者は一兎をも得ず 
ただ一つだけの玉座を目指そう 最小限の荷物で 
 
僕のクエストは今はまだ 初めの町すら出ていない 
出よう出よういざ外へ 
 
例えばこの町で武器屋を営んだとして 
10年先 50年先 終われる? 
 
今は戯言だろう仕方がないよ いつの間にか見返す日が来る 
本当の敵はココにはいないよ 遥か… 
夢の片隅で描いた世界へ いつか僕はこの足で駆ける 
夢じゃない道は続いている いざ絶望の彼方へ 
いざ絶望の彼方へ
