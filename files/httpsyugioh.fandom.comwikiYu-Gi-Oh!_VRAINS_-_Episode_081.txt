" Heart of Darkness ", known as " Arrived at the Summit " in the Japanese version, is the eighty-first episode of  Yu-Gi-Oh! VRAINS  anime. It aired in Japan on December 12, 2018. It aired on Teletoon on June 14, 2020
 Playmaker  and his allies are investigating what  Lightning  has been up to, and they manage to find some traces of  Earth , who was captured by  SOL Technologies . When they head to where Earth's traces are, they find  the Gore  waiting for them! Burning with a twisted desire for victory, the Gore attacks Playmaker and Link Summons a  shocking monster ...
 
 Featured Duel: Playmaker vs. The Gore 
         
 The Duel is conducted as a  Speed Duel .
 Turn 1: The Gore 
 The Gore   sets  a monster.
 Turn 2: Playmaker 
 Playmaker  Sets a card. As he controls no monsters, Playmaker  Special Summons  " Linkslayer " (2000/600) from his hand in  Attack Position  via its own effect. Playmaker then  Normal Summons  " Storm Cipher " (2400/0). As a  Cyberse  monster was Normal Summoned to his field, Playmaker Special Summons " Boot Staggered " (2300/500) from his hand in Attack Position via its own effect.
 "Storm Cipher"  attacks  The Gore's set monster, which is revealed to be " Dinowrestler Valeonyx " (1600/0). The Gore activates the effect of " Dinowrestler Martial Anga " in his hand, sending it to the  GY  to prevent "Valeonyx" from being destroyed by battle with a monster that has equal or greater ATK, while also ending the  Battle Phase . During Playmaker's  End Phase , the effect of "Martial Anga" activates in the GY, Special Summoning itself to The Gore's field (1600/0) in Attack Position since Playmaker controls more monsters than him and the first effect of "Martial Anga" was used this turn.
 Turn 3: The Gore 
The Gore uses "Valeonyx" and "Martial Anga" to  Link Summon  " Dinowrestler Terra Parkourio " (1000/LINK-2/↑←) to the  Extra Monster Zone . The Gore activates " Crazy Evolution ", targeting a monster Playmaker controls and Special Summoning a " Dinowrestler " monster from his hand with the same  Level  as the targeted monster, then making all monsters he controls the same Type as the targeted monster until the End Phase. The Gore targets the Level 4 "Storm Cipher", Special Summons " Dinowrestler Systegosaur " (1900/0) and turns his monsters into the Cyberse type. As "Systegosaur" was Special Summoned, its effect lets The Gore add " World Dino Wrestling " from his Deck to his hand. The Gore uses "Terra Parkourio" and "Systegosaur" to Link Summon " G Golem Crystal Heart " (0/LINK-2/←↓) to the Extra Monster Zone. As it was sent to the GY to Link Summon, the effect of "Terra Parkourio" lets The Gore Special Summon a "Dinowrestler" from his GY with its effects negated. The Gore Special Summons "Martial Anga" in Defense Position. 
 The Gore activates the effect of "Crystal Heart", Special Summoning an  EARTH  Link Monster from his GY to his field so it is co-linked to "Crystal Heart", then placing a G Golem Counter on "Crystal Heart". He Special Summons "Terra Parkourio" to the zone the bottom-center Link Arrow of "Crystal Heart" points to ("Crystal Heart" G Golem Counters: 0 → 1). The effect of "Crystal Heart" increases the ATK of all EARTH monsters it points to by 600 for each G Golem Counter on it ("Terra Parkourio": 1000 → 1600 ATK). The Gore activates the  Field Spell  "World Dino Wrestling". Now while The Gore controls a "Dinowrestler" monster, The Gore and Playmaker can only attack with one monster each Battle Phase. If a "Dinowrestler" The Gore controls attacks Playmaker's monster, The Gore's monster gains 200 ATK during damage calculation only. As "World Dino Wrestling" was activated, the effect of "Terra Parkourio" lets The Gore add a "Dinowrestler" monster from his GY to his hand; he adds "Valeonyx". The Gore uses "Terra Parkourio" and "Martial Anga" to Link Summon " Dinowrestler King T Wrextle " (3000/LINK-3/↙↓↘) to the zone the bottom-center Link Arrow of "Crystal Heart" points to. 
 Duel continues in the next episode .
