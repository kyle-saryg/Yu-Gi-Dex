 Trivia 
 Kimeru has said that he read Yu-Gi-Oh so he could write the lyrics for this song. [ citation needed ] 
 Several characters shown are wearing the outfits they have in the manga version of the Memory World arc rather than the different clothes they wear in the anime and the appearance of "Ra" is based off of the manga. 
 The title of the song "Overlap", including in-song lyrics "eyes will overlap" may be a reference to  Yami Yugi / Atem  sharing the same body as  Yugi ; their eyes overlap one another into one when they switch control of the body. It could also be a reference instead to Yami Yugi entering and re-possessing the body of his past self (Atem) and seeing through his eyes into the past in  Millennium World . 
 Later in 2019, alongside the album release of  Go forward  in 'Liar', the second opening for  Yu-Gi-Oh! VRAINS , Kimeru did a self-reboot of this song within the album. 
 Lyrics (Full Version) 
 Romanji English 
 
 Kakusenai hodo mabayui hikari seijaku yaburi kono yo ni yomigaeru

Mabataki dekinai surudoi gankou o moyasu Hikari to kage no futatsu no kokoro kurisutaru ni utsuru mirai e 
Ima ugokidasu akaku minagiru eyes

Chiisa na akari tomoshita yoru no kimi to kawashita yakusoku   mamorinuku

Mabataki dekinai  surudoi gankou o moyasu 
Hikari to kage no futatsu no kokoro kurisutaru ni utsuru mirai e 
Ima ugokidasu akaku minagiru eyes 
Kasanariau EYES!
 
 
 
 Light, so bright that it can’t be hidden, shatters the silence and revives in this world 
The parched ground, quaking violently, contends with sparks, betting its life 
 
Just once more will be enough, make a miracle happen 
For the power to recover the pages of memories lost in the past 
 
The believing heart penetrates the darkness, searching for the place where its soul rests 
Its unblinking, sharp gaze gleams 
The 2 hearts of light and shadow head toward the future reflected in the crystal 
Now eyes brimming in red will fall into motion 
 
I announce the end to the days of licking each other’s wounds and quietly stand up 
I’ll always keep the promise I made with you on the night when we lit the tiny light 
 
A hazy mirage projects an image of you 
No matter what happens beyond where I go, I’m determined to never lose 
 
The heart believes in miracles, and the goddess of victory who came to greet it will defeat everything, undaunted by the strong and powerful 
The 2 hearts that continue to wander head toward an unfading world 
Now overlapping eyes will shine 
 
The moon melts into the setting sun 
For the power to recover the pages of memories lost in the past 
 
The faithful heart penetrates the darkness, searching for the place where its soul rests 
Its unblinking, sharp gaze gleams 
The 2 hearts of light and shadow head toward the future reflected in the crystal 
Now eyes brimming in red will fall into motion 
Eyes will overlap [1]
