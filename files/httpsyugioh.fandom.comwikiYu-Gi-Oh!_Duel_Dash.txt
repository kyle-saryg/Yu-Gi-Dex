 Yu-Gi-Oh! Duel Dash  is a video game developed by Little Guy Games for Konami on the Kinect for Xbox 360. [1]  Using motion controls, players race as  Kuriboh  and use cards to gain the upper hand. In some ways, it's similar to the earlier  Yu-Gi-Oh! 5D's Wheelie Breakers  game.
 The game is meant solely for promotional use and is not available for purchase. [2]  It was initially demonstrated at the North American  World Championship Qualifiers 2014 . [3]  It has since been used at followup Championships and at various conventions. [4]
