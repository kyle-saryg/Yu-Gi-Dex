 Summary 
 As  Chazz Princeton 's " Light and Darkness Dragon "  destroys   Syrus Truesdale 's " Solidroid α ", both  Jaden Yuki  and  David Rabb  realize that the it's the dragon spirit they had seen earlier.  Reggie MacKenzie  is perplexed, as they've already confirmed that the spirit they were after belonged to Jaden, yet another spirit is on the island, which wasn't anticipated. Elsewhere, the shadow realizes that the dragon spirit is the  Feather of Ma'at , a relic left behind by  the priests , which could pose a threat to him.
 Zane Truesdale  watches the  Duel  alongside  Alexis Rhodes , and he comments that though "Light and Darkness Dragon" can  negate   Spell ,  Trap  and  monster   effect , it can't negate the Summoning requirements of a monster. He believes that Syrus will destroy "Light and Darkness Dragon" on his next turn. Syrus declares that "Alpha" wasn't the only "Solidroid" he has, and he  removes  the " Turboroid ", " Strikeroid " and " Stealthroid " in his  Graveyard  from play to  Special Summon  " Solidroid β ". Its effect  activates , which would destroy one monster on the  field , but "Light and Darkness Dragon" automatically negates it by decreased its attack and defense by 500 points each. This weakens it enough that "Solidroid" can attack and destroy it, reducing Chazz to 1200  Life Points . In the stands, David states that Syrus was like a completely different person when he dueled him. Chazz is shocked that "Light and Darkness Dragon" was defeated so easily, but thinks that it will be still be with him in spirit. He  Summons  " Red Wyrm " in  Defense Position  and  Sets  a card.
 Syrus activates " Stop Defense ", switching "Red Wyrm" to Attack Position. "Solidroid" attacks and destroys it, but Syrus takes 500 damage via its effect, though Chazz himself is reduced to only 400. Chazz activates his  face-down  " Guidance of Light and Dark ", allowing him to remove the "Light and Darkness Dragon" in his Graveyard from play to Special Summon either a  LIGHT  or  DARK - attribute   Dragon - Type  monster from his hand. He Summons " Dark End Dragon ". Chazz activates its effect, reducing its attack and defense by 500 points each to destroy "Solidroid". He attacks  directly , but Syrus activates his face-down " Negate Attack ", negating the attack and ending the  Battle Phase . Frustrated, Chazz Sets a card to end his turn. Though he still has 2200 Life Points, Syrus couldn't afford to take any more damage, as he needs more than 2000 Life Points to activate his trump card - " Dimension Fusion (manga) ".
 Zane had never thought Syrus was face a card as powerful as "Dark End Dragon" and recalls a time from their childhood where Syrus dueled in a park with a friend named  Masao . Masao had just Summoned " Angel 07 ", but Syrus activates " Trap Hole " to destroy it. His friend is upset, as he's worked hard to Summon the card. Zane can see Syrus' hand and sees a  Level 4  monster (" Tankroid ") in it, so Syrus should be able to attack and win. However, feeling bad for Masao, who defeats him. This caused Zane to come to the conclusion that Syrus was too kind to be a duelist. Zane now believes that Syrus has changed, and is a true duelist.
 Syrus activates "Dimension Fusion",  paying  2000 Life Points to let both players Special Summon as many monsters that have been removed from play as they can. Syrus Summons "Stealthroid", Strikeroid" and "Turboroid". Though Chazz's "Light and Darkness Dragon" is also removed from play, he is unable to Summon it to its own effect. Syrus removes his three Roids from play to Special Summon " Solidroid γ " in Attack Position, whose effect activates, which would destroy all of Chazz's Set Spell and Trap Cards. Chazz  chains  his face-down " Duality ", Tributing his DARK attribute "Dark End Dragon" to Special Summon the LIGHT attribute " Light End Dragon " from his hand. Syrus attacks, but Chazz activates "Light End Dragon's" effect, reducing its attack points and defense points by 500 to reduce the attack and the defense points of the monster it is battling by 1500. "Solidroid" is destroyed, and Chazz has won. Zane approaches Syrus, and Syrus apologizes for losing, but still explains that he wants to fight as a  pro  duelist one day. Zane compliments Syrus on a fine duel.
