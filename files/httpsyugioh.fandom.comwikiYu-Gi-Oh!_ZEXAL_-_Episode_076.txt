 " Hard Knox ", known as " I'm Here, Thinking for the Best! My Name Is Rei Shingetsu " in the Japanese version, is the seventy-sixth episode of the  Yu-Gi-Oh! ZEXAL  anime. It first aired in Japan on October 21, 2012 and in the United States on August 31, 2013.
 A new student has transferred to  Yuma 's class. His name is  Ray Shadows  and has become huge fan of Yuma due to his winning the  WDC . Everyone at school is psyched at the arrival of the Pro Duelist  Devon Knox , who is going to a special lesson. Feeling bad for Yuma, who's banned from attending the special lesson (in the dub, he didn't sign up for the class), Ray runs off to get Devon's signature. But, what awaits Ray is a " Coaching " under the instruction of Devon, who is being controlled by the Barian faction!

 Featured Duels 
 Bronk Stone and four unnamed students vs. Devon Knox 
 The full  Duel  is not shown. The female student  activates  " Madolche Chateau " at one point, while  Devon  activates a  Trap Card . Eventually, Devon is shown to control " Armed Samurai - Ben Kei " in Attack Position with 7800 ATK ( 4/500 → 7800/800) as well as at least four Equip Cards equipped to it, allowing "Ben Kei" to attack five times (one normal attack and one additional attack for each Equip Card equipped to it). "Ben Kei" attacks all five students directly (Both Bronk and four unnamed students: ? → 0 LP).
 
 Ray Shadows vs. Devon Knox 
 Duel  is shown from an unspecified  turn .  Devon   controls  " Coach Captain Bearman " ( 8/2600/2700) in  Attack Position  and has an unspecified amount of  Life Points , while  Ray  controls no cards and has 1500  Life Points .
 Devon's turn 
"Coach Captain Bearman"  attacks   directly  (Ray: 1500 → 0 LP).
 
 Yuma Tsukumo vs. Devon Knox 
 Turn 1: Yuma 
 Yuma  draws. He then  activates  " Three Card Summon " to  reveal  three  Level  4 or lower  monsters  with the same Level in his  hand  and  Special Summon  one of them. Yuma reveals "Mimimic", " Rai Rider " and " Zubaba Knight " and subsequently Special Summons "Rai Rider" ( 3/1200/1400) in  Attack Position . Yuma  Normal Summons  "Zubaba Knight" ( 3/1600/900) in Attack Position. As he  controls  a Level 3 monster, Yuma Special Summons " Mimimic " ( 3/300/300) from his hand in Attack Position via its own  effect . Yuma  overlays  "Rai Rider", "Zubaba Knight", and "Mimimic" in order to  Xyz Summon  " Number 34: Terror-Byte " ( 3/0/2900, ORU: 3) in  Defense Position . Yuma  Sets  a card.
 Turn 2: Devon 
 Devon  draws. He activates " Training Grounds ", which will let him  send  two monsters from his hand to the  Graveyard  in order to Normal Summon one Level 7 or higher monster without  Tribute . Devon then activates the effect of "Training Grounds" to send " Panther Warrior " and " Coach Soldier Wolfbark " from his hand to the Graveyard and Normal Summon " Coach Captain Bearman " ( 8/2600/2700) in Attack Position. As Devon controls "Coach Captain Bearman", he activates " Bear's Boot Camp " to  Special Summon  "Coach Soldier Wolfbark" ( 4/1600/1200) in Attack Position (as "Coach Soldier Wolfbark" is a Level 4 Beast-Warrior type monster). He then activates the effect of "Coach Soldier Wolfbark" to revive another "Coach Soldier Wolfbark" ( 4/1600/1200) in Attack Position. Devon activates the effect of "Coach Captain Bearman" to double the Levels of all Level 4 or lower Beast-Warrior-Type monsters he controls until the  End Phase  (both "Coach Soldier Wolfbarks":   4 → 8). Devon overlays "Coach Captain Bearman" and two "Coach Soldier Wolfbarks" in order to Xyz Summon " Coach King Giantrainer " ( 8/2800/2000, ORU: 3) in Attack Position. 
 Devon  activates  the effect of "Coach King Giantrainer",  detaching  an  Overlay Unit  ("Coach King Giantrainer": 3 → 2 ORU) to  shuffle  both players' Decks. Both players will  draw a card  and reveal them. The player who draws the monster with the lower Level will take 800  damage , then the drawn cards are sent to the Graveyard. Devon draws the Level 8 " Beast King Barbaros " while Yuma draws the Level 1 " Stinging Swordsman " (Yuma: 4000 → 3200 LP). Devon activates the effect of "Coach King Giantrainer" again ("Coach King Giantrainer": 2 → 1 ORU) and Devon draws the Level 8 " Mosaic Manticore " while Yuma draws the Level 3 " Gagaga Girl " (Yuma: 3200 → 2400 LP). Devon activates the effect of "Coach King Giantrainer" again ("Coach King Giantrainer": 1 → 0 ORU) and Devon draws the Level 4 "Coach Soldier Wolfbark" while Yuma draws the Level 6 " Dododo Warrior " (Devon: 4000 → 3200 LP). 
 Devon activates " Rank-Up-Magic Barian's Force " to  Rank-Up  "Coach King Giantrainer" via  Chaos Xyz Evolution  in order to Xyz Summon " Chaos Xyz Coach Lord Ultimatrainer " ( 9/3800/2300, ORU: 1) in Attack Position. Devon then activates the third effect of "Rank-Up-Magic Barian's Force" to target "Terror-Byte", detach its Overlay Units ("Terror-Byte": 3 → 0 ORU), attach them to "Coach Lord Ultimatrainer" ("Coach Lord Ultimatrainer": 1 → 4 ORU), and decrease the ATK of "Terror-Byte" by 300 for each detached Overlay Unit.
 
         " Number 34: Terror-Byte " is  destroyed .     
 "Coach Lord Ultimatrainer"  attacks  and destroys "Terror-Byte" as the second effect of "Rank-Up-Magic Barian's Force" allows the Special Summoned monster to  negate  the effects of monsters that would prevent their  destruction   by battle . Devon activates the second effect of "Coach Lord Ultimatrainer" to detach all its Chaos Overlay Units ("Ultimatrainer": 4 → 0 ORU) and force Yuma to draw a card for every Chaos Overlay Unit detached and reveal it before sending the drawn card to the Graveyard. If a drawn card is a Level 4 or lower monster, Yuma will take damage equal to its ATK. Yuma draws the Level 3 " Achacha Archer " (Yuma: 2400 → 1200 LP), " Wonder Wand ", the Level 4 " Kagetokage " (Yuma: 1200 → 100 LP) and the Level 3 " Dotedotengu ", which has 0 ATK. 
 As "Dotedotengu" was sent to the Graveyard, Yuma activates its effect to return "Coach Lord Ultimatrainer" to the hand, but Devon activates the first effect of "Coach Lord Ultimatrainer", letting it become immune to monster effects once per turn. [Notes 1]  Yuma activates his  face-down  " Panic Burial " to decrease the ATK of "Coach Lord Ultimatrainer" by 100 for each monster sent to the Graveyard this turn and inflict the same amount to Devon as damage. Eighteen monsters were sent ("Ultimatrainer": 3800 → 2000 ATK; Devon 3200 → 1400 LP).
 Turn 3: Yuma 
Yuma draws "Gagaga x Gagaga". He then Normal Summons " Gagaga Magician " ( 4/1500/1000) in Attack Position. He then activates " Gagaga x Gagaga " to target "Gagaga Magician" (as it's a "Gagaga" monster) and Special Summon "Gagaga x Gagaga" as a monster with the same  Attribute , Type, Level, ATK and  DEF  as "Gagaga Magician" in Attack Position ( 4/1500/1000). Yuma overlays "Gagaga Magician" and "Gagaga x Gagaga" in order to Xyz Summon " Number 39: Utopia " ( 4/2500/2000, ORU: 2) in Attack Position. Yuma overlays "Utopia" with its two Overlay Units via Chaos Xyz Evolution in order to Xyz Summon " Chaos Number 39: Utopia Ray " ( 4/2500/2000, ORU: 3) in Attack Position. Yuma activates the effect of "Utopia Ray" three times, detaching all its Overlay Units ("Utopia Ray": 3 → 0 ORU) to increase its ATK by 500 for each one detached ("Utopia Ray": 2500 → 4000 ATK) and decrease the ATK of "Coach Lord Ultimatrainer" by 1000 for each one detached ("Ultimatrainer": 2000 → 0 ATK). "Utopia Ray" attacks and destroys "Coach Lord Ultimatrainer" (Devon: 1400 → 0 LP).

 Errors 
 It is unknown whether the  Attribute  of " CXyz Coach Lord Ultimatrainer " in this episode is  EARTH  or  LIGHT . Its  Overlay Unit  was yellow before it was converted into a Chaos Oveerlay Unit, which indicates LIGHT, but the  TV Tokyo  website lists it as EARTH ( CXyzCoachLordUltimatrainer-JP-ZX-NC.png ). 
 During  Yuma 's Duel, when " Chacoh Captain Bearman " is Summoned,  Ray 's  Duel Gazer  vanishes for one scene. 
 Trivia 
         Chazz's look-alike.     
 When  Yuma  and  Tori  are talking, a boy in the background on the right side resembles  Chazz Princeton . 
 Notes 
 
 ↑   The written Japanese anime lore of " Dotedotengu " states it can  return  a card on its  controller 's side of the  field  to the  hand , not the opponent's.
