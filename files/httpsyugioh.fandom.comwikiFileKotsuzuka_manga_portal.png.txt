 Biography 
 Duelist Kingdom 
         Bonz in the Duelist Kingdom tournament     
 In the  Duelist Kingdom  tournament, he along with  Sid  and  Zygor  were  Bandit Keith 's henchmen after he agreed to share his expertise with the young Duelists so that all four of them would advance to the finals. Keith wanted revenge against  Maximillion Pegasus  for humiliating him in the final match of the Intercontinental Championship. In secret, Keith merely wanted to use them for their Star Chips. Under Keith's tutelage, all three Duelists win Duels on the first day of the tournament, with Bonz at a total of four Star Chips. When Keith learned that  Yugi Muto ,  Joey Wheeler , and their friends had entered the tournament as well, he believed they would impede them, and sought to eliminate them. Bandit Keith later found a secret Graveyard field, and chose Bonz to play in it because it suited his Ghost Deck. Because Keith was initially unimpressed by Bonz's Deck, he lent Bonz some of his own cards to improve it, including his trump card, " Call of the Haunted ".
 Meanwhile, Sid and Zygor looked for Joey, believing him to be an amateur. When Joey ran away from the group towards a waterfall, Zygor beat him unconscious. Joey woke up in cave with a  Dueling Arena , complete with a  Graveyard field . Bonz challenged Joey to a  Duel  and tricked him into thinking that he must accept. Bonz had the upper hand, as his  Zombie - Type  monsters gained a 30%  ATK  bonus from the Graveyard Field, and when they were  destroyed , they just regenerated, and gained ATK from " Call of the Haunted ". However, when Yugi and their friends arrived, Joey managed to figure out the Zombies' main weakness; that their DEF is 0. Joey used " Shield and Sword " to switch their ATK and DEF values, and won the Duel. Bandit Keith then locked them  in, beat up his three companions, took their remaining Star Chips, and entered the  Duelist Kingdom Finals  himself, having abandoned the three, saying that they had outlived their usefulness to him.
 
 Battle City 
 Bonz, along with Sid and Zygor, were then seen right before the  Battle City  finals. The three stayed in a nearby cemetery and tricked people into giving up their  Locator Cards . However,  Yami Bakura  was not intimidated by their act and challenged them to a Duel in which the winner takes all the Locator Cards, and thus may enter the  Battle City Finals  directly. Bonz had the advantage at first, but Bakura won quickly after. He then banished them to Hell (the  Shadow Realm  in the English dub). It was never known in this series if they were ever released from their imprisonment. 
 
 Yu-Gi-Oh! 5D's 
 In  Yu-Gi-Oh! 5D's , a parody of him named  Ghost Takarazuka  is listed as one the Duelists defeated by  Hunter Pace . [2] 
 
 Other appearances 
 Bonz is seen in  Yu-Gi-Oh! Nightmare Troubadour  for the Nintendo DS. He has again a Deck made up of Zombies and support cards. He is ranked as 'Feeble'.

 Deck 
 Anime and manga 
 Bonz uses a  Zombie  Deck . During  Duelist Kingdom  his  Deck  was enhanced with cards given by  Bandit Keith , who coached Bonz for much of his Duel with Joey. The Deck relied on Keith's " Call of the Haunted " to revive the non-Zombie monsters placed in Bonz's Deck as Zombie-Types, making them immortal and boosting their ATK whenever they were destroyed. Bonz further enhanced them with " Pumpking the King of Ghosts ".
 In  Battle City , Bonz used " Great Mammoth of Goldfine " and a handful of new undead-themed cards such as " Nightmare's Steelcage " and " Skull Invitation ", but was outmatched against Yami Bakura's Occult Deck. When  Seeker  was looking up a Duelist's rarest cards on his laptop, " Call of the Haunted " was still listed as his rarest card.
