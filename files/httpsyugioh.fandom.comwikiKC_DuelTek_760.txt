 Biography 
 Zigfried von Schroeder  hacked into  KaibaCorp 's systems and raised the machine's difficulty level to its maximum, before connecting its  Life Points  to the location's doors, thus locking them until the computer could be defeated.  Yugi Muto  chose to Duel the computer using  Rick 's Deck. [1] 
 The computer relied on a  beatdown  strategy with  monsters  like " Berserk Gorilla " and " Airknight Parshath ", while depleting Yugi's  hand  with " Robbin' Goblin ". Yugi countered its strategy using " Heart of the Underdog " a card he had given to Rick and " Spirit Ryu " which gained  ATK  dependent on the number of  Dragons  discarded to the  Graveyard  in the  turn  it was  Summoned . In the end Yugi defeated the DuelTek and freed his friends. [2]
