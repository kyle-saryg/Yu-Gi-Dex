 When will the English version of Yu-Gi-Oh! Arc-V premeire?  Wikimaster Y  ( talk  •  contribs ) 23:20, March 23, 2014 (UTC)
 
 We don't know, and probably won't know until ZEXAL is much closer to being finished. It is however confirmed that they WILL finish ZEXAL, unlike GX and 5D's. NMBRHNTR64  ( talk  •  contribs ) 23:26, March 23, 2014 (UTC) 
 If you wanted to get technical, technically, 5D's did finish. True, they didn't get into the whole Arc Cradle-ZONE-big finale ending the original had; but honestly that, like GX4, is a bit too dark for the target audience of the US (which is suppose to be grade schoolers).  Rocket.knight.777  ( talk  •  contribs ) 02:34, March 24, 2014 (UTC) 
 And that's why the dubs are always so childish on top of not finishing some arcs (saw the original, never went back to the dubs ever again).  Shardsilver  ( talk  •  contribs ) 12:59, April 4, 2014 (UTC) 
 I see (that means I understand). Wikimaster Y  ( talk  •  contribs ) 01:19, March 24, 2014 (UTC)
 
 That's also the target audience in Japan. Cultural norms are simply different though.  Cheesedude  ( talk  •  contribs ) 17:23, March 24, 2014 (UTC) 
 How is it  confirmed  that Zexal II will finish airing in America? If I recall correctly, none of the shows have ever finished airing in America (heck, even the extended ending of Duel Monsters Episode 224 was cut). Can you please link a source, as that will definitely help. Thanks.  TheNeoTachyonDragon1007  ( talk  •  contribs ) 11:12, April 4, 2014 (UTC) 
 They announced on the official Facebook page that Zexal will be receiving a full Dub.  Photonkrios99  ( talk  •  contribs ) 11:32, April 4, 2014 (UTC) 
 It was actually claimed that 5D's ended due to "low ratings" or something like that. Neither the final season of 5D's or GX were really any darker then previous seasons (except for season 1, since that is never too serious). Plus, the final season of ZEXAL was just as dark if not more, yet it is already confirmed that they will finish it.  NMBRHNTR64  ( talk  •  contribs ) 15:24, April 4, 2014 (UTC) 
 I would interpret "low ratings" to mean "low viewership numbers", in which case the cancellations make much more sense.  「 ディノ 奴 千？！ 」 ?  ·  ☎ Dinoguy1000  17:26, April 4, 2014 (UTC) 
 If Yu-Gi-Oh! ZEXAL is going to be finished, then why is there already an English version of ARC V's logo? My guess? ARC V will debut in US once the Pendulum Summon cards arrive. Heck, we're up to the final ZEXAL pack in the TCG (Primal Origin in May). At this point, I'm done with ZEXAL since Japan is and is more interested in ARC V and Duelist Advent.  ReshiramArc1255  ( talk  •  contribs ) 04:28, April 8, 2014 (UTC)
 
 I'm sorry If Zexal is finished? They confirmed it themselves.  Photonkrios99  ( talk  •  contribs ) 04:48, April 8, 2014 (UTC)
 I hope you guys don't mind if I clear this up for you. Zexal II  will  finish, but after that, Arc-V will air in America. They made the Arc-V logo in advance because they are already getting ready for Arc-V (yep, that's the English Dub for you). I'm not sure if this was what Photonkrios99 was getting at but, there you have it.  TheNeoTachyonDragon1007  ( talk  •  contribs ) 00:02, April 10, 2014 (UTC) 
 Why didn't Yu-Gi-Oh! Arc-V show the English air date? My guess is the English dub will never be on air.  Wikimaster Y  ( talk  •  contribs ) 04:33, March 25, 2015 (UTC) 
 We know when the first episode is reveled and the the date. Yugioh Arc V is poor rally air on Hulu anyway liek the rest of Yugioh Zexal 2Its Hero Time! 04:39, March 25, 2015 (UTC)
 
 Yu-Gi-Oh! ZEXAL  2 is already finished.  Wikimaster Y  ( talk  •  contribs ) 23:19, March 26, 2015 (UTC) 
 So there is a chance for  Yu-Gi-Oh! ARC-V  to air in the English version. I saw the English ending on YouTube.  Wikimaster Y  ( talk  •  contribs ) 23:21, March 26, 2015 (UTC) 
 If you mean this, it's fake:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1i_2vWsS1k 
It's the dub opening music mixed with the Japanese ending.  MasterMarik  ( talk  •  contribs ) 23:39, March 26, 2015 (UTC)
 You see  User:MasterMarik , I thought there wasn't going to be an English version of  Yu-Gi-Oh! ARC-V .  Wikimaster Y  ( talk  •  contribs ) 22:40, April 22, 2015 (UTC)
 Seriously, when is  Yu-Gi-Oh! ARC-V  going to premiere in its English version?  Wikimaster Y  ( talk  •  contribs ) 23:29, May 3, 2015 (UTC)
 I'm surprised that, even after the "preview" (aka: first dubbed episode), we still don't have any idea or info on when and where the Arc-V dub will air "officially". While I can guess that Yugioh.com and perhaps Hulu will have the episodes when they air, it's the  when  part that I'm curious about. Does anyone have any possible insight on the subject? Just curious to know.  Zero Blade Tiger  ( talk  •  contribs ) 20:20, May 31, 2015 (UTC)
 
 serie name 
 i have read in the tv tropes fridge page of yugioh arc v the fallow words: 
 
 "Arc-V" may seem like an unimaginative title. However, remember what is a main motive of this season (Pendulum)? Now what does a Pendulum swing in? 
 a bit ridiculous an non-indicative name, right. Wrong, V is also the roman numeral to 5, just do the math and you gone discovers the arc-v meaning. 
 Dragonempeorslayer  ( talk  •  contribs ) 19:24, May 24, 2014 (UTC)
 I changed the date it said 52 episode as of april 20 while it's actully 52 as of april 19 cause Yu-Gi-Oh Arc V aires Every Sunday and is Fantranslated 2 days after  Herald-Fayez  ( talk  •  contribs ) 18:55, April 25, 2015 (UTC)
 Well it took us 1 season to know what GX means, same with 5D's and Zexal. the title will be explained later on.

 Allusions? 
 Why were the allusions to previous series deleted in this page?

 Because they were stupid and speculative, to quote UltimateKuriboh:
 "If someone feels that strongly about the "allusions" being recorded, feel free to move them to a sub-user page or a forum page. Anyone can interpret all sorts of "allusions", but we have no idea if they're deliberate. Best not to tempt speculation" 
 : Dread  ( talk  •  contribs ) 04:08, September 29, 2015 (UTC) 
 
 If that were a legitimate reason, then you might as well delete all the allusions and speculation from the card trivia pages.  Kore wa shomeidesu.  ( talk  •  contribs ) 06:06, September 29, 2015 (UTC) 
 You wanna argue with the Admins on that be my guest. 
 On a completely unrelated note, we do not allow for Speculation on teh Trivia pages....or anywhere really

 ending 
 i just now read in a reliable source that arc v is confirmed to end in spring 2017 so should i write it or no. each yugioh series since 5ds runs for 3 years. 5ds started in april 2008 and ended on march 2011,zexal started on april 2011 and ended on march 2014 so arc v started on april 2014 and will most likely end in march 2017 Saeryukgkj  ( talk  •  contribs ) 18:23, June 10, 2016 (UTC)
 
 Ending date 
 Are we really sure, Arc-V end in spring 2017 ? CrimsonFlare  ( talk  •  contribs ) 18:10, June 12, 2016 (UTC)
 They have already confirmed in reliabe source haven't you read it,  Saeryukgkj  ( talk  •  contribs ) 19:44, June 12, 2016 (UTC)
 Yeah, a source that you haven't linked to as far as I know.  Sanokal K-T  ( talk  •  contribs ) 19:52, June 12, 2016 (UTC)
 
I did some research and i have not seen any webiste who said Arv-V end in spring 2017. CrimsonFlare  ( talk  •  contribs ) 20:37, June 12, 2016 (UTC)
 
 Did anyone else notice? 
 This Yu-Gi-Oh series is VERY similar to Kamen Rider Decade. The previous shows have been turned into separate dimensions, and there's a conflict going on that requires the Protagonist to go to all of them to bring peace, and the protagonist is apparently "the Devil". There are tons of other similarities too. Do you think the creators purposely made it like Decade? Manyfaceblake  ( talk  •  contribs ) 05:06, February 20, 2017 (UTC)
