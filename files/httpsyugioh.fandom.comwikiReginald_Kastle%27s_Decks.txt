 Shark utilizes a  Burn  strategy in order to gain an early advantage through cards such as " Submersible Carrier Aero Shark " and " Booming Urchin ", with a focus on  Rank 3   Xyz Monsters . After losing to Yuma he modified his Deck to counter the " Numbers " by negating their effects with his  ace monster  " Black Ray Lancer " [3] , as well as cards to take  control  of them. Reginald's Deck also sports a few cards that  destroy   Spell  and  Trap Cards  such as " Skull Kraken " and " Mystical Space Typhoon ".

 Shark's  Deck  has become even more flexible in terms of his use of  Xyz Summoning , now ranging from  Rank 3  to  Rank 5 . In addition, he also uses a large quantity of cards to  swarm   monsters  to Xyz Summon such as " Tri-Slice ", " Panther Shark " and " Eagle Shark ". His Deck also features a range of new " Shark " monsters as well as other aquatic fauna like " Big Whale " and " Starfish ". Shark also uses a number of cards to reduce the amount of  Xyz Material  required for his monsters such as " Double Fin Shark ", " Xyz Crown " and " Ghost Salvage ".

 Upon regaining his identity and powers as a  Barian Emperor , Nash continues to use the same Deck he used as a human, with the addition of his new " Over-Hundred Number ", " Number 101: Silent Honor ARK ", along with its  upgraded form . He also supplements his Deck with " Rank-Up-Magic " cards such as " Rank-Up-Magic - The Seventh One ", which lets him  Rank-Up  his "Over-Hundred Number" from the  Graveyard ,  field  or  Extra Deck  and " Rank-Up-Magic Quick Chaos ", a  Quick-Play Spell Card  which allowed him to instantly Rank-Up his " Number 73: Abyss Splash " into " Number C73: Abyss Supra Splash ". Nash is also able to perform a " Chaos Draw " which allows him to create and draw cards that allow him to counter his opponent's strategy. 
 After  Don Thousand 's defeat, Nash acquired the other six "Over-Hundred Numbers" and their "Chaos" versions. He used another variant of this Deck, which focused on swarming the field with those "Numbers", using several support cards such as " Chaos Hundred Universe ", " The Greatest Duo of the Seven Emperors " and " Hundred Summon " to Summon them. The final goal of this is to Summon " CXyz Barian Hope ", a monster that can use the effects of all the " Chaos Over-Hundred Numbers ".
