Yu-Gi-Oh! Millennium World  is part of the English  Yu-Gi-Oh!  manga . It occurs after  Yu-Gi-Oh! Duelist . In this arc, the plot has shifted to the pharaoh returning to Egypt and  Duel Monsters  is played less frequently. While the Japanese manga continued numbering as normal keeping the name  Yu-Gi-Oh! ,  Yu-Gi-Oh! Millennium World  started numbering Volumes and Chapters from 1.
 The first chapter,  Duel 1  is Battle 279 in the Japanese manga.
 With  Yu-Gi-Oh! Millennium World  came the reappearance of  Yu-Gi-Oh!  in  Shonen Jump  in the United States, which had been discontinued since the end of the original seventh volume.
 
 Plot 
 The plot contains the original version of the  King's Memories  and  Ceremonial Battle  arcs, including the  Shadow RPG , which was greatly cut and simplified in the anime version.
