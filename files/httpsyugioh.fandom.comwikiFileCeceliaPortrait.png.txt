 Biography 
 Cecelia was Pegasus' childhood sweetheart. They first met at a party thrown by his businessman father in Las Vegas fourteen years before  Duelist Kingdom . Cecelia and Pegasus were married and Pegasus, an artist at the time, constantly drew pictures of his love. 
 However, Cecelia died of a disease shortly after their wedding at the age of 17, this prompted Pegasus to search for a way to bring her back, ultimately culminating in his acquiring of the  Millennium Eye  from  Shadi . Pegasus' feelings towards his beloved were eventually revealed to  Yugi Muto  and his friends after they found  Pegasus' diary , which displayed his emotions. His reason for the cruel methods he put Yugi and his friends through to acquire Kaiba Corp was to use it to create a hologram of Cecelia. In the English dub, the reason was to combine the power of the Millennium Items with Kaiba Corp's holographic technology to bring Cecelia back to life.
