 Biography 
 Daimon was one of  Kaiba 's  Game Masters . He required a life-support capsule to stay alive, but was able to leave the capsule for short periods. He and Kaiba were good friends when Kaiba was a child, with Seto bringing him snacks like oranges when Daimon first got sick.
 Kaiba released Daimon from the capsule so he could be the fourth opponent to challenge  Yugi Mutou . By staging an accident, Kaiba was able to lure Yugi to Duel Daimon. If Yugi refused,  Anzu  was to be be devoured by a mechanical dragon. During this Duel, Daimon stated that the reason he Duels for Kaiba is that he believes Kaiba's good side will come out again. Kaiba provides Daimon with a device that allowed him to see Yugi's hand, but Daimon refused to use it. After being defeated, Daimon took Yugi aside and asked him to restore Kaiba's lost innocence.
 
 Deck 
 Daimon plays a  Zombiemaster Deck , focusing on getting his weak monsters destroyed to power up his " Zombiemaster " card, a strategy that would be reflected in the Duel Monsters anime by Rebecca Hawkins with her "Shadow Ghoul" deck. Ironically both strategies successfully defeated Yugi Muto.
