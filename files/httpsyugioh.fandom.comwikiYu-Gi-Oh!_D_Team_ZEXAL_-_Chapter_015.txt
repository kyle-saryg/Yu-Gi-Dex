 An All-Out Duel!! 
 
 "A Chivalrous Duel!!"  is the fifteenth chapter of the  Yu-Gi-Oh! D Team ZEXAL  manga. It was first published July 3, 2013 in the  Saikyō Jump  magazine.
 Yuma   duels  against  Kento Naito 's " Noble Knights ", as Kento believes that Yuma and his friends are affiliated with  Raizo Akuma , who stole Kento's club's room.
 
 Featured Duel: Yuma Tsukumo vs. Kento Naito 
 Turn 1: Yuma 
 Yuma   draws  " Gogogo Gigas ", while his  hand  contains " Ganbara Knight ", " Ganbara Lancer ", " Tasuke Knight ", " ZW - Tornado Bringer " and " Xyz Revenge ". Yuma  Sets  "Gogogo Gigas" (0/2200).
 Turn 2: Kento 
 Kento  draws " Noble Knight Artorigus ", while his hand contains " Noble Knight Gawayn ", " Noble Arms - Arfeudutyr ", " Noble Arms - Gallatin ", " Noble Arms of Destiny " and " Forbidden Chalice ". Kento  Normal Summons  " Noble Knight Gawayn " (1900/500) and  equips  it with "Arfeudutyr". He uses the  effect  of "Afeudutyr", permanently reducing the  ATK  of "Gawayn" by 500 (1900 → 1400) to  destroy  a Set card. He destroys "Gogogo Gigas". He then equips "Gawayn" with "Noble Arms of Destiny" and "Noble Arms - Gallatin"; the latter increases the ATK of "Gawayn" by 1000 (1400 →  2400). "Gawayn"  attacks  Yuma  directly  (Yuma 4000 → 1600). 
 Turn 3: Yuma 
Yuma draws " Xyz Reception ". He Normal Summons " Tasuke Knight " (1700/1000) and activates "Xyz Reception", letting him  Special Summon  a monster from his hand with the same  Level  as one he  controls . He Special Summons " Ganbara Knight " (0/1800). Yuma  overlays  his two Level 4 monsters to  Xyz Summon  " Number 39: Utopia " (2500/2000) in  Attack Position . He equips "Utopia" with the "ZW - Tornado Bringer" in his hand via that card's effect, increasing its ATK by 1300 (2500 → 3800). "Utopia" attacks "Gawayn" (Kento 4000 →  2600), but the effect of the equipped "Noble Arms of Destiny" prevents the destruction of "Gawayn"  by battle .
 Turn 4: Kento 
Kento Normal Summons "Noble Knight Artorigus" (1800/1800). He overlays his two Level 4 " Noble Knight " monsters to Xyz Summon " Artorigus, King of the Noble Knights " (2000/2000) in Attack Position. Its effect allows Kento to equip "Artorigus" with up to three " Noble Arms "  Equip Spell Cards  from his  Graveyard . He equips it with "Arfeudutyr", "Gallatin" (2000 →  3000) and "Destiny". Kento  activates the effect of "Artorigus",  detaching  an  Overlay Unit  to destroy  Spell / Trap Cards  on the  field  up to the number of "Noble Arms" cards he controls. He destroys "Tornado Bringer" ("Utopia" 3800 →  2500). He then equips "Artorigus" with " Noble Arms - Caliburn ", increasing its ATK by 500 (3000 →  3500) and his own  Life Points  by 500 (Kento 2600 →  3100). Finally, he activates "Forbidden Chalice", increasing the ATK of "Utopia" by 400 (2500 →  2900) but negating its effects. "Artorigus" attacks and destroys "Utopia" (Yuma 1600 → 1000).
 Turn 5: Yuma 
Yuma draws " Rank-Up-Magic Limited Barian's Force ". As Kento controls an  Xyz Monster  that has at least one Overlay Unit, Yuma activates "Xyz Revenge", letting him Special Summon an Xyz Monster from his Graveyard and  attach  an Overlay Unit from his opponent's monster to it. He Special Summons "Utopia" (2500/2000) and attaches the Overlay Unit from "Artorigus". As his Life Points are 1000 or less, Yuma performs a  Chaos Xyz Evolution , overlaying "Utopia" with its Overlay Unit to Special Summon " Number C39: Utopia Ray " (2500/2000) in Attack Position. Yuma activates the effect of "Utopia Ray" twice, detaching two Overlay Units to increase its ATK by 500 for each, while decreasing that of "Artorigus" by 1000 for each ("Utopia Ray" 2500 →  3500, "Artorigus" 3500 →  1500). "Utopia Ray" attacks "Artorigus" (Kento 3100 →  1100), with the effect of the equipped "Noble of Arms of Destiny" preventing the destruction of "Artorigus" by battle. Yuma activates "Limited Barian's Force",  Ranking-Up  "Utopia Ray" and performing a Chaos Xyz Evolution to Special Summon " Number C39: Utopia Ray V " (2600/2000) in Attack Position. Yuma activates the effect of "Utopia Ray V", detaching an Overlay Unit to destroy a monster his opponent controls and inflict damage to his opponent equal to its ATK. He destroys "Artorigus" (Kento 1000 →  0).
