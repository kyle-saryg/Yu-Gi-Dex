 Champion Pack: Game One  is Tournament  Booster Pack  set in the  TCG  that contains 20 highly-competitive cards from winning tournament decks and a brand new  Ultra Rare  card. Made exclusively for hobby and tournament stores across the U.S. and Europe, the new Championship Packs were supposed to be available on October 11, 2006, but they were delayed, being released in late November. The packs includes  Super Rare  foil cards as " Night Assailant ", " Book of Moon ", and " Metamorphosis ", and introduces the new  Ultra Rare   Monster Card  from  Yu-Gi-Oh! GX , " Satellite Cannon ", which was only available in the  OCG .
 Even though this Pack apparently was not released in Spanish, it is listed on the Spanish version of the official card database. Curiously, it uses the French name. [1]
