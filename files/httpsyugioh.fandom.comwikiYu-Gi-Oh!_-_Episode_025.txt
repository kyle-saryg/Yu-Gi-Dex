 Summary 
 The group is outside  Pegasus 's castle, but  Yugi  still won't respond to anyone. He is unable to get over what happened between him and  Seto Kaiba .  Mai Valentine  shows up and offers him some of her  Star Chips , but Yugi won't move. She challenges him to a  Duel  for the chips, but  Téa  decides to take his place. The duel does not start off very well for Téa, as Mai's " Harpie Lady " pounces on her monster and she still does not know some of the rules of the game. She uses a combination of " De-Spell ", " Silver Bow and Arrow ", and " Elf's Light " on " Shining Friendship " to destroy Mai's "Harpie Lady". Mai is about to activate " Harpie's Feather Duster ", but decides not to. She then purposely forfeits the Duel. Yugi snaps out of it, accepts Mai's Star Chips, and everyone heads towards the castle.

Téa's  hand  contains a second copy of " Petit Angel "," Silver Bow and Arrow ", " Shining Friendship ", " Waboku ", and " Magician of Faith ". Téa then Sets a card. "Fairy's Gift" attacks "Harpie Lady", but Mai  activates  her face-down " Rose Whip " and  equips  it to "Harpie Lady", increasing the latter's  ATK  and  DEF  by 300 ("Harpie Lady": 1300 → 1600/1400 → 1700). "Harpie Lady" destroys "Fairy's Gift" (Téa: 1300 → 1100 LP).

 Turn 8: Mai 
Mai activates "Cyber Shield" and equips it to "Harpie Lady", increasing the latter's ATK and DEF by 500 ("Harpie Lady": 1600 → 2100/1400 → 1900). She then activates " De-Spell " to destroy "Silver Bow and Arrow" ("Shining Friendship": 1600 → 1300/1400 → 1100). "Harpie Lady" attacks and destroys Téa's Set "Magician of Faith" (300/400).

 Differences in adaptations 
 Mai's cleavage was removed. 
 Although it is hard to see, " Fairy's Gift " is naked in the Japanese version. Her naked body is obscured in the dub. 
 " Harpie Lady 's" costume gets covered up in the dub. 
 The spikes on " Cyber Shield 's" breastplate are removed. 
 After " Shining Friendship " becomes an angel human-like being due to " Elf's Light ", it is shown naked. In the dub, it is shown wearing a dress. 
 " Shining Friendship " in the dub has no halo above its head on the card. 
 In the original Japanese version, Téa reads the text on "Waboku". 
 
 
 Mistakes 
 In the dub, despite " Shining Friendship " having no halo when it appeared as a card, it still has a halo on top of its head when it is summoned. 
 Téa had four cards in her hand when she summoned " Fairy's Gift "; however, when she looks at her hand, she has six cards in her hand. 
 When Téa gives Yugi the star chips, there are six star chips instead of five. (In the Japanese, Bakura stated that Mai collected 16 star chips, thus having 6 star chips handed over to Téa and then from Téa to Yugi) 
 When " Harpie Lady " attacks " Petit Angel ", Petit Angel's halo is missing. 
 Mai gives the group a total of 6 star chips, but she owed Yugi 8.
