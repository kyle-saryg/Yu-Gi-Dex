 Design 
 "Thorn Prisoner" monsters appear to be humanoid fiends shackled to various torturing or execution devices by brambles, referring to how their effects 'torture' their user. However, " Thorn Overserver Vandarlizuma ", being a  Fusion  of the other monsters, refers to the agony of the monsters being linked to one another.

 Playing style 
 "Thorn Prisoner" monsters all have 0  ATK / DEF  and revolve around depleting the player's own  LP  while using  stall  tactics. While monsters such as " Thorn Prisoner Darli " and " Thorn Observer Zuma " hold off the opponent's  attacks , the player punishes the opponent with  Thorn Counters  using the effect of cards like " Thorn Growth ". Once the player's LP are low enough, they can Summon " Thorn Overserver Vandarlizuma " with incredibly high ATK, allowing the player to easily  OTK  the opponent.
