 Duos  (デュオス  Dyuosu ) is a spirit  ka  in the  Yu-Gi-Oh!  manga .
 Its appearance, Graveyard-centric effect and relationship to Seto make it loosely reminiscent of the card " Swordstalker ", which was used by  Seto Kaiba .
 
 Biography 
       Duos , increasing its power, by sacrificing  Dark Ushebti     
 When the  High Priests  partook in  mock battles  to strengthen their  ka  and improve tactics, Seto summoned Duos. Initially its teammates and their opponents used various abilities to counter each other's moves. Once its teammates,  Dark Ushebti  and  Zerua  had outlived their usefulness, Seto got Duos to destroy them, since its power increased through sacrifice. With its strength tripled, Duos took out its enemies  Magus of Illusion ,  Spiria  and  Desert Trapdoor Spider  in one blow. [1] 
 Duos was summoned again for  Atem 's  demonstration  of the pitfalls of Seto's reckless strength-driven battle strategy. Seto was insulted by Atem's choice of a weak  ka ,  Kuriboh , and got Duos to try and destroy its slab, before the  ka  could materialize. However a Kuriboh emerged from each fragment of the shattered slab and covered Duos' arm, making it unable to use its sword. [1]
