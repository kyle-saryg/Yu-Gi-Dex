A  common Summoning condition  is a  Summoning condition  that applies to all forms of  Summoning , including  Normal Summon ,  Flip Summon , and  Special Summon .
 A monster with this restriction can still be freely  Set  (and then potentially flipped by an effect or attack), but cannot be Summoned unless the condition is met. Many " Guardian " monsters have this condition, which prevents them from being Summoned unless you also control their respective  Equip Card .
