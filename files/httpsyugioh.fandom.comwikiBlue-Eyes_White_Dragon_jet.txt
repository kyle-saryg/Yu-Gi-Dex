 Functionality 
 As the vehicle's name suggests, the aircraft takes the shape and appearance of the Blue-Eyes White Dragon. The cockpit is located within the 'forehead' of the dragon with a wide transparent windshield. The aircraft has the ability to carry two crew members, one pilot and one co-pilot or passenger. The jet utilises four after-burning turbo-jet engines with capability for speed increase or decrease, as indicated by yellow and red flames. The jet's four engines have the ability to be angled towards the ground at a 90 degree angle and is able to accomplish Vertical-Take-Off-(and)-Landings (VTOL) similar to a helicopter. Its landing gears consists of four claws in the shape of that of the Blue-Eyes White Dragon's. In  Yu-Gi-Oh! The Movie: Pyramid of Light  , the aircraft is shown to be able to be launched via steam-catapult similar to Naval aircraft aboard aircraft carriers, and takes off from large mobile skids once take-off velocity is reached. The aircraft can also undergo mid air refueling extending its range to intercontinental travel. [ citation needed ]

 The jet was also shown in  Yu-Gi-Oh! The Movie: Pyramid of Light  when Kaiba had to go meet  Maximillion Pegasus  on his own private island in seeking a way to finally defeat  Yugi Muto /Yami Yugi. 
 It also appeared in  The Dark Side of Dimensions . In the movie, Kaiba used it to travel to the  Shrine of the Millennium Stone  to recover the  Millennium Puzzle  pieces. After Mokuba left with the pieces of the puzzle, Kaiba left  Kul Elna  onboard the jet.
