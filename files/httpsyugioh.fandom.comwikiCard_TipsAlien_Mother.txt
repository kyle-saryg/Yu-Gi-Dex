 This card can be searched by " Dogu ", " Single Purchase ", " Temple of the Kings ", " Painful Escape ", " Transmodify ", " Witch of the Black Forest ", " Rescue Ferret ", " Chaos Zone ", " Damage = Reptile ", " King of the Feral Imps ", " Flying Saucer Muusik'i ", " Crop Circles " and " "A" Cell Recombination Device ". 
 Use the lingering effect of " Planet Pollutant Virus " to guarantee that any monster your opponent summons gets an  A-Counter . Then, when this card is attacked, use cards like " Shrink " or " Rising Energy " to reverse the matchup. That way, you take control of the destroyed monster at the end of your opponent's Battle Phase. 
 If this card can attack more than once (through cards such as " Twin Swords of Flashing Light - Tryce " or  "Infernoble Arms - Hauteclere" ) and destroys two monsters with an A-Counter(s), both will be summoned to your field at the end of your Battle Phase.
