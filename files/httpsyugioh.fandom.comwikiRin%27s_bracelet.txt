 Appearance 
       The bracelet at a different angle     
 It is a thick, metallic bracelet that fits the circumference of Rin's wrist. However, as a child, Rin's wrist was smaller in comparison to the bracelet. It has a small green gem set in the center of an ornate spiral design that rests over a series of three stacked rings.
 The swirling metallic bands create a wind-themed design that is additionally reminiscent of the rings created in a  Synchro Summon . Said design might also be inspired by "the traditional themes of natural beauty in Japanese aesthetics" ( 花 鳥 風 月 ), referencing the " 風 " (wind) for Rin as well as her  wind -based  Wind Witch  deck.
 
 Abilities 
 Unlike  Zuzu's bracelet , Rin's does not react when at least two of  Yuya 's  counterparts  are present, implying it has a different ability, which is still unknown. [1]  One ability known is its role as a keystone that prevent the  Synchro Dimension  from fusing back into the  Original Dimension , as shown when the dimension begins to slowly fusing with the others when Rin and the bracelet are absorbed into  ARC-V .
 
 Biography 
 History 
       Rin's bracelet orginal form.     
 The bracelet was originally a  card  created by  Leo Akaba  using natural energy from the wind. It was used with the  other   three   cards  to confront  Z-ARC , however,  Ray  took them from her father in order to oppose Z-ARC herself. During the Duel, the card took its shape as the bracelet and appeared on Ray's right arm. Along with the others, the bracelet helped her stop  Supreme King Z-ARC , and split him, along with herself and the  Original Dimension . Later, Rin gained ownership of the bracelet. [2] 
 Rin is seen wearing this bracelet in her childhood as well as when she was being pursued by  Yuri . [1] 
 
 Duel Academy 
         Riley with the Natural Energy Bracelets.     
 When Rin was transferred into  ARC-V [3] , her bracelet returned to its  card form . It was then taken with the  other   three   cards  by  Leo  to use against  Z-ARC  again, but they were  destroyed  by Z-ARC, who defeated Leo. [4]  However, using  Riley 's body,  Ray  retrieved the  Natural Energy Cards  from the  Graveyard  and activated them to slowly strip away " Supreme King Z-ARC 's" protection effects and causing the  Natural Energy Bracelets  to materialize on Riley's arm. With  Yuya 's  help , Ray defeated Z-ARC again with the effects of the Natural Energy Cards and Riley sealed away Z-ARC's spirit within her own body to prevent his soul from being split again. [5] 
 Following the battle against Z-ARC and the  Standard Dimension 's rebirth into the  "Pendulum Dimension" , the bracelet disappeared following Riley's regression into an infant. [6]
