 A  Normal Spell Card , formerly known as a  Normal Magic Card  (Japanese:  通 常 魔 法 カード  Tsūjō Mahō Kādo ), is a  Spell Speed 1   Spell Card , so it cannot  chain  to other  effects , even those of other Normal Spell Cards, but can be chained to by  Spell Speed 2  or  Spell Speed 3  cards. 
 The turn player may  Set  a Normal Spell Card and activate it on the same turn, which is useful if the player plans to use effects of cards that discard from your hand (such as " Card Destruction " and " Morphing Jar ") to keep their useful Spell Cards from being discarded. Normal Spell Cards can only be activated during the turn player's  Main Phase 1  and  Main Phase 2 , with the exception of " Curse of Fiend " which can only be activated during the  Standby Phase .
 After the Chain in which the Normal Spell Card was activated resolves, it is sent to the  Graveyard , unless any the Normal Spell Card specifies that it  remains on the field  (such as " Swords of Revealing Light ").
 Normal Spell Cards have no icon in the  OCG / TCG , but some video games use a blank circle  .
