 Union monsters  (ユニオンモンスター  Yunion Monsutā ) are  Effect Monsters  with the "Union"  ability . Each Union monster has an effect that allows it to  equip  itself to a monster as an  Equip Spell Card  or  unequip  itself to  Special Summon  itself to a  Monster Zone .
 Union monsters were introduced in  Advent of Union .
 Not all monsters that  can treat themselves as Equip Cards  are Union monsters; for example, " Worm Millidith ", " Dark Necrofear ", " Kiseitai ", " Armory Arm ", and " Number 58: Burner Visor " all have effects that turn these cards into  Equip Cards , but none of them are Union monsters.
 The equip-themed " Vylon " and " Machina " archetypes as well as the  A-to-Z  series contain several Union monsters.

 Effects 
 Every Union monster has an  Ignition Effect  that allows it to either  equip  to or  unequip  from the host once per  turn  while it is on the field. If a Union monster unequips itself with its own effect, it is Special Summoned; Union monsters last printed prior to  Structure Deck: Seto Kaiba  can only be Special Summoned in  Attack Position  if Summoned this way. Additional cards, such as " Formation Union " and " Combination Attack ", can equip and unequip Union monsters, with "Formation Union" even treating the Union monster as having been equipped by its own effect. They also do not require you to Special Summon them in Attack Position after being unequipped from a monster.
 Older Union monsters have an effect to  destroy  themselves if the monster they are equipped to would be  destroyed by battle . More recent Union monsters destroy themselves if the monster they are equipped to would be destroyed by any means. All Union monsters printed since  Structure Deck: Seto Kaiba  (including reprints) destroy themselves if the monster they are equipped to would be destroyed by battle or card effect.
 Prior to  Structure Deck: Seto Kaiba , all Union monsters had a  condition  that meant that only one Union monster could be equipped to a monster at a time. In the  OCG , from  Structure Deck: Seto Kaiba  onward, Union monsters no longer have this restriction (including reprints).
 
 Text 
 The most recent Union card text in the  TCG  reads as follows:
 
 Once per turn, you can either: Target 1 [X] monster you control; equip this card to that target, OR: Unequip this card and Special Summon it. A monster equipped with this card [...], also if the equipped monster would be destroyed by battle or card effect, destroy this card instead.
 
 Trivia 
 Newer Union monsters tend to combine with Machine-Type monsters and are Machine-Type themselves. 
 Currently, there are no Union Monsters with more than 2000 DEF.
