 The  D1 Grand Prix , or  D1GP  for short, [1]  is a tournament in the  Yu-Gi-Oh! 5D's  manga , organized and sponsored by  Rex Goodwin . [2] [3] 
 Rex Goodwin initially says the Grand Prix aims to gather the best  Turbo Duelists  in the world, irrespective of race, religion or criminal record in order to decide the Emperor of Turbo Duels, who will then face Jack, the "King", in a Turbo Duel. [4]  Later, he explains to  Yusei  that his true objective is to gather Duelists strong enough to possess a  Duel Dragon  card and save the world from  Skeleton Knight . [5]  However, his true objective was to find  Duel Priests  and  Priestesses  to conduce the  Festival of Duality  with the Skeleton Knight and revive the  Ultimate God . [6] 
 
       The Best 4 of the second D1GP.     A second D1GP was organized one year after the first D1GP was interrupted by Goodwin and the Skeleton Knight's plans. In the section edition,  Yusei Fudo ,  Kalin Kessler ,  Akiza Izinski  and  Crow Hogan  advanced to the semi-finals of the tournament, with Yusei Fudo ultimately winning and earning the right of facing Jack. [7]  Upon defeating Jack, Yusei earned the title of Emperor of Turbo Duels. [8]

 Format 
 All entrants in the tournament are required to have a " Checkered Flag of Glory " card. [4] 
 The first stage of the tournament is a two game-elimination secret tournament format. Players are not told who they will be facing until just before the  Turbo Duel . This way players are unable to adjust their Decks to gain an advantage over their opponent. [3] 
 
       The twelve  Duel Zodiacs  throughout  Saiko Island .     The second stage takes place in  Saiko Island , in  Satellite  Zone Zero. 12 semi-finalists begin riding from the starting line and head up to any of the 12 towers called  Duel Zodiacs  placed in the way. Each Duel Zodiac has a  Star Ticket  with Levels from 1 to 12. A participant may choose to which Duel Zodiac head or which opponent to Duel. By winning a Duel, the participant acquires the Star Ticket inside the Duel Zodiac. Then, after obtaining Star Tickets whose total Levels are 12 or more, a participant heads to the  Duel Gate , which will only open if they have the appropriate Star Tickets, and leads to the final stage of the tournament. 
 The twelve semi-finalists are:
 
 Admire Derby 
 Adolf Mueller 
 Andre 
 Kodou Kinomiya 
 Crow Hogan 
 Jean 
 Ramon Kagura 
 Kalin Kessler 
 Tiger Eyes 
 Tetsu Trudge

 The winner of the whole tournament would face  Jack Atlas  in a rematch Turbo Duel. [4]  However, near its end, Rex and the  Skeleton Knight  start their plan involving the  Ultimate God , putting an end to the tournament; Rex ordered  Lazar  to get rid of the participants, defeating most of them and sealing their souls in cards. The participants which are known to have remained are Yusei, Crow, Tetsu, Kiryu, Leo and Luna, besides the King, Jack. [9] [10] 
 
 History 
 After hearing that  Jack Atlas  had arrived in  Satellite , Goodwin and  Mina Simington  began to carry out their preparations for the tournament. [2]  Invitations were sent out to Turbo Duelists, who mostly lost to Jack Atlas in the past and are likely to want a rematch. [3] 
 The day after  Yusei's  loss to Jack,  Lazar  gave Yusei an invitation to the tournament, addressing him as the best Turbo Duelist in  Satellite  and telling him that Jack would also be participating. [1]  Lazar told Yusei about the tournament and the fame and riches which will be associated with the winner. Yusei said that he has no interest in that, but Lazar asked him if he cares about pride; dueling Jack again could be a chance for Yusei to restore his pride. [4] 
 After facing  Akiza Izinski  in a  One-Shot Run , Yusei decided to enter. [4] 
 At the opening event, Goodwin explained the rules to the contestants and introduces Jack Atlas. Jack recognizes most of the contestants and patronizes them saying that the D1 Grand Prix seems to just be a consolation tournament, but smiles when he sees  Crow Hogan  and  Kalin Kessler . [3] 
 Yusei faces  Greiger  in the first round of the tournament. He arrives late, causing him to lose popularity with the audience. [3]  However, he manages to win.
