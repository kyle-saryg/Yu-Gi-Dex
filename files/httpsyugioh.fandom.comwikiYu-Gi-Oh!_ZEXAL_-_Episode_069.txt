 Summary 
       Dr. Faker  transforms.     
 As  Yuma ,  Shark  and  Kite  hold their  ace cards  aloft, Yuma declares that they've made their decision - with everyone's future at stake, they challenge  Dr. Faker  to a  Duel . Faker agrees, while  Astral , still trapped within the  Sphere Field , simply mutters "Yuma...".  Tori , kneeling by the deactivated  Orbital 7 , tells Yuma to show Faker his strongest " kattobingu ". Faker says he'll crush them to pieces here and now - there is nothing they can do. Yuma insists Faker will be the one crushed to pieces, while Kite vows to make Faker pay. Shark adds that he will crush Faker's boring ambitions. Faker can hardly believe they would oppose him as the Sphere Field glows with pink electricity, which hits Faker. He rises from this throne and his clothes tear as robotic parts are revealed underneath, which expand. A chrome plate latches over Faker's left eye, functioning as his  Duel Gazer . He tells them to come at him - they may all do so at once. Yuma and Shark arm their Duel Gazers and  D-Pads  while Kite undergoes  Photon Transformation , his D-Pad flying in from off-screen. Astral mutters that they'll leave this to three of them - the future is in their hands.
 
         " Number 53: Heart-eartH " is Summoned.     
 Faker says that Yuma, Shark and Kite will share 4000  Life Points , while his own Life Points will be 12000. He continues that he'll go first and show them his "Duel of soul". He  draws  and  sends  the " Garbage Ogre " in his  hand  to the  Graveyard  to add a " Garbage Lord " from his  Deck  to his hand. He reveals he may  pay  1000 Life Points to  Special Summon  "Garbage Lord" from his hand. He pays 3000 Life Points to Special Summon three copies of "Garbage Lord", which appear in  Attack Position . Yuma is surprised at the triple Summon and Kite asks what's he's afraid of. Shark simply comments that something must be coming. Faker  overlays  his three  Level  5  monsters  and fierce winds blare through the room, causing Tori to shout (in the dub, Tori simply braces herself in the winds). Faker tells them to take a look at the strongest " Number ", which stands on a pinnacle above all others. He instructs it to "equip the supernatural armor and shock the world." It begins to form out of mist, as the "Numbers" cards float around Astral in the Sphere Field. Astral appears weaker and comments that the powers of the "Numbers" were absorbed. Finally, the "Number" appears - " Number 53: Heart-eartH ". Shark and Kite comment it has only 100  ATK , while Faker reveals that it is immune to all of their monster,  Spell  and  Trap  effects.  Setting  two cards, Faker ends his  turn .
 Yuma says he'll go next and Shark warns him that there must be something else that "Number" can do. Yuma insists he can defeat since it has only 100 ATK. Faker is pleased his first opponent is Yuma and adds he'll eliminate him first then. Yuma asks how that could happen - he is beside Shark and Kite, his friends that he gained due to Astral. Declaring he'll save Astral for sure, Yuma draws and then  Normal Summons  " Goblindbergh ". Three "Goblinberghs" appear carrying a metal box on chains between them as Yuma explains that when he Summons "Goblindbergh", he can Special Summon a  Level  4 or lower monster from his hand. The box opens and " Gagaga Magician " drops out of it in Attack Position. He overlays his two Level 4 monsters to  Xyz Summon  " Number 39: Utopia " in Attack Position, referring to it as "the bond between me and Astral". Faker isn't surprised to see "Utopia", but  activates  his  face-down   Continuous Trap Card , " Battle Route ". As long as its  face-up  and Faker  controls  a monster, his opponents must attack it with their Attack Position monsters if they choose to conduct a  Battle Phase . 
 
       " Number 39: Utopia "  attacks  "Heart-eartH".     
 Shark is confused as to what Faker is doing. Yuma asks what he means and Kite answers that the "Number" has only 100 ATK - why would he activate a trap that forces  battle ? Yuma asks if his goal is to be attacked then. Kite confirms it, so they cannot let their guard down. Yuma disagrees and immediately declares an attack. Faker says Yuma's ignorance is just as large as  Kazuma 's then. Yuma continues with " Rising Sun Slash ", but Faker reveals one of the effects of "Heart-eartH". When it is attacked, he may  equip  it with a monster from his Graveyard. He equips "Garbage Ogre", who floats upward and is absorbed into the heart of "Heart-eartH". This allows it to gain the  original ATK  of the monster that is attacking it, so its ATK rises to 2600. Kite realizes what Faker was planning now and Shark says that even if that card has low ATK, it can always exceed the ATK of the attacking monster.
 Faker declares " Infernal Surge ", but Yuma activates the effect of "Utopia",  detaching  an Overlay Unit to  negate  his own attack. Shark tells Yuma that was good and that he should continue. Yuma activates " Double or Nothing! ", doubling the ATK of "Utopia" to 5000 and letting it attack again as its attack was negated. He attacks with "Rising Sun Slash" again. Seeing the impact, Yuma says this is his hope. Faker laughs and declares such hope as to be nothing but trash before him. His Life Points at 6600, Faker says he will grind the hope to dust and explains that he can send the equipped monster to the Graveyard to prevent the destruction of "Heart-eartH"  by battle . "Garbage Ogre" falls from the heart of "Heart-eartH" back into the Graveyard portal. When this happens, Faker can inflict  damage  equal to half the amount of the increase in the ATK of "Heart-eartH", which launches a beam from its core, hitting and Yuma and throwing him onto the ground, his team's Life Points at 2750. 
 
         Shark's wound (the blood is cut from the dub).     
 Tori yells Yuma's name and Faker continues he's now using the effect of "Heart-eartH" that requires an Overlay Unit to be detached - he can gain Life Points equal to the damage he inflicted, so his Life Points rise to 7850 as he cackles. Kite and Shark are shocked at these abilities as Astral declares that this truly is the strongest "Number". In pain, Yuma Sets a card and ends his turn. Shark walks forward, telling Yuma he's Dueling as lacklusterly as always, but still saying he did a good job. He draws, claiming he'll bite Faker to pieces with his sharp fangs. He grunts in pain and Yuma asks what's wrong. He claims he's fine, but he's bleeding heavily - he was injured by a  litterbot 's scythe in the battle (the bleeding is cut from the dub).
 
         Yuma complaining that Shark  detached  the  Overlay Unit .     
 Faker asks if Shark is scared. He tells Faker to shut up and Normal Summons " Hammer Shark ". Saying he can use his allies' cards as well, he detaches the remaining Overlay Unit from "Utopia". Yuma is confused and upset, but Shark tells him to stop complaining (in the dub, Yuma also asks why Shark couldn't get any Overlay Units from Kite instead). He reveals that by doing this he can Special Summon " Xyz Remora " from his hand via its own effect. When its Summoned by this effect and he uses it in a Xyz Summon, it can be counted as an additional Overlay Unit for each Unit that was detached in its Summon. He overlays his two Level 4 monsters treated as three to Xyz Summon " Number 32: Shark Drake " in Attack Position. Shark tells Yuma his Dueling has given him in a hint. Yuma is confused but Shark tells him to watch.
 
         " Number 32: Shark Drake " is Summoned.     
 He equips "Utopia" with " Shield Fin " and asks to borrow his monster. He orders an attack with "Utopia", with Faker claiming such an attack can't defeat a genius like him. He uses the effect of "Heart-eartH", equipping "Garbage Ogre". Its ATK rises to 2600 once more. He tells Shark to disappear, while also adding that his lack of attention would cost him, and yells "Infernal Surge!". Shark says he was waiting for that and reveals the effect of "Shield Fin" - until the  End Phase , the original ATK of the equipped monster will become 0 and it cannot be destroyed by battle. The ATK of "Utopia" drops to 0 and with it the ATK of "Heart-eartH" drops to 100, as its effect is based on the original ATK of the monster it battles. Kite compliments him, saying he discovered the weakness of "Heart-eartH". Shark adds they'll still take damage - but only 100. He says all credit for this should go to Yuma - it was Yuma's reckless attack that let him determine the weakness of "Heart-eartH". 
 
         "Heart-eartH" strikes.     
 Saying that the ATK boosting effect of "Heart-eartH" can only be used once per turn and since its ATK wasn't changed, its damage effect also can't be activated, Shark orders "Shark Drake" to attack with " Deep Sea Destruction ". Faker's Life Points fall to 5150, with him chuckling that the hungry shark must smell the blood (in the dub, Faker says that Shark's brain is tinier than he realized). He declares the attack useless and sends the equipped "Garbage Ogre" to the Graveyard again, preventing the destruction by battle. Yuma is unsure how to proceed - Faker keeps recovering. Faker says he'll destroy their hope further and unveils  another  effect of "Heart-eartH". Detaching an Overlay Unit, he can inflict damage equal to half the damage he received. He insists they take his "genius judgment" ("gift" in the dub) and "Heart-eartH" fires another beam from its heart, hitting Shark and dropping the trio's Life Points to 1300. 
 Yuma yells Shark's name, while Shark curses, saying he can't believe that Life Point recovery became an attack. Kite steps forward and glances back at Shark, who Sets a card in response and ends his turn. Kite claims he'll inherit their wills and draws. Faker calls Kite a fool - how dare he oppose him. He says he'll send them all to hell (in the dub, Faker says that when the Duel is over, Kite will lose everything). Kite asks him to spare him the nonsense and raises his hand towards the Sphere Field (the scene showing Hart is cut from the dub). Vowing to save  Hart , he Sets a card. Examining his hand, he sees he has " Galaxy-Eyes Photon Dragon ", " Photon Slasher ", " Photon Prevent ", " Kuriphoton " and " Photon Crusher ". He Normal Summons "Photon Crusher" and reveals that since he controls an  Xyz Monster , he can Special Summon "Photon Slasher" from his hand via its own effect. He  Tributes  them both to Special Summon "Galaxy-Eyes". Tori says their bonds have been integrated now - everyone has their ace monsters out.  
 
         Photon Transformation  continues to take its toll on Kite.     
 Faker addresses Kite as "my foolish son" and urges him to come at him if he has the strength. Kite falls to one knee in pain, but insists he's fine. Faker speculates that it seems that Kite's body has reached its limit due to  "Number" hunting . Yuma says it's all because of Faker and asks if he's really qualified to be a father. Kite claims that due to Faker's sins, he and "Galaxy-Eyes" have been "contaminated" this whole time. He vows to make Faker atone for his sins. Faker questions Kite on how to stop him. Kite thinks, knowing he can use "Shield Fin" to damage Faker, but that still leaves the problem of how to avoid the effect damage afterwards. He asks to borrow Yuma's monster, who agrees. Kite orders "Utopia" to attack, with Faker equipping "Garbage Ogre" again. Kite uses "Shield Fin" in the same way Shark did, so they take only 100 damage from "Infernal Surge". Faker claims they are simply repeating the same stupidity as Kite orders "Shark Drake" to attack with "Deep Sea Destruction". Faker's Life Points fall to 2450 as "Garbage Ogre" falls from "Heart-eartH", preventing its destruction by battle. 
 
         A new " Number " appears.     
 Faker detaches an Overlay Unit to inflict the same amount of damage he received. Yuma says they have only 1200 Life Points, with Astral adding it's over if this hits. Faker tells Kite to kneel before him. Kite says Faker will be the one to kneel and activates "Photon Prevent" negating the effect damage as he controls a " Photon " monster. Shark says he still has "Galaxy-Eyes" left to attack with and Faker has only 2450 Life Points - they can win here. Kite points at Faker, saying he always followed his orders as a Number Hunter without question and hunted the souls of many innocents. He realizes now it never would have helped Hart - Faker deceived him the whole time. He will save the soul of Hart and of many others by defeating Faker. He asks if Faker is ready for his "confession" and orders "Galaxy-Eyes" to attack with " Photon Stream of Destruction ". "Heart-eartH" explodes and Tori says it seems they won then as Yuma dances around, excited to have defeated Faker. As the smoke clears, they see  a purple dragon  sitting there. Yuma wonders if it's a new "Number" as Faker laughs maniacally.
 
 Featured Duel: Dr. Faker vs. Yuma Tsukumo, Reginald "Shark" Kastle and Kite Tenjo 
         Yuma ,  Shark  and  Kite  vs.  Dr. Faker     
 Dr. Faker  begins with 12000  Life Points  while  Yuma ,  Shark  and  Kite  share 4000 Life Points and may use any card their partners  control  as their own.
 Turn 1: Faker 
 
Faker draws "Garbage Ogre". He then  activates  the  effect  of " Garbage Ogre " to  send  it from his hand to the  Graveyard  and  add  " Garbage Lord " from his  Deck  to his hand. Faker activates the effect of his three "Garbage Lords" to  pay  1000 Life Points and  Special Summon  each "Garbage Lord" ( 5/0/2400 each) in  Attack Position  (Faker: 12000 → 9000 LP).                  No. 53 False Skeletal God - Heart-eartH   "Heart-eartH" is Summoned.      Faker  overlays  his three "Garbage Lords" in order to  Xyz Summon  " Number 53: Heart-eartH " ( 5/100/100, ORU: 3) in Attack Position. Due to the second effect of "Heart-eartH", it is unaffected by the opponent's card effects. Faker  Sets  two cards.
 Turn 2: Yuma 
Yuma draws. He then  Normal Summons  " Goblindbergh " ( 4/1400/0) in Attack Position. As "Goblindbergh" was Normal Summoned, Yuma activates its effect to Special Summon " Gagaga Magician " ( 4/1500/1000) in Attack Position. Yuma overlays "Goblindbergh" and "Gagaga Magician" in order to Xyz Summon " Number 39: Utopia " ( 4/2500/2000, ORU: 2) in Attack Position. 
 Faker activates his  face-down  " Battle Route ". Now as long as Faker controls a monster, all his opponent's face-up Attack Position monsters must attack, if able during their  Battle Phase . "Utopia"  attacks  "Heart-eartH", but Faker activates the third effect of "Heart-eartH",  equipping  the "Garbage Ogre" in his Graveyard to it and increasing the ATK of "Heart-eartH" by the current ATK of the attacking monster ("Heart-eartH": 100 → 2600 ATK). Yuma activates the effect of "Utopia" to  detach  an Overlay Unit ("Utopia": 2 → 1 ORU) and  negate  the attack. 
 Yuma activates " Double or Nothing! " to double the ATK of "Utopia" ("Utopia": 2500 → 5000 ATK) and allow it to attack again as its attack was negated. "Utopia" attacks "Heart-eartH", but Faker activates the fifth effect of "Heart-eartH", sending the equipped "Garbage Ogre" to the Graveyard ("Heart-eartH": 2600 → 100 ATK) in order to prevent "Heart-eartH" from being  destroyed by battle  (Faker: 9000 → 6600 LP). As the equipped "Garbage Ogre" was sent to the Graveyard, the sixth effect of "Heart-eartH" activates, inflicting  damage  to Faker's opponents equal to half the difference between its original ATK and previous ATK (Yuma, Shark and Kite: 4000 → 2750 LP). Faker activates the seventh effect of "Heart-eartH" to detach an Overlay Unit ("Heart-eartH": 3 → 2 ORU) and gain Life Points equal to the damage he inflicted (Faker: 6600 → 7850 LP). At the end of the Damage Step, the effect of "Double or Nothing!" expires ("Utopia": 5000 → 2500 ATK). Yuma Sets a card.
 Turn 3: Shark 
Shark draws. He then Normal Summons " Hammer Shark " ( 4/1700/1500) in Attack Position. Shark detaches the remaining Overlay Unit from "Utopia" ("Utopia": 1 → 0 ORU) in order to Special Summon " Xyz Remora " ( 4/800/800) in Attack Position via its own effect. As "Xyz Remora" was Summoned through its own effect, it can reduce the number of monsters required for the Xyz Summon of a  WATER   Xyz Monster  by the number of Overlay Units that were detached for it summon. Shark overlays "Hammer Shark" and "Xyz Remora" in order to Xyz Summon " Number 32: Shark Drake " ( 4/2800/2100, ORU: 2) in Attack Position. Shark equips "Utopia" with " Shield Fin ". Now when a card or effect is activated during the Battle Phase, Shark can reduce the original ATK of the equipped monster to 0, and prevent it from being destroyed by battle, 
 "Utopia" attacks "Heart-eartH", but Faker activates the third effect of "Heart-eartH" by equipping the "Garbage Ogre" in his Graveyard to it ("Heart-eartH": 100 → 2600 ATK). Shark activates the effect of "Shield Fin" ("Utopia": 2500 → 0 ATK; "Heart-eartH": 2600 → 100 ATK) to prevent "Utopia" from being destroyed by battle (Yuma, Shark and Kite: 2750 → 2650 LP). "Shark Drake" attacks "Heart-eartH", but Faker sends "Garbage Ogre" to the Graveyard to prevent "Heart-eartH" from being destroyed by battle (Faker: 7850 → 5150 LP). As Faker took  Battle Damage , he activates the eighth effect of "Heart-eartH" to detach an Overlay Unit ("Heart-eartH": 2 → 1 ORU) and inflict damage to his opponents equal to half the damage he took (Yuma, Shark and Kite: 2650 → 1300 LP). Shark Sets a card. On Shark's End Phase, the effect of "Shield Fin" expires ("Utopia": 0 → 2500 ATK).
 Turn 4: Kite 
Kite draws. He then Sets a card. Kite's hand contains " Galaxy-Eyes Photon Dragon ", "Photon Slasher", "Photon Prevent", " Kuriphoton " and " Photon Crusher ". Kite Normal Summons "Photon Crusher" ( 4/2000/0) in Attack Position. As he controls an Xyz Monster, Kite Special Summons " Photon Slasher " ( 5/2100/1000) in  Defense Position  via its own effect. Kite then  Tributes  "Photon Crusher" and "Photon Slasher" in order to Special Summon "Galaxy-Eyes Photon Dragon" ( 8/3000/2500) in Attack Position via its own effect (as the Tributed monsters had at least 2000 ATK). "Utopia" attacks "Heart-eartH", but Faker activates the third effect of "Heart-eartH" by equipping the "Garbage Ogre" in his Graveyard to it ("Heart-eartH": 100 → 2600 ATK). Kite activates the effect of "Shield Fin" ("Utopia": 2500 → 0 ATK; "Heart-eartH": 2600 → 100 ATK) to prevent "Utopia" from being destroyed by battle (Yuma, Shark and Kite: 1300 → 1200 LP). 
 "Shark Drake" attacks "Heart-eartH", but Faker sends "Garbage Ogre" to the Graveyard to prevent "Heart-eartH" from being destroyed by battle (Faker: 5150 → 2450 LP). Faker then activates the eighth effect of "Heart-eartH" ("Heart-eartH": 1 → 0 ORU), but Kite activates " Photon Prevent " to take no damage from the effect of "Heart-eartH" as he controls a " Photon " monster. "Galaxy-Eyes Photon Dragon" attacks "Heart-eartH", but Faker activates the final effect of "Heart-eartH" (as the latter card has no Overlay Units) to Xyz Summon " Number 92: Heart-eartH Dragon " in Attack Position and  attach  "Heart-eartH" to it as an Overlay Unit ( 9/0/0, ORU: 1).
 Duel continues in  the next episode .
