 Team 5D's  was a team in the  World Racing Grand Prix  composed of the protagonists in  Yu-Gi-Oh! 5D's . With the exception of Bruno, all members of Team 5D's were Signers.
 According to  Crow ,  Jack Atlas  was the one who chose the team name, although Jack claims that Crow suggested it and that it was better than using a common name. When  Leo  asks what it means,  Bruno  jokes about it, resulting in Jack hitting him in the head twice. Jack reveals the true meaning of the name, by showing his  Mark of the Dragon , to which  Yusei  explains that their bonds were formed because of the  Crimson Dragon .

 Leo remarks that he doesn't have a mark, although he recalls that he and  Luna  wouldn't have met everyone else if it wasn't for her birthmark. Jack still tells Leo that he is included with Luna on the team, as well as Bruno. After that, Yusei says that from that day forward they are all officially "Team 5D's". In the team,  Bruno ,  Leo , and  Luna  act as the pit crew, while  Jack ,  Crow ,  Yusei , and  Akiza  are the duelists.
 After they won the WRGP, they celebrated their victory, just before the  Divine Temple  appeared.
 After  Z-one 's defeat, Yusei suggested for the gang to see each other again, after having seen Crow troubled. [1]  Because they all had diverse goals in life, Jack decided they have reached the ends of their point as a team and being a team now, would hold them all back, to which they all reluctantly agreed. Following Yusei and Jack's Duel, the team parts ways, leaving New Domino city to follow their individual dreams, while Yusei stayed behind to protect the city. [2]
