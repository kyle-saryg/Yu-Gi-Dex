 Lyrics 
 
 Welcome all my honored guests 
To the ultimate Duel with the best of the best 
At my invitation you've come to compete 
For the honor of suffering the final defeat 
 
Isn't it grand what I've managed to do 
By kidnapping those closest to you? 
I've taken their souls to lay on the line 
In a winner take all Duel for all time 
 
Let's play the game 
I'm sure you all know how 
But watch yourselves my foolish friends 
You're all in my world now 
 
 CHORUS 
 Face up ,  Face down .  Attack  or  Defend 
Face up, Face down. This battle's to the end 
Face up, Face down. Stay on guard 
Face up, Face down. Play your strongest card 
 
(H-Hmmhmmhmmhmm) 
 
My arena awaits us all 
I built it myself, it's just down the hall 
I wish this day hadn't come so fast 
You see, I truly wanted your pain to last 
(Hahahahahaha) 
 
 CHORUS 
 
All your cunning strategies, all the tricks you try 
Look like merely child's play to my  Millennium Eye 
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha! Your turn,  Yugi-boy 
 
What's wrong now?  You look so sad 
Losing your soul doesn't feel that bad 
Those you love have told me so 
And soon my friends, you too will know 
 
Let's play the game 
I'm sure you all know how 
But watch yourselves my foolish friends 
You're all in my world now 
 
 CHORUS repeats until fade
