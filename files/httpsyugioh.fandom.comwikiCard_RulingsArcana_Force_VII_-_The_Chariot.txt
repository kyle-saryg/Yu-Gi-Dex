 The monster effect " When this card is Summoned, toss a coin " is a  Trigger Effect  that is always activated when " Arcana Force VII - The Chariot " is successfully  Normal ,  Flip , or  Special Summoned . (It does not  target .) [1] 
 When the effect resolves, toss a coin, and which effect is gained is determined by the result. [1] 
 The monster effect " Heads: If this card destroys an opponent's monster by battle, you can Special Summon that monster to your side of the field " is a  Trigger Effect . (It does not  target . If the " Arcana Force VII - The Chariot " itself that gained the effect destroys an opponent's monster by battle, at the end of the  Damage Step  the effect can optionally be activated. [1] 
 If the " Arcana Force VII - The Chariot " itself that gained the effect has the same ATK as the monster it battles, the monster effect " you can Special Summon that monster to your side of the field " cannot be activated. [1]

 Previously Official Rulings 
   These TCG rulings were issued by  Upper Deck Entertainment  and have since been deemed unofficial by Konami. [2]  They were previously considered official and can still be correct, as long as they follow the official gameplay rules, or unless Konami has issued a ruling that says otherwise.

 " Arcana Force VII - The Chariot 's" heads effect activates at the end of the  Damage Step , when the monster it destroys in battle is sent to the Graveyard or Removed Zone. 
 If " Reversal of Fate " changes " Arcana Force VII - The Chariot 's" effect from heads to tails, control of " Arcana Force VII - The Chariot " immediately shifts to the opponent. If its effect is changed to heads again after control is shifted to the opponent, it remains under the opponent's control.
