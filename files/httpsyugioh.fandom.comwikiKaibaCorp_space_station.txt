 Events 
 Kaiba was first seen observing a virtual reconstruction of the Millennium Puzzle on the station. He later Dueled and defeated a virtual reconstruction of Atem on-board the station, but he was unsatisfied with the victory, believing it to be inferior to the real thing. After retrieving the fragments of the  Millennium Puzzle , Kaiba gave the A.I. of the station the Millennium Puzzle pieces to rebuild. The A.I. was able to reconstruct the puzzle, apart from two pieces. 
 After his efforts to revive Atem with the Puzzle failed, Kaiba obtained  Diva 's  Quantum Cube . Aboard the station, Kaiba spoke to  Mokuba  about a system. Mokuba warned Kaiba that the system was untested but Kaiba continued with it anyway. With the system connected to the Quantum Cube, Kaiba traveled down the elevator at high speed to cross into what seemed to be the underworld.
