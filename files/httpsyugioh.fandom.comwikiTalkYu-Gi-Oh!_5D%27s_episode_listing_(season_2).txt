 Arc Name 
 Anyone have any idea what this arc's called? My money's on either Placido's Arc or Infinity Arc. -- Blackstone Dresden  21:24, 8 July 2009 (UTC)
 Since its has just began there`s no telling but you betcha its gonna have to do with that Infinity symbol we have watch. As it appears that the monsters this 3 new bad guys use revolve on it.  DracoX  02:39, 9 July 2009 (UTC)
 
 Actually since next week's episode skips forward a year, the smart money's on calling this the World Riding Grand Prix Arc -- Blackstone Dresden  17:22, 22 July 2009 (UTC) 
 It would appear so as betting on too as the end of new intro shows Yusei, Jack and Crow all propertalry geared up and ready for this event (not forgeting Luna and Akiza dressed as cheerleaders and Leo too in a racing engineer suit), but will have to see as the whole appearance of this 3 Yliaster members and the Infinity theme symbols its hard to categorize for the moment.  DracoX  18:06, 22 July 2009 (UTC)
 According to 4Kids, the arc is called "Road to Destiny" and  Episode 65  starts on September 18th, 2010. All info on this link:  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Yu-Gi-Oh!_5D%27s_episodes_%28season_3%29  -- Red-Eyes Black Dragon  ( talk  •  contribs ) 22:46, September 4, 2010 (UTC)
 
 I see. Thank you. Wikipedia itself isn't a primary source, but one of the editors mentioned  this  as a source. It's reliable isn't it? And "Road to Destiny"  seems to be correct  too. --  Deltaneos  ( talk ) 23:47, September 4, 2010 (UTC) 
 I know Wikipedia isn't that resourceful, but I just felt like showing what I researched. That's all. -- Red-Eyes Black Dragon  ( talk  •  contribs ) 02:30, September 7, 2010 (UTC) 
 Wikipedia is good. What I meant was something appearing on Wikipedia isn't proof itself, since anyone can post anything there. (Same with this site). We need to see where Wikipedia is getting the information from to verify if it's true. Anyway Wikipedia was right in this case. --  Deltaneos  ( talk ) 12:26, September 7, 2010 (UTC) 
 Good point Deltaneos. :P -- Red-Eyes Black Dragon  ( talk  •  contribs ) 20:37, September 9, 2010 (UTC) 
 Question about Crow 
 Now that Crow has his  Blackfeather Dragon  as his ace card isn't the scene in the beginning of the theme song supposed to change with Crow holding Blackfeather Dragon instead of  Blackwing Armor Master ?
 We'll likely see Crow with Blackfeather Dragon in the new OP in episode 104.-- 71.80.67.80  05:10, March 27, 2010 (UTC)
 
 Episode Airdate Change 
 It was recently confirmed on janime that episode 134 will be delayed a week due to a baseball game.  The episode's airdate (and 135's airdate-- 68.119.115.158  ( talk ) 05:30, October 17, 2010 (UTC) as well) should be changed.
 
 One Point Lesson Cards 
 I keep seeing one point lesson cards on episode pages and i have no idea what they are can some one tell me please.   Keeota1012   —Preceding undated comment added 14:38, 5 March 2011 (UTC) 
 
 The TV Tokyo website does a one point lesson on each episode. It usually showcases about three cards. Sometimes more, sometimes less. You can see the lessons  here . Although I think you need some software like a certain version of Flash installed to see it. I'm not able to see it, but the cards can be viewed  here . Just change the number to match the episode. --  Deltaneos  ( talk ) 21:15, March 5, 2011 (UTC) 
 episode 97? 
 why doesn't episode 97 have an English air date but it has the English title-- Imhungry4444  ( talk  •  contribs ) 07:45, March 8, 2011 (UTC)
 
 what happened? 
 does anybody know why most of the stuff on the page is missing? the road to destiny and the WRPG sections have nothing and the ark cradle only has three episodes.-- Soul reaper magnum  ( talk  •  contribs ) 14:39, March 16, 2011 (UTC)
 
 There were problems with SMW, the extension used to make this list, yesterday. It's fixed now, but the cache is still outdated. i.e. until the job queue is cleared or a page is edited, the page is being treated the way it was when there were problems. 
 In simpler terms, this page is getting information from each episode article (number, name screenshot etc.). The episode pages are being treated as not having that information, because of problems we had yesterday. But they regain that information if any sort of edit is made to the episode page (even clicking edit, then save/publish without making changes). The three episodes that are appearing now have been edited since the problem was fixed. 
 If you wait long enough, every page will automatically fix itself (when the job queue is run). But if you absolutely must see an episode on this list, edit its page and then  refresh  this one. --  Deltaneos  ( talk ) 16:40, March 16, 2011 (UTC) 
 oh ok, i didn't know if someone vandalized it or if there was another problem so that's why i asked.-- Soul reaper magnum  ( talk  •  contribs ) 16:44, March 16, 2011 (UTC)
 
 
 Missing Episodes 
 Any particular reason big chunks of episodes are missing? Hmmm? -- Thanonyx  ( talk  •  contribs ) 01:31, March 19, 2011 (UTC)
 
 See the  above section . --  Deltaneos  ( talk ) 11:06, March 19, 2011 (UTC) 
 Editing the images 
 I uploaded a LQ Image from the preview for ep 153 but I can't figure this page out.  Mattwo  ( talk  •  contribs ) 09:39, March 23, 2011 (UTC)
 
 When you change the infobox image on the episode page, this page automatically updates itself. But it's not always instantaneously visible, so you might need to " refresh " this page to see the newest version. --  Deltaneos  ( talk ) 13:10, March 23, 2011 (UTC) 
 Dub ending early 
 I got a question. My tv guide for next week says that their showing both parts of fight for the future I was wondering are they going to end 5d's at that like they ended GX at the third season?-- Ovidkid  ( talk  •  contribs ) 16:08, September 3, 2011 (UTC)
 
 Which date is that because they're currently listed as having separate air dates here. It would be nice if that could be cleared-up. Does the guide say that they won't be showing an episode the week after? 
 To answer your question, they might be, but 4Kids usually take a break between arcs. That could mean they'll dub the next arc later or move on to  ZEXAL  before finishing  5D's  or stop dubbing  Yu-Gi-Oh!  after their legal battle with TV Tokyo. 
 On a related note, if 4Kids are stopping at 136, should we say that the Ark Cradle arc begins at episode 137 rather than 138? Episode 137 is odd in that it both finishes the WRGP storyline and begins the Ark Cradle one. --  Deltaneos  ( talk ) 17:29, September 3, 2011 (UTC)
 My guide only goes up to eight day later for the most part so I don't know for sure. It just seems like they are in a rush to finish. I mean first they skip a lot of episodes then they do a two new episodes in a row of that end an arc plus the legal battle they had with tv tokyo just got me thinking they might end 5d's earlier like they did with GX. I really like 5d's and barely watched any ZEXAL episode so I hate for them to end the dub early and ruin it for people that don't watch any of the original jap like they did for GX (plus it might mean we won't get tag force 6 in NA like tf3).-- Ovidkid  ( talk  •  contribs ) 17:48, September 3, 2011 (UTC) 
 Episode edit 
 Can somebody put 137 in the Ark Cradle Ark (that episode was not only not dubbed, but that's when the Ark Cradle first appears in reality as well)?  Shardsilver  ( talk  •  contribs ) 17:22, March 31, 2013 (UTC)
 
 Going by the pattern of opening/closing themes, the arc should actually start from  Yu-Gi-Oh! 5D's - Episode 130 . We'll get around to it eventually today. -- UltimateKuriboh  ( talk  •  contribs ) 17:36, March 31, 2013 (UTC)
