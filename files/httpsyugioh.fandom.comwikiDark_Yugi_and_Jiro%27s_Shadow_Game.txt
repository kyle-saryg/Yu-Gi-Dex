 Prior 
 Jiro the Jorogumo   escaped  from prison, disguised as  Tetsu Tasaki , who also escaped. Jiro had a plastic surgery and became a staff member at  Burger World , where Tetsu frequently went disguised for a meal. Jiro quickly saw through Tetsu's disguises, and whenever Tetsu planned a crime Jiro beat him to do it yet the crimes were blamed on Tetsu.
 After the  detective  arrived and alerted the staff that there was reason to believe Tetsu was in the restaurant, Jiro cooperated in the search to find which customer he was. However Tetsu resisted arrest and was able to expose Jiro in the process.
 Jiro then took  Anzu Mazaki  hostage, had her blindfold herself, and forced  Yugi Muto  to serve himself alcohol and cigarettes. Yugi switched to  Dark Yugi  and challenged Jiro to the game. Jiro put the cigarette in his mouth and began pouring his drink.
 
 Game 
       Jiro, unable to pull the trigger without setting himself alight     
 When the game began, Dark Yugi explained that the only rule is that each player must select a finger and must not move any other. Jiro choose to use his right index finger, thinking he could just shoot Dark Yugi. Dark Yugi choose his thumb.
 As Jiro was about to pull the trigger, Dark Yugi used his thumb to switch on a cigarette lighter. Jiro allowed Dark Yugi to light his cigarette as the last thing he did before dying. However, after doing so, Dark Yugi placed the lighter on the Jiro's left arm, which was still pouring his alcohol. The vodka in his glass began to overflow and spill on Jiro. Dark Yugi warned him that by shooting, the recoil would knock the lighter and set the vodka on fire.
 Dark Yugi stood up and escorted Anzu, who was still blindfolded, away. Jiro took the lighter off his hand, using more than his chosen finger and then angrily pointed the gun at Dark Yugi. However, for cheating, Dark Yugi inflicted a  Penalty Game , causing Jiro to believe he was set alight.
 
 
 Aftermath 
 Anzu quit her job at Burger World, so she could spend more time with Yugi, but still had no knowledge of who saved her.
