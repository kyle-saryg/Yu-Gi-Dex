 Featured Duel: Yami Yugi vs. Seto Kaiba 
 Duel continues from previous episode. 
 Yugi has 1500  Life Points  remaining and controls "Dark Magician" (2500/2100) and "Red-Eyes Black Dragon" (2400/2000) in Attack Position and one set card.
 Kaiba has 1900 Life Points remaining and controls two "Blue-Eyes White Dragons" (3000/2500 for both) in Attack Position and " Spell Sanctuary ".
 Turn 20: Kaiba 
One of Kaiba's " Blue-Eyes White Dragon " has just been destroyed in battle by " Red-Eyes Black Dragon ". He sets two cards.
 Turn 21: Yami Yugi 
Yami Yugi draws "Double Spell". He then Sets a card and switches "Red-Eyes Black Dragon" to  Defense Position . Seto then activates his face-down " Final Attack Orders ", which forces all face-up monsters into  Attack Position  and makes both players pick three cards in their  Deck  to keep in their Deck while sending the remaining cards that were not picked to the Graveyard.
 Turn 22: Kaiba 
Two turns have passed since " Card of Demise 's" activation: in three turns Seto must discard his entire hand. Kaiba draws " Monster Reborn " and subsequently activates it to revive "Blue-Eyes White Dragon" (3000/2500) in Attack Position. Kaiba then activates his face-down " Polymerization " to fuse his three "Blue-Eyes White Dragons" together and Fusion Summon " Blue-Eyes Ultimate Dragon " (4500/3800) in Attack Position. Under  Battle City Rules ,  Fusion Monsters  cannot attack the same turn they are  summoned . 
 Yami Yugi then activates his face-down " Double Spell " to activate any  Spell Card  Seto activated this turn as his cards. Yugi uses the effect of "Double Spell" to activate Seto's "Monster Reborn" and revive " Buster Blader " (2600/2300) in  Attack Position . Yugi then uses the effect of "Double Spell" to activate Seto's "Polymerization", allowing Yami Yugi to fuse " Dark Magician " and "Buster Blader" together and Fusion Summon " Dark Paladin " (2900/2400) in Attack Position. Due to the effect of "Dark Paladin", its  ATK  increases by 500 for each  Dragon - Type  monster on the field. There are currently two ("Dark Paladin": 2900 → 3900/2400).
 Turn 23: Yami Yugi 
Yami Yugi draws. He then Sets a card.
 Turn 24: Kaiba 
Three turns have passed since the activation of "Card of Demise": in two turns Seto must discard his entire hand. Kaiba draws "Absorb Spell". "Blue-Eyes Ultimate Dragon" attacks "Red-Eyes B. Dragon", but Yugi activates his face-down " Magic Formula " in order to equip it to "Dark Paladin" and increase the ATK of "Dark Paladin" by 500, however Seto activates " Absorb Spell " to equip "Magic Formula" onto "Blue-Eyes Ultimate Dragon", ignoring the target requirements ("Blue-Eyes Ultimate Dragon": 4500 → 5000/3800). 
 Yugi then activates his face-down " De-Fusion " to return "Blue-Eyes Ultimate Dragon" to the Fusion Deck and Special Summon all three "Blue-Eyes White Dragons" (3000/2500 for all) from the Graveyard to Kaiba's side of the field in Attack Position ("Dark Paladin": 2900 → 4900/2400). Since "Blue-Eyes Ultimate Dragon" was removed from the field when it attacked, the attack is negated.
 Turn 25: Yami Yugi 
Yami Yugi draws " Diffusion Wave-Motion " and subsequently activates it to pay 1000 Life Points ( Yugi  1500 → 500) and allow "Dark Paladin" to attack all of Seto’s monsters once each (NOTE 1: " Diffusion Wave-Motion " was not really necessary, since simply attacking one "Blue-Eyes White Dragon" would have won Yugi the duel; this is presumably done for dramatic effect.). "Dark Paladin" attacks & destroys all three "Blue-Eyes White Dragons" ( Seto  1900 → 0 → 0 → 0). 
 
 Differences in adaptations 
 When  Joey  wakes up, cut is a shot of him telling  Tristan  what happened in his dream whilst he was unconscious. 
 " Final Attack Orders " is given a slight redesign in the dub. 
 When  Yugi  thinks of  Kaiba 's strategy that he will use " Monster Reborn " and " Polymerization ", the two cards are shown flying across Yugi in the English Version. 
 In the original, right before "Dark Paladin" attacks Kaiba's three "Blue-Eyes White Dragons", Yugi is thinking about how Kaiba Duels with hatred and anger.  In the dub, it instead has Kaiba defiantly shouting that he will not be defeated in his own tournament. 
 Notes 
 Yami Yugi is shown removing his three cards from "Final Attack Orders" from a fairly complete Deck. However, over the course of the Duel, his Deck should be mostly depleted - he starts by drawing five cards (5), has taken 12 turns (12), added " Change of Heart " through " Spell Sanctuary " (1), loses " Slifer the Sky Dragon " through " Lullaby of Obedience " (1), Summoned " King's Knight " from the Deck via " Soul Rope " (1), Summoned " Jack's Knight " from the Deck (1), drawn two cards from " Pot of Greed " (2), drawn three cards from " Card Destruction " (3), and drawn six cards from " Card of Sanctity " (6). 5+12+1+1+1+1+2+3+6=32, meaning that Yami Yugi would be discarding only 5 cards, assuming a 40-card Deck. Of course, it is possible that his Deck is larger than forty cards, to compliment the large number of drawing-related cards featured in it. 
 Errors 
 When the camera is closing in on Yugi after Final Attack Orders is activated, his Dark Magician is absent. 
 After Kaiba summons " Blue-Eyes Ultimate Dragon ", " Blue-Eyes White Dragon " is seen on his  Duel Disk  instead. The same error is shown again after Yugi activated De-Fusion before Blue-Eyes Ultimate Dragon leaves the field. 
 After Yugi defeats Kaiba, Yugi's duel disk is shown to have no cards on the field. However in the next episode when talking to Kaiba about his " Red-Eyes Black Dragon ", his Red-Eyes and " Dark Paladin " is shown to still be on the duel disk. 
 In the dub, when Yugi braces himself after Kaiba plays "Monster Reborn", for at least one frame, the edited cards fail to match up to where they are on Yugi's Duel Disk, revealing the Japanese "Dark Magician" and "Red-Eyes Black Dragon" cards briefly.
