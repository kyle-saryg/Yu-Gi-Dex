 Previously Official Rulings 
   These TCG rulings were issued by  Upper Deck Entertainment  and have since been deemed unofficial by Konami. [1]  They were previously considered official and can still be correct, as long as they follow the official gameplay rules, or unless Konami has issued a ruling that says otherwise. References:  [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] 
 
 " Arcana Call " targets 1 " Arcana Force " monster you control and 1 " Arcana Force " monster in the Graveyard. 
 If an effect is chained that removes the " Arcana Force " monster from the Graveyard, the effect of " Arcana Call " disappears. 
 The heads/tails effect of the " Arcana Force " monster you control is replaced by the effect of the removed from play " Arcana Force " monster. It does not have both effects simultaneously. The monster’s original heads/tails effect is reapplied when " Arcana Call 's" effect disappears in the End Phase. 
 Mentions in Other Rulings 
 Light Barrier : If an " Arcana Force " monster's effect is chosen in this way, it cannot be selected with ... " Arcana Call ".
