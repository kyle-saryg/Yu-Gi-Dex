 Etymology 
 The name " Ghoti " is based on how the phonemes  gh ,  o  and  ti  in the  English language  can be arranged to form a "word" pronounced the same way as "fish", by bending the rules of pronunication -  gh  is normally only pronounced  f  at the end of a word (such as "tough"), while  o  and  ti  are only pronounced  i  and  sh  respectively in the middle of their words (such as "women" and "nation" respectively). Additionally, the names of each  " Ghoti" monster, except  Ghoti of the Deep Beyond , is an anagram.
