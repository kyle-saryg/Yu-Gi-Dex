 Brother's Bond!! 
 
 "Syrus vs. Chazz!!" , known as  "Manjome vs. Sho!!"  in the Japanese version, is the twenty-fifth chapter of the  Yu-Gi-Oh! GX  manga . It was first printed in Japanese in  V Jump  magazine and in English in  Shonen Jump  magazine. Both of which were printed in  volume 3  of the  Yu-Gi-Oh! GX  graphic novels afterwards.
 
 Summary 
 Alexis Rhodes , frustrated over her defeat but determined to become stronger, encounters  Zane Truesdale  in the hall as  Bastion Misawa  eavesdrops. She suggests that Zane is there to see his brother,  Syrus  and says that Syrus has grown stronger since coming to the academy. Syrus begins his Duel with  Chazz Princeton , the last match of the quarterfinals. Syrus  Summons  " Strikeroid " in  Attack Position  and  Sets  a card, determined to win the tournament and stand before his brother as a great duelist. Chazz Summons " Spined Lindworm ", who  attacks  and  destroys  "Strikeroid", with Syrus  activating  his  face-down  " Support Mission ", moving " Stealthroid " from his  Deck  to his  hand . He also activates "Strikeroid's" effect,  paying  800  Life Points  to put it back in his hand.
 Based on his own Duel with him,  David Rabb  considers Syrus a weak duelist, commenting that once you figure out what he has, he's easy to defeat. Syrus Summons "Stealthroid" in  Defense Position  and Sets two cards. Chazz Summons " Guivre " and activates " Dragons Unite ",  equipping  it to "Guivre", who gains 400  ATK  for each  Dragon - Type   monster  he  controls , giving it 2100 ATK. "Guivre" attacks and destroys "Stealthroid", but Syrus activates his face-down " Mechanic's Soul ",  sending  " Turboroid " from his Deck to the Graveyard to prevent "Stealthroid's" destruction. "Guivre's" effect activates,  Special Summoning  a " Wyvern Token ".  Reggie MacKenzie  senses a strange feeling coming from Chazz, and remembers David having had told her about a dragon spirit. Seeing Chazz's Dragon Deck, she wonders if he has the spirit. Syrus activates his face-down " Roid Reinforcements ", sending  one card in his hand to the Graveyard to add "Turboroid" from his Graveyard to his hand. He then plays " Escape " to return "Stealthroid" to his hand.
 Syrus claims he now has his three mightiest  roids  in his hand, and has Chazz beat. He sends all three from his hand to the Graveyard to Special Summon " Solidroid α " in Attack Position, whose effect activates, increasing its ATK points by that of "Spined Lindworm" until the  End Phase , giving it 4500 ATK. "Solidroid" attacks and destroys "Lindworm", dealing Chazz 2600 damage. Chazz recalls he had not considered Syrus to be anything but a  Slifer Red  who would always be behind  Jaden Yuki , but now realizes that since Syrus' own Duel with Jaden, he's changed. He comments that when one Duels Jaden, they change in one way or another. He accepts Syrus as another rival he needs to surpass, and begins his turn. Chazz  Tributes  the "Wyvern Token" and "Guivre" to Summon " Light and Darkness Dragon ", confirming Reggie's suspicions and shocking David. "Light and Darkness Dragon" attacks and destroys "Solidroid".
