 I was talking with a friend, and double checked on YVD, the arch-type name may not actually be "Natural", but instead be "Naturu", which I looked up on Google and is an island or place near or on Fiji.   Ryuuzaki Mockingbird  18:54, 20 December 2008 (UTC)
 
 Yo, Atem here, the guy responsible for that YVD entry. Yes, it's Naturu. Natural is a fanlation that got way, way out of hand, and I've yet to contain it simply because people will downright choose a name they prefer to a name that fits. (No one likes to call Angel-Knight Parshath as anything but "Heavenly Knight Perseus", after all.) Anyway, I'll be dropping some notice for the page to be fixed as well.  99.148.193.14  02:11, 22 June 2009 (UTC)

 Why not adding an image of a Naturia Monster Card? (I already added one but it was removed by someone)  Tersos  17:11, December 14, 2009 (UTC)
 
 I just added a good one of  Naturia Forest .  - Falzar FZ - ( talk page | useful stuff )  06:06, December 1, 2010 (UTC)

 Naturia look down 
 I was wondering way Naturia fruitfly, bamboo shoot, mantis, landois lock down was not mentioned in the article. This lock down makes it so spells, traps, monsters, and effects are useless.

 Japanese name 
 Okay, is the Japanese name Natur, based on the phoetic,  Nachuru," or Natural, Nature etc.?  Mad Rest  22:16, July 19, 2012 (UTC) 
 It has no English equivalent. The OCG made up the word to make it sound fancy. I suggest that we should go with "Naturu" as Pharoah Atem from Neo Ark Cradle suggested above.    HHT     - ( Talk to the Turtle ) 13:55, July 23, 2012 (UTC)
 
 I believe it is "Natural" Because, the pt names are never updated and most of the times it isn't right. Before i updated them, all naturia cards had "Natural" on their pt name.-- Laggia   Will Lag You ( Talk )  13:57, July 23, 2012 (UTC) 
 Yes, but that name was probably wrong, 'cause the phonetic doesn't fit. It should've been  Nachuraru , not  Nachuru .  Mad Rest  01:39, July 27, 2012 (UTC) 
 I'd like to reopen this discussion because someone "with more knowledge of JP than you ever hope to know" isn't quite happy with the current translation. From what I know about Japanese, there are two possibilities: the name "Nachuru" could come from a transcription of the French word "nature" as "nachuuru" (ナチュール, with a long u), or from the English word "natural", as "nachuraru" (minus the "ra"). Either way, it is not a real word, and it must have been intended that way, much like " Ritua " from "Ritual". I'd propose keeping it as "Natul", or literally anything else other than "Natural" because a regular-**s English word would rob the name of its distinctiveness.

 I think I will agree with Atem in the end. Since if it was Natural, then it would make cards like  Natural Disaster  a part of the archetype which it is not. However Natul makes 0 sense. If you type "naturu japan" into google maps it will point you to Mount Fuji. Yes... natul japan gives the same result, but naturu feels more graceful.

 "However Natul makes 0 sense" You are making 0 sense, it's not even clear what you're talking about based on your weird phrasing. Japanese card names are known to based on puns and they aren't real words. I'm not sure what the point of looking for "naturu japan" on Google Maps is. What does it have to do with anything? ナチュル is, and I can't believe I have to stress this again, NOT A REAL WORD. Whatever1234567  ( talk  •  contribs ) 05:29, May 11, 2019 (UTC)
