 "Darkness"  (ダークネス  Dākunesu ) is an  archetype  of cards used by  Nightshroud  (whose own Japanese name is also "Darkness") in the  Yu-Gi-Oh! GX  anime. In the  OCG , the archetype is exclusively supported by  Boss Duel  cards.
 In the anime, it revolves around the " Darkness "  Field Spell ,  swarming  the field with " Darkness Necroslime " and recovering the  controller 's  Life Points .
 So far, the only "Darkness"  monsters  used by Nightshroud that have been released in the  OCG  or  TCG  (excluding Boss Duel cards) are " Darkness Destroyer ", " Darkness Neosphere ",  " Red-Eyes Darkness Dragon " and " Red-Eyes Darkness Metal Dragon ", although other cards can be  supported  by the anime-only support cards.
