 Biography 
 History 
       Sera and her cohabitants, rescued by  Shadi Shin .     
 Sera, her brother,  Diva ,  Mani  and other orphans lived with an  abusive man , until  Shadi Shin  arrived, granted them the power of the Prana and killed the man. [2] 
 One day, when Shadi was teaching the kids about the  Millennium Items ,  Dark Bakura  murdered Shadi, along with some of the orphans, with Aigami, Sera, and Mani the only survivors. Aigami, Sera and Mani resided with a group of children, in the  Prana Realm . Aigami and Sera decided to leave one day and went with a group of children. Mani also left to keep an eye on them. [2] 
 
 Transcend Game 
       Kaiba admires Prana's dangerous element, but is also cautious of it.     
 Sera was a successful applicant for testing  KaibaCorp 's  Neurons  virtual reality system. [3]  She used the avatar Prana, while using the VR system. [4] 
 While on the Crystal Cloud Network, she heard that the  Dragon Knight Airborne Brigade  had a reputation, so she sought them out and challenged them to a Duel. The guild laughed at the idea of a single person facing the entire guild. However she Summoned her " Duza the Meteor Cubic Vessel ", which due to her high brainwave frequency had an  ATK  of 8800 Pulse, allowing it to easily destroy the Dragon Knight Airborne Brigade's " Cosmic Mineral Dragon Stone Head Dragon ". She then remarked that the guild were not as much as they had been hyped to be, before flying away. [3] 
 Seto Kaiba , who had watched her face the guild, commented that she must have a brainwave frequency that transcends that of a normal person and that she could be dangerous. While he found this captivating, from a business perspective, he could not let it go unchecked, so he took note of her name. Sera removed her Neurons gear afterwards, catching the attention of Kaiba, who was standing on a bridge above the testers. [3] 
 
       Sera approaches Kaiba, at his house.     
 A few weeks later, Sera approached Kaiba in his laboratory, at his house. After overhearing him mention that he would rule his Duel Links world, as King, she commented that he could never become King. Kaiba recognized her from the test session and was impressed that she was able to get inside. [4] 
 Sera claimed to be the test subject whose duty it is to shape his new world. She thanked Kaiba for the creation of Duel Links. She discussed the prospect of an individual with superior consciousness being in the system and the Duel Links potential to grant access to other dimensions, beyond the realm of the living, something she knew Kaiba was interested in. She suddenly disappeared as she talked about Kaiba syncing with this superior consciousness. [4] 
 When an unfamiliar consciousness emerged in the Duel Links world, with all test subjects' neuro signals being drawn to it, Sera through her avatar Prana, located Kaiba in the Duel Links world. She flew her ship next to Kaiba's jet and warned him of the danger he was approaching. She asked if he was prepared to face a world of evil, transcending the boundaries of mortal man. She offered to let him proceed if he could defeat her in a Duel, but that he would die if he lost. [4] 
 
         Sera's "Prana" avatar is defeated.     
 Kaiba accepted the Duel. His " Blue-Eyes White Dragon ", with 3000 Pulse  ATK , at first seemed no match for her 8800 Pulse ATK "Duza the Meteor Cubic Vessel". Kaiba controlled his thought frequency, bringing its Pulse to 19900, destroying "Duza" and defeating Prana. [4] 
 Having lost the Duel, Sera's "Prana" avatar disappeared, leaving her in her regular appearance. She was slightly annoyed, as she had liked the style of that avatar. Having made her attempt to stop Kaiba, Sera said that there was now no turning back and accompanied him as they approached an apparition of  Atem . However they were logged out when  Mokuba Kaiba  performed an emergency shutdown on the Duel Links, as Kaiba's amplified brain activity put his life in danger. [4] 
 Sera was later approached by  Tomo , who asked her what book she was reading. Before she could answer, they were both distracted as Tomo accidentally let his balloon float away. After she resumed reading her book, she was approached by  Aigami , who commented that Sera had gotten very close. Aigami returned the balloon to Tomo and said to Sera that Kaiba was not somebody they could easily eliminate. [4] 
 
 The Dark Side of Dimensions 
 Sera was in Egypt alongside her brother  Aigami  and their companion,  Mani . She watched from afar as Yugi and his friends reminisce on all that had happened since they first met. She recalled how she and Aigami were orphans in Egypt many years ago, and how they had met Mani. After Aigami's Duel with Kaiba, Aigami managed to get two pieces of the  Millennium Puzzle , which Kaiba was trying to reassemble, and gave a piece to Sera. [2] 
 She then went to the  Kame Game  shop, where she showed  Yugi  the  Prana Realm . She disappeared, giving Yugi her piece of the Millennium Puzzle. [2] 
 When Yugi was about to get hit by a car, Sera saved him, and teleported him to safety. She told Yugi that it was his choice whether he should complete the Millennium Puzzle, and requested Yugi to save her brother. Sera later appeared before Aigami and apologized, but still maintained that she made the right decision by giving Yugi a piece of the Puzzle. [2] 
 Sera and the other Prana children observed the Duel between Yugi and Kaiba over the pieces of the Millennium Puzzle. When Yugi completed the Puzzle, she was surprised to see that the Pharaoh had not returned. [2] 
 Dark Diva  interrupted the Duel and Sera appeared before him. She lamented her brother’s corruption and his new intent to turn the Prana’s paradise into a dimension of darkness that would consume reality, identifying the  Quantum Cube  as the eighth Millennium Item. Dark Diva proceeded to banish Sera and the other Prana children before Dueling Yugi and Kaiba. They were restored after Atem returned from the afterlife to help Yugi defeat Dark Diva, however, his resurrection caused them to lose access to the Prana. After Aigami was freed from the influence of the  Millennium Ring , she and Aigami parted ways with Mani, on good terms. [2]
