 Summary 
   This summary is currently incomplete. 
 Twenty years in the future, agreeing to help his father  Leo  in his research,  Reiji  is diligently analyzing the energy data on  Genesis Omega Dragon  for hours until he felt a tremor. Reiji attempts to investigate, only to find the door locked as a video feed of Leo appears and tells his son that the world is being destroyed by G.O.D., showing footage of meteors hitting the city, and that he purposely trapped his son to spare him from the unfolding apocalypse. Leo explains that the card containing G.O.D was stolen by his friend  Yusho Sakaki  and gives Reiji the task to track down Yusho's  son  through time and stop him from learning how to control the Duel Monster.
 In the present, Reiji having explained what his father told him, Yuya tries to explain himself and his father's actions. But Reiji refuses to listen as he uses the effect of his " D/D Scale Surveyor " to render Yuya unable to  Pendulum Summon . This forces Yuya to call his counterparts for help,  Yuto  tagging in while commenting on Yuya's earlier remark for him and  Yuri  to let him handle Reiji by himself. Yuto plays the Spell card  Pendulum XYZ  so he use the Odd-Eye Dragons in Yuya’s Pendulum zone to  Xyz Summon  " Dark Anthelion Dragon ". When Reiji manages to use " D/D/D Supersight King Zero Maxwell 's" ability to negate battle damage and Pendulum Summon it back on the field, an eager Yuri takes over and uses " Dowsing Fusion " to use the "Odd-Eyes" Dragons in Yuya's Graveyard to  Fusion Summon  " Starving Venemy Dragon ". Reiji only smirks at seeing Yuto and Yuri's dragons, commenting that the duel has now become more entertaining.
 
 Featured Duel: Yuya Sakaki/Yuto/Yuri vs. Reiji Akaba 
 Duel continues from the previous Scale . 
 Turn 2: Reiji 
 Reiji   Sets  1 card.
 Turn 3: Yuya 
 Yuya  attempts to use his set  Pendulum Scales  to  Pendulum Summon  his  monsters  back from his  Extra Deck , however, Reiji  activates  the  Pendulum Effect  of " D/D Scale Surveyor ", setting both of Yuya's Pendulum Scales to zero (" Odd-Eyes Persona Dragon ": Scale 1 → 0) (" Odd-Eyes Phantom Dragon ": Scale 4 → 0).
 At this point,  Yuto  switches places with Yuya.
 Yuto activates " Pendulum XYZ ", allowing him to treat the  Level  of "Persona Dragon" as the same Level as "Phantom Dragon" and use both cards from his  Pendulum Zones  as  Xyz Materials . He overlays the Level 7 "Persona Dragon" and "Phantom Dragon" to  Xyz Summon  " Dark Anthelion Dragon " (3000/2500). Yuto activates the effect of "Anthelion Dragon": by  detaching  1 Xyz Material, "Anthelion Dragon" halves the  ATK  of " D/D/D Supersight King Zero Maxwell " ("Maxwell": 2800 → 1400 ATK), increases its own ATK by the same amount ("Anthelion": 3000 → 4400 ATK) and recovers Yuto's  LP  by that same amount (Yuto: 1200 → 2600 LP). "Anthelion Dragon"  attacks  and  destroys  "Zero Maxwell", but the latter's effect reduces the  battle damage  to Reiji's LP to zero.
 As his  turn  ends, Yuto switches back to Yuya.
 Turn 4: Reiji 
Reiji uses his set Pendulum Scales to Pendulum Summon "Zero Maxwell" (2800/2500) from his Extra Deck. He activates " Block Attack ", switching "Anthelion Dragon" to  Defense Position . "Zero Maxwell" attacks "Anthelion Dragon", with its effect activating, reducing the latter's  DEF  to zero. Yuya activates the effect of "Anthelion Dragon", detaching its last Xyz Material to halve the ATK of "Zero Maxwell" ("Maxwell": 2800 → 1400 ATK), increase its own ATK by the same amount ("Anthelion": 3000 → 4400 ATK) and recover Yuya's LP by that same amount (Yuya: 2600 → 4000 LP). Furthermore, "Anthelion Dragon" prevents its own destruction the turn Yuya has activated its effect, so it isn't destroyed by the attack, but the effect of "Zero Maxwell" still inflicts  piercing  battle damage to Yuya (Yuya: 4000 → 2600 LP). Reiji activates his  face-down  " 00 Rush ", allowing "Zero Maxwell" to attack "Anthelion Dragon" again; once more, "Anthelion Dragon" isn't destroyed, but Yuya takes piercing battle damage (Yuya: 2600 → 1200 LP). Reiji Sets 1 card. During the  End Phase , the effect of "Anthelion Dragon" wears off, returning its own ATK, as well as the ATK of "Zero Maxwell" to their original values.
 Turn 5: Yuya 
Since Yuya currently has 3  Pendulum Monsters  in his Extra Deck, he activates " Pendulum Halt ",  drawing  2 cards.
 At this point,  Yuri  switches places with Yuya.
 Yuri activates " Dowsing Fusion ", allowing him to use Pendulum Monsters from his  Graveyard  as  Fusion Materials . Yuri fuses "Persona Dragon" and "Phantom Dragon" to  Fusion Summon  " Starving Venemy Dragon " (2500/2000).
 Duel continues in the next Scale .

 Trivia 
 This chapter's Japanese name holds a double meaning. While the Furigana forces the reading "Pendulum(s)", the base Kanji reads "(The) Two Destined Ones/(The) Destined Two" (運命の二人  Unmei no futari ), making the base form read something along the lines of "The Destined Two Swing!", while the Furigana makes one read it as "The Pendulum(s) Swing!/Swinging Pendulum(s)!".
