      Yugi  at one of Sozoji's All Night Solo Live Shows.     
 Sozoji's All Night Solo Live Show  was a monthly karaoke concert in the  Yu-Gi-Oh!  manga , performed by the terrible singer  Sozoji . [1] 
 Sozoji forced  Yugi Mutou  and  Tomoya Hanasaki  to sell tickets to his concert at ¥2000 (about $17 US at the time) each. Neither of them were able to sell any tickets, but Yugi offered to take Hanasaki's tickets to sell, so only one of them would suffer when they're not sold. However Sozoji saw the transaction and beat-up Hanasaki afterwards. [1] 
 When nobody else showed-up for the concert, Sozoji forced Yugi to listen to his singing on earphones turned-up to a deafening volume. After the first song, he showed Yugi, Hanasaki's beaten body. Enraged,  Dark Yugi  emerged and faced Sozoji in a  silence game   Shadow Game , using  Sound Pierrot  dolls. Sozoji lost and received the "Beat Festival"  Penalty Game . [1]
