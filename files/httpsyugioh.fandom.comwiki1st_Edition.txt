 1st Edition  is an  edition  of cards in the  TCG , Korean  OCG , and Asian-English  OCG  that is marked by the text "1st Edition". It is not used in the Japanese, Japanese-Asian, and Chinese  OCG .
 Every  Booster Pack  is initially printed as 1st Edition for a limited period, after which they are replaced by  Unlimited Edition  prints.  Structure Decks  and  Starter Decks  are typically printed as 1st Edition, with Unlimited Edition reprints often occurring years later in bundles with  errata .
 On 1st Edition and Limited Edition cards, the  Eye of Anubis Hologram  is gold; on Unlimited Edition cards, it is silver. 1st Edition cards also seem to have a darker print coloring than their Unlimited Edition cards.
 For  Series 3  to  8  cards, the edition text (such as the text "1st Edition") is located under the left side of the card's artwork. From  Series 9  onward, for cards without  limitation text , the edition text is located to the right of the  passcode  (leaving a space for the passcode even if the card has none); for cards with limitation text other than  Pendulum Monsters , the edition text is located in its previous position (Pendulum Monsters with limitation text do not have edition text).
 On the secondary market, 1st Edition prints of cards are typically worth more than their equivalent  Unlimited Edition  print of the same rarity.
