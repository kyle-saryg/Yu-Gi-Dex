      The duralumin case, filled with cards     
 The  duralumin case  (ジュラルミン ケース  jurarumin kēsu ) is an accessory of  Seto Kaiba , in the  Yu-Gi-Oh!  manga . He uses it to carry important  Duel Monsters  cards and has on occasion taken advantage of its robustness, to utilize it as a weapon.
 
 History 
 Kaiba attempted to purchase the " Blue-Eyes White Dragon "  Duel Monsters  card from  Sugoroku Mutou , at  Kame Game . He opened the case on the counter, revealing it to be full of cards and offered to trade all of them for the "Blue-Eyes". Sugoroku refused due to its sentimental value and advised Kaiba to similarly treasure each card in the case, in order to learn the true strength of the game. When Kaiba was later accused by  Yugi Mutou  of stealing the "Blue-Eyes White Dragon", he feigned innocence, but became frustrated with Yugi's persistence and struck him in the face with the case. [1] 
 
       Kaiba uses the case to hold  Croquet  hostage.     
 After waking from his coma and learning  Mokuba Kaiba  had been kidnapped, Kaiba collected his duralumin case, [2]  using it to store cards and his  Duel Disk prototypes , [3]  before travelling to confront  Maximillion J. Pegasus . [2]  On  Pegasus' island , he struck  Croquet  with the case, after being denied permission to see Pegasus. He held Croquet at gunpoint and instructed him to take the case to the guest room. The case was emptied and Croquet put his head inside, while Kaiba rested his foot over the case. He threatened to slam it shut and snap Croquet's neck, if he was kept waiting any longer. Having removed his important cards, Kaiba made it clear that he had no reservations in getting blood on the case, which would wash off easily. [4] 
 The duralumin case remained in Pegasus' holding, after he captured Kaiba's soul. Croquet later gave it to Yugi to return to Kaiba. [5] 
 Kaiba brought the case with him, when he met  Ishizu Ishtar  and dropped it to the floor, in surprise, when Ishizu gave him the  God  card, " The God of the Obelisk ". [6] 
 During the  Battle City  tournament, Kaiba challenged  Koji Nagumo  to  a Duel , after seeing him involved in an  ante  dispute. He tore up Koji's would-be ante, " Hyozanryu ", saying he would have lost in their Duel anyway. To compensate, he wagered all the cards in the duralumin case and allowed Koji to borrow cards from the case to strengthen his Deck before the Duel. [7]
