 This card can be  searched  by " Dark Sage ", " Ancient Gear Drill ", " Alchemic Magician ", " Angmarl the Fiendish Monarch ", " Left Arm Offering ", " Watch Dog " and " The Despair Uranus ". 
 Optional three-tribute monsters such as " Gilford the Lightning ", " Moisture Creature ", " Beast King Barbaros ", etc. can be used with this card. 
 Note that the second and third effects do not require the monsters to be Tributed for the same  Tribute Summon . If you can Tribute Summon multiple times during a turn, such as via " Proof of Pruflas " or " Angel O1 ", you can Tribute a monster that was Tribute Summoned that same turn, for a Tribute Summon, and still gain at least the second effect. 
 Use " Free-Range Monsters " or " Escalation of the Monarchs " after your opponent Sets a card during their  Main Phase 2 , to Tribute Summon a monster and allow this card to destroy the card your opponent just Set.
