 In products 
 Cards with higher rarities are generally sought after, traded at higher prices, and generally treated in better conditions.
 
 Pre-constructed Decks 
 See also:  Fixed Rarity 
 Main articles:  Starter Deck  and  Structure Decks 
 Contents of copies of the same Pre-constructed decks are generally identical (Except for some added contents the set may offer), so copies cards will be released in the same rarity. In this case, rarity only serves for visual effect purpose, and has no impact on its elusiveness.
 Generally, preconstucted decks offer the core cards in  Ultra Rare  and  Super Rare . Other Special Sets may offer higher rarities, such as Secret Rare.
 
 Booster Sets 
 Main article:  Booster Pack 
 For rarity name, see  Rare .      
   This section is currently incomplete. 
 While not truly random, cards in Booster packs are generally gained in a non-predetermined manner (i.e. People cannot know if a pack will contain cards with high rarity, such as  Super Rare , or just a " Rare ". Unless they  scale  or use other underhanded technique). Since it is unlikely to gain cards with high rarity in a consistent manner, they are often traded at higher prices.
 The same can be applied to  Booster SP ,  Duelist Packs ,  Premium Packs , and any products that offer card contents in a hidden manner.
 
 Visual Effects 
 The following table gives a rundown of each rarities' main features/effects. More detailed descriptions and example images can be found on their individual articles.

 Notes 
 A  Test Print  is a test card used for checking alignment of the printing and cutting machines. 
 Fixed Rarity  ( FR ) refers to cards whose printed rarity does not match how rare they actually are, and is seen most often with Super and Ultra Rare cards in  Starter  and  Structure  Decks. 
 Sets which are  Out of Print  are no longer being produced.
