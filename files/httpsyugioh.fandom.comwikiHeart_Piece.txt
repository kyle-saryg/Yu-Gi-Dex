A  Heart Piece  (ハートピース  Hātopīsu ) is the proof of participation for the  World Duel Carnival . Each  Duelist  receives one Heart Piece and a heart-shaped framework to hold them. 
 In order to complete a full heart and advance in the finals, the Duelist has to collect four more pieces. However, if all pieces are lost, the participant will be automatically disqualified. [1]  The number of Heart Pieces can be viewed on the player's  Life Points , abbreviated as "HP". [2]  Not every piece fits into the frame, as  Yuma Tsukumo 's piece won from  Cody Callus  didn't fit. [3]  A full container is needed to start the  Duel Coaster . [4] 
 Multiple types of Heart Pieces exist and the different types have to be collected to form the perfect heart. [3]  Duelists decide how many pieces they bet in a Duel themselves. [5]  The concept of Heart Pieces is similar to the concept of  Star Chips  and  Locator Cards  used in the  Duelist Kingdom  and  Battle City  arcs of the  Yu-Gi-Oh!  second series anime .
 
 Initial heart. Complete heart.
