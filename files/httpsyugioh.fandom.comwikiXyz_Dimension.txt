      The Four Dimensions. (Click on one of the dimensions to go to its page.)     
 The  Xyz Dimension  (エクシーズ 次 元   Ekushīzu Jigen ) is one of the  Four Dimensions  in the  Yu-Gi-Oh! ARC-V  anime, where all the  Duelists  use  Xyz Monsters . [1]   Heartland City  was  attacked  by an army of Duelists from the  Fusion Dimension 's  Duel Academy [1] , resulting in large amounts of its inhabitants being  turned into cards . The survivors organized themselves into a  resistance , counterattacking using the same method. [2]  In the English dub, the residents of this dimension are sometimes referred to as "Xyzians". Alternate versions of  Kite Tenjo ,  Spencer , and  Devon Knox  exist in this dimension. A Fusion Dimension base also exists in this dimension.
 This dimension is known for using  Rank-Up-Magic  cards to  Rank-Up  their Xyz Monsters. This is only exclusive to the Xyz Dimension as the  Standard Dimension  was unaware of it until  Shay  used his. [2]
