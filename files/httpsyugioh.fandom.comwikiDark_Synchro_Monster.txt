 Dark Synchro Monsters  (Japanese: ダークシンクロモンスター  Dāku Shinkuro Monsutā ) are a type of  Monster Card  exclusive to the anime, manga, and  Tag Force  video games. They are a counterpart to  Synchro Monsters , having  Negative Levels  (in the anime and video games) that are represented by blue orbs with purple stars, or are Level 0 (in the manga). The color of their card frame is dark grey. These cards are placed in the  Extra Deck .
 Dark Synchro Monsters are  Dark Synchro Summoned  by  sending  1  Dark Tuner monster  and 1 non- Tuner monster  to the  Graveyard . The non- Tuner monster 's  Level  minus the  Dark Tuner monster 's  Level  must be equal to the Dark Synchro Monster's  Level .
 In the anime, their negative Level stars are left-aligned (like the  Ranks  of an  Xyz Monster ), contrasting to the right-aligned positive Levels, while their dark gray card frame contrasts with the white card frame of regular Synchro Monsters.
 Dark Synchro Monsters debuted in  episode 27  of  Yu-Gi-Oh! 5D's . They are also present in the  Yu-Gi-Oh! 5D's  manga and the video games  Yu-Gi-Oh! 5D's Tag Force 4 ,  5 , and  6 .
 Because of the greater difficulty in Summoning them, Dark Synchro Monsters are generally more powerful than Synchro Monsters of their equivalent Level.
 
 In the  OCG / TCG 
 There are no Dark Synchro Monsters in the  OCG / TCG . In the  OCG / TCG , all Dark Synchro Monsters have been released as regular  Synchro Monsters  with Positive Levels not Negatives.
 Dark Synchro Monsters from the anime (except " Moon Dragon Quilla ") require  DARK - Attribute   Tuner monsters  (instead of  Dark Tuner monsters ) to be Synchro Summoned. Also, the non- Tuner monsters  are required to be the same Type as the non-Tuner monster that was used for their  Dark Synchro Summon  in anime (e.g. in the anime,  Grady  Dark Synchro Summoned " Frozen Fitzgerald " using " Dark Tuner Catastrogue " and the  Beast - Type  non-Tuner " Blizzard Lizard "; as such, the  TCG / OCG  card " Frozen Fitzgerald " requires Beast-Type non-Tuner monsters).
 The two Dark Synchro Monsters from the manga, " Ultimaya Tzolkin " and " Phantasmal Lord Ultimitl Bishbaalkin ", are  Level  0 and have Summoning conditions that more closely simulate the Summon of Dark Synchro Monsters. They require  sending  1 Tuner and 1 non-Tuner with the same Level from the player's  field  to the  Graveyard .
