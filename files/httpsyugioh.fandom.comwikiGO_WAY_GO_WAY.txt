 Isn't this world a tad boring? 
Or perhaps hadn't I gave it my all yet? 
(Do you understand?)

I pretty much have all the answers already 
 Once I start up I won't quit 
That's what I think even when I'm losing 
(Do you understand?) 
I understand! 
I pretty much have the formula for my turnaround 
 Are ya worried about it not coming true? 
I'll try it out myself, yo 
I don't give a damn if people say it's boring 
Quitting at this point would be but a huge failure! 
Come on! ga,ga,ga,guys&dolls

A door will always be open for you 
 Test your own strength, GO WAY GO WAY!

As long as you have strength, WAY GO WAY!

I've already gathered all the courage I need 
Of course you understand!
