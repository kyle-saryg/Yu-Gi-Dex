 " Phantasm " ( 幻 魔   Genma ) is an  archetype  of  DARK   Fiend  monsters that are associated with the  Sacred Beasts .
 They are only supported by one card, " Dimension Fusion Destruction ", which, as a  Fusion Summoning  card, currently works with only three of the members: " Armityle the Chaos Phantasm " ( Phantom of Fury ) and " Phantasm Emperor Trilojig ". "Armityle" is used by  Yubel  in the  Yu-Gi-Oh! GX  anime and is the merger of all three Sacred Beasts, while "Trilojig" is used by  Eve  in the  Yu-Gi-Oh! ARC-V  manga and was modeled after the Sacred Beasts.
 A number of older cards, such as " Phantasmal Lord Ultimitl Bishbaalkin ", " Harpie's Pet Phantasmal Dragon‎ ", and the entire " Phantasm Spiral " archetype, include "Phantasm" in their English names but are not part of this archetype, as their Japanese names do not contain  幻 魔 . However, because  TCG  and  OCG  support for this archetype only works on Fusion Monsters, neither have been an issue.
