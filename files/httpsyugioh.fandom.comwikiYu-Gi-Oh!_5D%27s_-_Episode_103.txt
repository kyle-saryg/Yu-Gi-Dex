 " Party Crashers ", known as " The Spoils of Battle " in the Japanese version, is the one-hundred-and-third episode of the  Yu-Gi-Oh! 5D's  anime. It first aired in Japan on March 31, 2010 and in the United States on April 30, 2011.
 Starting this episode, the English dub switches from using the term "Machine Emperor" to " Meklord " akin to the cards' rename in the English  Yu-Gi-Oh! Trading Card Game .
 Yusei  wins a white-hot Duel with  Jean , allowing  Team 5D's  to advance past the first round of the  WRGP  preliminaries. Yusei and the rest of his team, have a victory celebration at their garage.

 Summary 
 In a white hot battle,  Yusei  finally beats Jean, meaning  Team 5D's  makes it past the first round of the WRGP Preliminaries. Yusei and the others, after swearing their combined efforts with Jean and the rest of his team, have a victory celebration at their garage. During the party, Sherry appears, asking what the real purpose of the WRGP is. Team 5D's and Sherry discuss events so far, especially the ones involving the  Infinity  monsters, and the duels where the damage becomes real, especially with the absence of the  Dark Signers . Trying to link the events together, the name of Yliaster comes to mind. 
 Meanwhile, Bruno, beginning to be unable to cope with his lack of identity and thinking of the odd occurrences in the past, tries to come to grips with them, taking time away from Team 5D's by returning to the beach where he was found. 
 Team 5D's, save for Bruno, return to the WRGP stadium, only to see that both  Andre  and  Jean  have crashed, with  Breo  beside them in a state of shock. Their opponents,  Team Catastrophe , win because of damages to   Team Unicorn . The members Team Catastrophe mutely stand victorious with grins on their faces, as if nothing has gone wrong.
 
 Differences in adaptations 
 At the victory banquet, Jack's drink is recolored in the dub, making it look more like water; that was possibly to avoid references to alcoholic beverages. 
 Errors 
 In the English dub, as  Sherry Leblanc  explains the events in the basement of the Sector Security building, right as the card starts to glow, the original Japanese card for " Z-ONE " can be seen for a split second. The scene only a second prior to Yusei running at  Bruno  and Sherry has the correct card design for the dub, however.
