 " Tour Guide From the Underworld " sets up a 1-card summon of this card, though it would have to target itself for destruction to use either effect. 
 This card's ideal destruction target is " Abyss Actor - Wild Hope ". Search " Abyss Actor - Mellow Madonna " via either "Wild Hope" or this card, in order to search another " Abyss Actor " monster and set up the  Pendulum Scales . The other searched "Abyss Actor" monster can then be  Pendulum Summoned  from the hand alongside "Wild Hope".
 If you  Link Summoned  this card using "Tour Guide From the Underworld" and the " Abyss Actor - Comic Relief " that it summoned, you can potentially Pendulum Summon three monsters after using this card's effect.
