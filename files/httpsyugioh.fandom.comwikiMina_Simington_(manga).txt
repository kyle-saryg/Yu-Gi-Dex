 In the  Sector Security building , Mina reported to Rex that " he " had arrived in  Satellite  which pleased Rex. He then asked her to begin the preparations for the  D1 Grand Prix  which she agreed to. [1]

 Mina later observed  Yusei Fudo 's  Duel  against  Greiger  along with Jack, Rex and  Lazar  in the D1 Grand Prix observation tower [2] . When Greiger revealed he was going to perform a  One Turn Kill  on Yusei, Mina informed the others of Greiger's record, noting his nickname as "The Undefeated Giant" but she was quickly corrected when Jack reminded her of his victory over Greiger. Mina quickly apologized, with Lazar insulting her clumsiness. [3]  Mina covered her ears when the sound of Yusei's  Cross Sense  destroyed Greiger's  Duel Runner  and damaged the stadium track. [4]  When Rex and Lazar were discussing the psychic abilities of  Akiza Izinski  and  Sherry LeBlanc , Mina questioned them on what they meant, but was ignored. [5] 
 Mina also watched  Crow Hogan 's Duel with  Bolt Tanner  and was surprised when Jack enjoyed the Duel. [6]  During Yusei's Duel with  Hunter Pace , Mina questioned the whereabouts of Lazar. [7]  When Jack sensed the use of a " Duel Dragon ", Mina questioned where he was going, but he ignored her and rode off on his Duel Runner. [8]
