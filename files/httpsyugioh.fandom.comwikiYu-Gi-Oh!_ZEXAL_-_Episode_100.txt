 Summary 
       Nash  and  Shark  notice the wall opening up.     
 Yuma 's Duel with  Mach  continues, with the lives of  Shark  and  Dumon , who claimed he was Nash, on the line.  Rio  mutters Shark's name (cut from the dub). Yuma commands " Gagaga Magician " to attack Mach's  Set  monster. Its chains transform into lightning bolts that strike the other monster, " Secret Sect Druid Wid ", destroying it. As the monster is destroyed, Dumon and Shark notice one of the other walls opening up a path. They manage to escape in time as Mach says that a hero once said this: "Deep bonds with each other open up paths for each other" ("The wise Duelist who understands the bond between friends can open up new paths" in the dub). Rio is happy that her brother managed to save himself from being crushed. Mach activates the effect of "Wid", allowing him to  activate  a  Continuous Spell Card  from his hand, as "Wid" was destroyed by battle. He activates " Labyrinth of Decisions ". He then sends two cards from his hand to the  Graveyard  to activate his  face-down  " Unfair Treaty ".  Astral  thinks that Mach may be planning something with these cards. Outside the Duel, the ceiling starts to come down on Shark and Dumon. Dumon thinks that if he had his powers, he would be able to escape, but he can't, as his  Baria Crystal  is damaged. Back at the Duel, Yuma tells Shark to hold on and orders " Gagaga Child " to attack Mach  directly  (in the dub, Yuma does not refer to "Child" by name). "Child" eats another popsicle and blows an icy gust of wind at Mach, reducing his  Life Points  to 2700. Another doorway opens for Shark and Dumon. Mach declares that he will activate his two-card combo. As Shark and Dumon escape once again, Mach activates the effect of "Labyrinth of Decisions" (in the dub, Mach adds that with every move Yuma makes, he'll seal the doom of his friends); after an opponent's monster battles, he can  pay  600 Life Points to have Yuma send a card from his hand to the Graveyard. Yuma repeats the statement in surprise and Mach continues with the effect of "Unfair Treaty"; whenever Mach would pay Life Points for the effect of a Continuous Spell Card, Yuma must pay the cost instead. Astral finally understands Mach's strategy, as Mach urges Yuma to pay the Life Points and discard the card. Yuma complies and discards " Gogogo Golem ". An explosion knocks Yuma back, reducing his Life Points to 3400. Astral says that Mach's strategy is to destroy Yuma's hand and Life Points. Yuma asks what kind of test this is. Astral thinks about Mach's riddle, "Deep bonds with each other open up paths for each other", and declares that he finally understands it (in the dub, Astral does not mention the riddle and instead says that he and Yuma are put in a dire situation). When Yuma attacked with his monsters, new paths opened up for Dumon and Shark. Yuma asks what he means. Astral elaborates that with this strategy, Mach can chip away at their Life Points if they attack, and if they don't, they will be unable to save Shark and Dumon. Yuma agrees. Mach asks Yuma on what he will do to survive this test (in the dub, Mach says that Astral is correct, and presents Yuma with two choices: save his Life Points, or save his friends). Yuma tells Mach to quit joking (in the dub, he asks if this is a Duel or a multiple choice test) and  overlays  his two Level 4 monsters to  Xyz Summon  " Number 39: Utopia ". He ends his turn.
 
       " Number 44: Sky Pegasus " appears.     
 Mach asks if this is Yuma's " Number " and begins his turn (in the dub, Mach says that Yuma's "Number" is impressive, but looks can be deceiving). He Normal Summons " Secret Sect Druid Dru ", which appears in a cloud of smoke. He activates its effect, allowing him to  Special Summon  a " Druid " monster from his Graveyard; he Special Summons "Wid". Mach declares that he will finally reveal his "Number" and overlays his two Level 4 monsters to Xyz Summon " Number 44: Sky Pegasus ". Astral says that the "Number" finally appeared. Mach says that the "Number" will impose a new trial on Yuma (in the dub, Astral mutters that "Sky Pegasus" must be the "Number" they are searching for. Mach replies that their search will be in vain unless they pass his test). He activates the effect of "Sky Pegasus", detaching an  Overlay Unit  to destroy an opponent's monster; he targets "Utopia" for his monster's effect. Yuma exclaims, "What?!" and Mach continues that Yuma can negate the effect by paying 500 Life Points. Astral tells Yuma that if they lose "Utopia", they can't save Shark and Dumon. Yuma says that he knows and decides to pay 500 Life Points to negate the destruction. Mach activates the other effect of "Sky Pegasus"; as Yuma paid Life Points, he takes damage equal to the Life Points he paid. The wings of "Sky Pegasus" glow blue and it flies up. It charges towards Yuma, surrounded by yellow energy before ramming him, knocking him back and reducing his Life Points to 2400.  Tori  yells Yuma's and Astral's names. Yuma manages to land on his feet. He comments that if this keeps up, his Life Points will be drained away. Astral adds that "Sky Pegasus" is part of Mach's combo as well (Astral's observation is cut from the dub).
 
       Rio  tells Shark the Duel just started.     
Meanwhile, Shark and Dumon are resting in another room. Shark asks what exactly is going on here, with one trap coming after the other (in the dub, Shark says that whoever designed the maze had some maze-craze). An orb floats down in front of the boys. They run up to it, and Yuma appears on it, engaged in a Duel. This surprises Shark. Rio tells Shark that the Duel just started. Shark says, "What?" Tori continues that a  Number Guardian  appeared in front of them. Shark repeats the statement, confused (in the dub, Rio says that Yuma is trying to save Shark. Her brother asks how Yuma would do that. Tori replies that Yuma has to beat Mach, the knight who trapped Shark. Shark asks what happens if Yuma lost, while also commenting on Mach's "goofy-looking armor"). Astral informs Shark that the traps set for them are linked to the Duel; when they attacked, a new door opened up. He also tells Shark about Mach's Duel strategy of destroying Yuma's Life Points and hand whenever he attacked. Shark curses, muttering that Mach had him and Dumon locked down completely. Yuma tells Shark to hold on because he will save him (Astral does not tell Shark about Mach's strategy in the dub; Yuma telling Shark to hold on is also cut). Mach interrupts him and tells Yuma that once friends are separated, their inner value may come into question (in the dub, Mach says that even when separated, true friends can help each other). Astral repeats the statement in his thoughts. He ponders for a moment, before coming to a conclusion. He asks Shark if he can find any hints on how to win the Duel.          The mural.     
 Shark repeats the statement and looks around before finding some carvings on a wall. Astral says that this is it, surprising his friends. He continues that Mach's trial is some sort of mystery game. If separating the group was the start of the trial, then Shark's present location may contain hints to solve the mystery. Rio asks Shark about what he saw on the wall. He replies that he can see pictures and some form of text, but he can't read it. Dumon says he can read it, saying that it is a legend about an ancient hero. Shark is surprised that Dumon can understand the script. Dumon continues with the story: long ago, there was a group of knights who defended their land. One of them rode on his beloved steed, a Pegasus. The knights, led by that hero, protected the peace of their country. One day, the hero left the country to return to his hometown. While the hero was gone, the other knights overthrew the king and took over the country. Without the hero, the knights were conceited due to their newfound power and began to call themselves kings. Shark asks who exactly Dumon is, suspicious (in the dub, Shark calls the story a fairy tale). 
 
         " Utopia " attacks "Sky Pegasus".     
Back at the Duel, Astral asks what the legend is trying to tell them. Dumon says that the rest of the legend isn't there. Suddenly, the ceiling above him and Shark starts to crumble. The boys manage to dodge the debris falling on them. Rio yells Shark's name and tells Yuma to hurry up and continue the Duel. Yuma agrees and starts his turn. Astral urges Yuma to attack in order to save Shark and Dumon even if it means reducing their Life Points further. Yuma agrees and declares an attack on "Sky Pegasus" with "Utopia". Mach counters with his face-down " Intrigue Shield ", equipping it to "Sky Pegasus"; once per turn, it cannot be  destroyed by battle  and Mach takes no damage from battles involving it. Another path opens up for Shark and Dumon as this happens. After damage calculation, Mach activates the effects of "Labyrinth of Decisions" and "Unfair Treaty", forcing Yuma to pay 600 Life Points and send a card from his hand to the Graveyard. Yuma sends " Cross Attack " to the Graveyard and his Life Points are reduced to 1800. The effect of "Sky Pegasus" then inflicts damage to Yuma equal to the Life Points he paid; Yuma's Life Points are further reduced to 1200. Tori yells Yuma's name. Yuma Sets a card and ends his turn. Astral asks Shark if the carvings continue to the other room. The latter confirms it.         The hero and his pegasus.      Dumon continues the story. After hearing about the knights' rebellion, the hero returned to the castle. He attempted to reason with his comrades that their hearts were filled with justice. The hero also tried to make them remember the bonds that fought together. But the other knights turned their swords against the hero. The hero, refusing to fight back and kill his comrades, was eventually struck down. Suddenly, his Pegasus stepped in and stood in front of the knights in an attempt to protect its master. It continued to fight the knights in its master's stead. Yuma asks what happened next. Dumon replies that the story stops there because the mural is too worn out to be legible. Yuma is shocked. Dumon thinks that it's as if he knew the legend. He questions if he had been to these ruins before. 
 Mach starts his next turn. He activates the effect of "Sky Pegasus", detaching an Overlay Unit to try to destroy "Utopia" again. He also reminds Yuma that he can pay 500 Life Points to negate the effect. Shark tells Yuma that if his Life Points decrease further, he can't win. He also tells Yuma to let "Utopia" be destroyed and not to worry about him and Dumon. Mach asks Yuma to make his decision. Yuma is frustrated, not knowing what to do. Dumon tells Yuma to pay the 500 Life Points to keep "Utopia" on the field. Shark asks what he means and why Dumon would do this (in the dub, Shark calls this tactic cowardly). He replies that he knows the rest of the legend, surprising Shark (in the dub, Dumon says that he just remembered the rest of the legend). The floor suddenly caves in around the boys. Dumon continues that it was impossible for the hero to abandon his Pegasus. He did remain behind with the Pegasus and eventually passed away. Dumon yells at Shark if he understands. The legend is telling them about one person's attitude of believing in protecting one's friends. He urges Yuma to protect "Utopia". Shark still disagrees with Dumon's decision and suspects that he must be a Barian. The floor below Shark caves in completely and he falls in, but Dumon manages to grab his hand just in time. Rio yells Shark's name. Shark and Dumon, still hanging on for dear life, glow with a magenta aura.
 
         "Nash" reveals himself as Dumon.     
 Dumon admits to Shark that he is indeed a Barian, as his Baria Crystal is repaired. He undergoes  Barian Battlemorph  into his true form. Shark recognizes Dumon and tells Yuma not to trust him because he is a  Barian . Yuma is shocked by the revelation (in the dub, Yuma replies that this may be, but Dumon may know something else about the legend). Shark warns Yuma not to make the same mistake again. He remembers  the time when "Ray Shadows" revealed himself as Vector . Yuma is frustrated at the memory (Yuma's memory of Vector is cut from the dub). Astral mutters Yuma's name and tells him to trust in himself. Mach asks Yuma if he will get over his trial as "Sky Pegasus" glows with a gold aura and releases a beam of gold light from itself (in the dub, Mach says that he has waited long enough and urges Yuma to choose now). In the end, Yuma decides to pay the 500 Life Point cost to prevent the destruction of "Utopia". This surprises Shark. Mach activates the other effect of "Sky Pegasus", inflicting 500 damage to Yuma. Astral, fading in and out, grimly notes that he and Yuma have 200 Life Points left. Suddenly, he realizes something.
 
         Shark knock Dumon's hand away.     
 Dumon manages to pull Shark up to safety, with the latter knocking away the former's hand. Shark is frustrated at Yuma for following what Dumon said. Yuma admits that there was no doubt in him and that he did not want to doubt anyone (in the dub, Yuma says that he has to follow his instinct and Shark has to trust him). Shark mutters Yuma's name. Yuma begins his turn. Astral tells him that Mach's strategy is broken and advises Yuma to attack. Not knowing what Astral was talking about, Yuma agrees and attacks "Sky Pegasus" with "Utopia". "Intrigue Shield" prevents the destruction of "Sky Pegasus". As this happens, Dumon guides Shark out of the crumbling room. Mach activates the effect of "Labyrinth of Decisions" and Yuma sends " Hyper Quick! " to the Graveyard. Rio says that Yuma will lose the Duel at this point. Tori tells her not to worry and that Yuma will not lose (Tori's reply is cut from the dub). Rio is surprised that nothing happened to Yuma; Yuma himself is surprised as well. Astral says that with Yuma's Life Points at 200 after protecting "Utopia" twice, he cannot pay the cost of "Labyrinth", forcing Mach to pay it instead. A Graveyard portal appears and it explodes, knocking Mach back and reducing his Life Points to 2100. Astral concludes that Yuma's decision was right (in the dub, Astral declares that he and Yuma have the upper hand now). Yuma continues his turn by activating the effect of "Hyper Quick!" When it is sent to the Graveyard, he can draw a card, and if it is a  Normal Spell Card , it is treated as a  Quick-Play Spell Card . Astral calls this a "destiny draw", and Yuma draws his card, yelling " kattobingu !" He draws " Rank-Up-Magic Numeron Force " and activates it,  Ranking-Up  "Utopia" and performing a Chaos Xyz Evolution to Special Summon "  Number C39: Utopia Ray Victory ". Yuma's friends are in awe. (it should be noted that the effect-negating effect of "Numeron Force" is not mentioned at this point) Yuma activates the effect of "Utopia Ray Victory", detaching an Overlay Unit to add the ATK of "Sky Pegasus" to its own, declaring " Victory Charge " as he does so. He attacks and destroys "Sky Pegasus" with "Utopia Ray Victory", declaring " Rising Sun Double Victory Slash ". Mach is knocked back, his Life Points reduced to 0. Yuma mutters that they won. The path to outside is opened for Shark and Dumon.
 
         The knight and pegasus' grave (this was cut from the dub).     
 After the Duel, Mach congratulates Yuma for overcoming the trial. Astral asks Mach if he was the Pegasus who served the hero in the legend (in the dub, he asks how the legend ended). Mach confirms it, as he glows with a turquoise aura. He adds that there is more to the story: the knights were touched by the willingness of the hero and the Pegasus to sacrifice their lives. They regretted their actions and their desire for power vanished. The knights buried the hero and the Pegasus with honor, kneeling before their grave. The hero and the Pegasus then ascended to heaven (the knight's and Pegasus' grave is cut from the dub). Mach advises Yuma and Astral to use their ability to trust others. After this, he vanishes, leaving behind his "Number" card for Yuma to take (in the dub, Mach says that after all that had happened in the legend, he was left with no master. Yuma's belief in his friends move Mach to place himself in Yuma's service). Shark asks Dumon why he helped them all this time and Dumon says he doesn't know. He clarifies that the legend of the ruin may have moved his heart to help Yuma. Yuma then thanks Dumon for explaining the legend to them and because of that, they were able to win the Duel. Dumon says that it was Yuma' heart that helped him win because he would have trusted without listening to it (in the dub, Dumon says that even if he had not helped Yuma, Yuma would have put his friends above his own interests). He continues that he decided to be nice this time and that they will be enemies again the next time they met before disappearing into a portal.
 
         The cloud formation of "Sky Pegasus" above the ruins.     
 Yuma mutters Dumon's name. Then he sees a gold coin nearby, identifying it as a  King's Coin . Tori asks exactly what it is and Yuma explains that whenever  his father  would go out to dangerous places, he'd leave a Coin behind. Tori deduces that Kazuma must have been to these ruins. Yuma theorizes that his father must have been watching them from somewhere all this time. Outside the temple, Yuma tells his friends that the Barians have taken advantage of his ability to trust people and that he can't do a thing when he doubts others. He has no choice but to trust other people as a result (in the dub, Yuma also mentions that Kazuma was like him). Astral thinks that it's up to Yuma on whether to trust people or not, even if he and Yuma have to take different ways with each other (in the dub, Astral thinks that Yuma has decided on his own path, but he is uncertain on how he'll trust him).
 
 Featured Duel: Yuma Tsukumo vs. Mach 
 Duel continues from  the previous episode .
 Turn 2: Yuma  
" Gagaga Magician "  attacks  and  destroys   Mach 's  Set   monster , " Secret Sect Druid Wid " ( 4/0/1800). As the latter monster was destroyed and  sent  to the  Graveyard , Mach activates the effect of "Secret Sect Druid Wid" to activate " Labyrinth of Decisions " (a  Continuous Spell Card ) from his  hand . Due to "Labyrinth of Decisions", Mach can  pay  600  LP  to send one card from Yuma's hand to the Graveyard after  damage calculation . Mach then activates his  face-down  " Unfair Treaty " by sending two cards in his hand to the Graveyard. Due to "Unfair Treaty", Yuma must pay the  cost  for any Continuous Spell Card effects that Mach  controls , if possible. 
 " Gagaga Child " attacks directly (Mach: 4000 → 2700 LP). Mach activates the effect of "Labyrinth of Decisions" (Yuma: 4000 → 3400 LP) and Yuma sends " Gogogo Golem " from his hand to the Graveyard. Yuma then  overlays  "Gagaga Magician" and "Gagaga Child" in order to  Xyz Summon  " Number 39: Utopia " ( 4/2500/2000, ORU: 2) in  Attack Position .
 Turn 3: Mach  
 Mach  draws. He then  Normal Summons  " Secret Sect Druid Dru " ( 4/1800/0) in Attack Position. As "Secret Sect Druid Dru" was Normal Summoned, Mach activates its effect to revive "Secret Sect Druid Wid" (a " Druid " monster) ( 4/0/1800) in Attack Position. Mach overlays "Secret Sect Druid Dru" and "Secret Sect Druid Wid" in order to Xyz Summon " Number 44: Sky Pegasus " ( 4/1800/1600, ORU: 2) in Attack Position. Mach activates the final effect of "Sky Pegasus" to  detach  an  Overlay Unit  ("Sky Pegasus": 2 → 1 ORU) and destroy "Utopia", but Yuma may pay 500 LP to  negate  this effect. Yuma does so (Yuma: 3400 → 2900 LP). The third effect of "Sky Pegasus" activates, inflicting  damage  to Yuma equal to the LP he paid (Yuma: 2900 → 2400 LP).
 Turn 4: Yuma  
Yuma draws. "Utopia" attacks "Sky Pegasus", but Mach activates his face-down " Intrigue Shield ",  equipping  it to "Sky Pegasus". Due to the effect of "Intrigue Shield", "Sky Pegasus" is not  destroyed by battle  once per  turn , and Mach takes no  Battle Damage  from that  battle . Mach activates the effect of "Labyrinth of Decisions" (Yuma: 2400 → 1800 LP) and Yuma sends " Cross Attack " from his hand to the Graveyard. The third effect of "Sky Pegasus" activates (Yuma: 1800 → 1200 LP). Yuma Sets a card.
 Turn 5: Mach  
Mach draws. He then activates the final effect of "Sky Pegasus" ("Sky Pegasus": 1 → 0 ORU) to destroy "Utopia", but Yuma pays 500 LP to negate the effect (Yuma: 1200 → 700 LP). The third effect of "Sky Pegasus" activates (Yuma: 700 → 200 LP).
 Turn 6: Yuma  
Yuma draws. "Utopia" attacks "Sky Pegasus", but the effect of "Intrigue Shield" prevents the destruction of "Sky Pegasus" by battle and reduces the Battle Damage Mach would take to 0. Mach activates the effect of "Labyrinth of Decisions" (Mach: 2700 → 2100 LP) and Yuma sends " Hyper Quick! " from his hand to the Graveyard. As "Hyper Quick!" was sent from the hand to the Graveyard, Yuma activates its effect to  draw a card . If it is a  Spell Card , he may activate it as if it were a  Quick-Play . Yuma reveals " Rank-Up-Magic Numeron Force ", which he then activates to  Rank-Up  "Utopia" via  Chaos Xyz Evolution  and Xyz Summon " Chaos Number 39: Utopia Ray Victory " ( 5/2800/2500, ORU: 3) in Attack Position. Due to the first effect of "Rank-Up-Magic Numeron Force", the effects of all face-up cards on the field are negated, except for "Rank-Up-Magic Numeron Force" and "Utopia Ray Victory". 
 "Utopia Ray Victory" attacks "Sky Pegasus" and Yuma activates the effect of "Utopia Ray Victory" to detach an Overlay Unit ("Utopia Ray Victory": 3 → 2 ORU) and increase its  ATK  by the ATK of "Sky Pegasus" ("Utopia Ray Victory": 2800 → 4600 ATK). "Utopia Ray Victory" then destroys "Sky Pegasus" (Mach: 2100 → 0 LP).
