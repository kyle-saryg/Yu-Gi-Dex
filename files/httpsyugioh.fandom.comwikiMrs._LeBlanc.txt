 Mrs. LeBlanc  is the mother of  Sherry LeBlanc  and wife of  Dr. LeBlanc . Both she and her husband were murdered by the mysterious organization of  Iliaster , to acquire the special " Z-ONE " card her husband had designed. Dr. LeBlanc had discovered what Iliaster had been up to using the  Infinity  device.  Clark Smith , from the  Momentum Express Development Organization , was then responsible for allowing she and her husband's murders. In the dubbed version they are instead kidnapped by Iliaster and sent to a currently unknown secret location, though it's implied that they were also killed in the dub.
