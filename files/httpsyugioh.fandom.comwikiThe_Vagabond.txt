 Description 
 The Vagabond is a Duelist,  steeped in legend and shrouded in mystery,  who makes rare appearances in the game. He will challenge you to Duels with  special conditions,  but depending on how the Duel plays out, you can obtain  more character experience points than normal. If you have the opportunity, be sure to challenge the Vagabond to a Duel!
 
 Features 
 The Vagabond will occasionally show up in Duel World. If approached, he will remain mute, but will offer to Duel the player with a pre-determined "challenge" imposed on that player. These opportunities are beneficial for the player, as they will receive more character experience points than normal from Dueling The Vagabond, with the amount being dependent on the type of challenge they endured and whether they won or lost. These possible challenges are as follows:
 
 
 
 Challenge 
 Difficulty 
 Exp for win 
 Exp for loss 
 Exp for  draw

 Occasionally after a Duel with The Vagabond (regardless of victory or defeat), The Vagabond will remark, "That was an interesting Duel. Are your friends as skilled as you? If they are, I would like you to introduce me to one of your friends," whereupon the player is subsequently prompted to pick one of their friends and assign one of the above challenges.
 
 As of January 27, 2020, The Vagabond no longer gives the player a challenge as certain challenges made the duel much too difficult for some players. Instead, the deck's rank in Duel Links' Ranked Duels  determines how much EXP is earned. Earned EXP is based on the following: 
 
 
 Rank
 
 EXP
 
 
 Rookie
 
 1400
 
 
 Bronze
 
 1500
 
 
 Silver
 
 1600
 
 
 Gold
 
 1700
 
 
 Platinum
 
 1800
 
 
 Legendary and above

 Decks 
 The Vagabond can use any Deck used by any other player of Duel Links, and picks a random Deck to use among them when spawning.
 From v2.5.0 onwards, when challenging the Vagabond, the player is told what Deck he is using and who was the player who built it, and is allowed to look at said Deck after the duel.
