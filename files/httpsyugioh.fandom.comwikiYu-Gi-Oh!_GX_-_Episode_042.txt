 Summary 
 A strange, yellow ball of light was floating around  Duel Academy . Apparently, it was  Duel Monsters Spirit Day , the day where students appreciate the Duel Spirits and dress up as their favorite monster. The yellow light was the  spirit  of the " Dark Magician Girl ". She wanted to stop by the Academy and make Spirit Day a day the students will never forget.
 
       Chazz   cosplaying  as " XYZ-Dragon Cannon ".     
 Meanwhile, all around the school, students were celebrating spirit day.  Chumley  and  Syrus  worked together to create a Duel arena outside of the  Slifer Red  dorm, for Syrus’ costume Duel. Dark Magician Girl overhears this and decides to join in. The remaining holders of the  Spirit Keys  meet outside the dorm to discuss what  Atticus  had said in regards to  Professor Banner  - he had been the one to instruct the students to go to the  Abandoned Dorm . Banner had since disappeared, so they believe he is working for the  Shadow Riders . Chazz comes up with the idea of using Banner's cat  Pharaoh  to find Banner, but is unable to locate him either. Having no other options, they agree to just attempt to enjoy Duel Monsters Spirit Day. Syrus attempts to find someone to dress up as "Dark Magician Girl" for the costume Duel, but finds out that  Ms. Dorothy  dressed as "Dark Magician Girl", much to everyone's horror.
 Alexis ,  Mindy  and  Jasmine  go as " Harpie Lady Sisters ", but  Jaden  is unable to decide on a costume, and instead combines pieces of several. He ultimately ends up a combination outfit that contains the parts of other costumes: the hat of " Saggi the Dark Clown ", the body suit of " Breaker the Magical Warrior ", the boots of " Makyura the Destructor ", the shoulder pads of " Celtic Guardian ," and the shield of " Gearfried the Iron Knight ". Once they leave the dressing room, Chazz, dressed as " XYZ-Dragon Cannon ", appears and tells Jaden to get ready for the Duel. 
 
       Jaden and Dark Magician Girl prepare for their Duel.     
 As Jaden prepares to Duel, he asks Syrus, Chazz, and Alexis if they want to duel him. Syrus and Chazz decline the request as they are the hosts, and Alexis chases after Atticus after finding out that he was going to send the picture of her in costume to their family. As Jaden neglects that he has no one to duel, they are approached by someone who appears to have a perfect "Dark Magician Girl" costume, which Syrus instantly recognizes as the one and only  Dark Magician Girl , and she tells Jaden that he can duel her. He accepts her request, but before the Duel begins, takes off his costume out of rage that everyone in the audience hates him, despite Jaden having the home field advantage.  Bastion , dressed as " Amazoness Tiger ",  Velian Crowler , and Syrus' brother  Zane  show up too, seeing Jaden and Dark Magician Girl shuffling. Before the Duel begins, Jaden and Dark Magician Girl wish each other good luck.
 
       Dark Magician Girl smiles in awe of her opponent Summoning Elemental HERO Flame Wingman.     
 During the Duel, Jaden gets constantly annoyed by the jeering he repeatedly gets, but he pulls on through it and manages to make a comeback. Later on, after Dark Magician Girl's "Dark Magician Girl" attacks Jaden's " Elemental HERO Flame Wingman ", Jaden activates one of his Trap Cards he Set face-down, " Staunch Defender ", saying that victory for her wasn't going to happen, even if she has the edge on LP. Dark Magician Girl asks how Jaden is so confident about that, which leads to Jaden revealing his other Trap Card he Set face-down, " Hero Barrier ", which leads to the effects of the two Trap Cards  resolving  backwards and "Flame Wingman's" effect activating, guaranteeing Jaden's victory.
 After the Duel, everyone was curious as to who exactly was the Dark Magician Girl. That night, as Jaden walked around the campfire, he saw Syrus saying his goodbyes to the Dark Magician Girl and that he hoped to see her again someday. The Dark Magician Girl's spirit returned, telling Syrus that she, too, wanted to see Syrus again one day and gives Syrus a kiss. As Syrus prepares to go to bed, thinking that he was hallucinating about the kiss, Jaden tells him that he saw Dark Magician Girl kiss Syrus, who ignores it and tells Jaden that no one kissed him. Jaden gives in, but points out that he thinks Dark Magician Girl has a crush on Syrus. Dark Magician Girl hears this and smiles at the two boys as she departs. Syrus then believes Jaden as he smiles about the fact that he finally got his first kiss. Jaden then laughs hysterically, and Syrus tells Jaden to stop as the episode comes to a close.
 
 Featured Duel: Jaden Yuki vs. Dark Magician Girl 
 Turn 1: Dark Magician Girl 
 Dark Magician Girl  draws " Dark Magician Girl ". She then  Sets  a monster.
 Turn 2: Jaden 
Jaden draws " Elemental HERO Bubbleman " and subsequently Normal Summons it (800/1200) in Attack Position. Since "Bubbleman" was summoned while Jaden had no other cards on his side of the field, its second effect activates, allowing Jaden to draw two cards. [Notes 1] 
 Jaden then activates " Polymerization " to fuse "Bubbleman" with " Elemental HERO Burstinatrix " in order to  Fusion Summon  " Elemental HERO Steam Healer " (1800/1000) in  Attack Position . "Steam Healer" attacks and destroys Dark Magician Girl's  face-down   monster , " Fire Sorcerer " (1000/1500). 
 Since "Fire Sorcerer" was  flipped   face-up , its Flip Effect activates, allowing Dark Magician Girl to remove from play two random cards ("Dark Magician Girl" and "Magician's Valkyria") in her hand and inflict 800  damage  to Jaden (Jaden 4000 → 3200). Since "Steam Healer" destroyed a monster by battle and sent it to the Graveyard, its effect activates, increasing Jaden's Life Points by the  ATK  of the destroyed monster (Jaden 3200 → 4200).
 Turn 3: Dark Magician Girl 
Dark Magician Girl draws. She then Normal Summons " Magician's Valkyria " (1600/1800) in Attack Position. While this card is face-up, Jaden can't select any Spellcaster-type monster besides "Magician's Valkyria" as an attack target. 
 Dark Magician Girl then activates " Dimension Fusion " to  pay  2000 Life Points (Dark Magician Girl 4000 → 2000) and allow both players to  Special Summon  as many removed from play monsters as possible; Dark Magician Girl" Special Summons "Dark Magician Girl" (2000/1700) and a second "Magician's Valkyria" (1600/1800) in Attack Position while Jaden doesn't summon anything. Since Dark Magician Girl now has two "Magician's Valkyria", an attack lock has been formed. 
 "Dark Magician Girl" attacks and destroys "Steam Healer" (Jaden 4200 → 4000). The two "Magician's Valkyria" attack  directly  (Jaden 4000 → 2400 → 800).
 Turn 4: Jaden 
Jaden draws. He then activates " Fusion Recovery " to add "Burstinatrix" and "Polymerization" from his Graveyard to his hand. Jaden then activates "Polymerization" to fuse "Burstinatrix" with " Elemental HERO Avian " in order to Fusion Summon " Elemental HERO Flame Wingman " (2100/1200) in Attack Position. Jaden then Sets two cards.
 Turn 5: Dark Magician Girl 
Dark Magician Girl draws " Magic Formula " and subsequently activates it, equipping it to "Dark Magician Girl" and increasing its ATK by 700 ("Dark Magician Girl": 2000 → 2700/1700). "Dark Magician Girl" attacks "Elemental Hero Flame Wingman", but Jaden activates his face-down " Staunch Defender " and his face-down " Hero Barrier ", with their effects  resolving  in reverse order. 
 First "Hero Barrier"  negates  the attack made by "Dark Magician Girl". Next, "Staunch Defender" forces the two "Magician's Valkyria" to attack "Flame Wingman". "Flame Wingman" destroys both "Magician's Valkyria" (Dark Magician Girl 2000 → 1500 → 1000). Since "Flame Wingman" destroyed monsters by battle and sent them to the Graveyard, its effect activates, inflicting damage to Dark Magician Girl equal to the ATK of her destroyed monsters (Dark Magician Girl 1000 → 0 → 0).
 
 Trivia 
 The first monster Dark Magician Girl uses, " Fire Sorcerer ", was used by  Téa Gardner  in her duel against  Crump  of the  Big Five  in  episode 102  of the  original series  when " Dark Magician Girl " was her  Deck Master . 
 
 
 
 Errors/Mistakes 
 When the effect of "Fire Sorcerer" is activated, it is said that Dark Magician Girl must choose 2 random cards in her hand, however when she goes to pick the cards she chooses them while looking at her entire hand instead of randomly.
