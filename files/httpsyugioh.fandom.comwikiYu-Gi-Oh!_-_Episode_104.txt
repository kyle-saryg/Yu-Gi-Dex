 Summary 
 Joey  is stuck in a large manor and accidentally destroys a wall when he kicks it. A hidden door takes him to the  KaibaCorp  blimp. 
 Inside the blimp he finds  Mai 's unconscious body, but it is actually  Johnson  in disguise. 
 Johnson turns the room into a courthouse and transforms into his  Deck Master , " Judge Man ". Joey chooses " Flame Swordsman " as his Deck Master. 
 Téa  and  Yugi  wander through the Antarctic environment until they find a door. It leads to the room where Joey is Dueling Johnson. 
 Kaiba  and  Mokuba  view another scene from their past. Seto had visited  Gozaburo  in his office at KaibaCorp and proposed a virtual game software to him, but it was thrown back at him since Gozaburo claimed he only cared about building weapons. After having Kaiba removed by security, Gozaburo stole the idea and used it to help build the  Virtual World . This scene affected present-day Kaiba more strongly than any of the previous had. 
 Featured Duel: Joey Wheeler vs. Johnson 
 Joey 's  Deck Master  is " Flame Swordsman ".  Johnson 's Deck Master is " Judge Man ".
 Turn 1: Johnson 
Johnson  Normal Summons   Hysteric Angel  (1800/500) in  Attack Position .
 Turn 2: Joey 
 Joey   draws   Gearfried the Iron Knight  and subsequently Normal Summons it (1800/1600) in Attack Position. He then  activates  the  Deck Master ability  of "Flame Swordsman" to reduce the ATK of "Flame Swordsman" by 500 ("Flame Swordsman": 1800 → 1300/1600) and increase the ATK of "Gearfried" by the decreased amount ("Gearfried": 1800 → 2300/1600). "Gearfried"  attacks  and  destroys  "Hysteric Angel" (Johnson 4000 → 3500).
 Turn 3: Johnson 
Johnson  Sets  a monster.
 Turn 4: Joey 
Joey draws  Rocket Warrior , while his  hand  contains " Tiny Guardian ",  Panther Warrior ,  Swordsman of Landstar ,  Gamble , and  Bottomless Trap Hole . Joey Normal Summons "Tiny Guardian" (1400/1800) in Attack Position. He then activates the Deck Master ability of "Flame Swordsman" to decrease its ATK by 300 ("Flame Swordsman": 1300 → 1000/1600) and increase that of "Tiny Guardian" by the same amount ("Tiny Guardian": 1400 → 1700/1800)."Tiny Guardian" attacks and destroys Johnson's Set monster. It's revealed to be  Skelengel  (900/400), whose  Flip Effect  activates, letting Johnson draw a card. "Gearfried" attacks  directly  (Johnson 3500 → 1200).
 Turn 5: Johnson 
Johnson Normal Summons  Mystical Elf  (800/2000) in  Defense Position  and Sets a card.
 Turn 6: Joey 
Joey draws  Scapegoat . He Normal Summons "Rocket Warrior" (1500/1300) in Attack Position. "Gearfried" attacks "Mystical Elf", but Johnson activates the Deck Master ability of "Judge Man" to  pay  1000  Life Points  (Johnson 1200 → 200) and destroy all monsters Joey controls as well as inflict 500  damage  to Joey for each (Joey 4000 → 2500). Joey's hand contains "Panther Warrior", "Swordsman of Landstar", "Gamble", "Bottomless Trap Hole", and "Scapegoat". Joey Sets "Bottomless Trap Hole".
 Turn 7: Johnson 
Johnson Normal Summons  Curtain of the Dark Ones  (600/500) in Attack Position. He then activates his face-down  Polymerization  to  fuse  "Mystical Elf" with "Curtain of the Dark Ones" and  Fusion Summon   Kamionwizard  (1300/1100) in Attack Position. Johnson then activates " Sinister Justice ", which will let  Fusion Monsters  to he controls attack the  turn  they are Summoned. If a  Level  4 or lower Fusion Monster he controls inflicts  battle damage , he will gain 800 Life Points. "Kamionwizard" attacks directly (Joey 2500 → 1200). The second effect of "Sinister Justice" activates (Johnson 200 → 1000). Johnson Sets a card.
 Duel continues in  the next episode . 
 
 Differences In adaptations 
 When  Joey  chooses his  Deck Master , flashbacks of him using " Flame Swordsman " are removed from the dub. 
 Tristan  and  Duke 's wrestling is cut from the dub. 
 A shot of  Gozaburo  throwing papers at  Kaiba  is cut from the dub. Instead, he scatters them across the floor of his office. 
 Mistakes 
 In the dub,  Joey  calls " Sinister Justice " a  Trap Card . 
 In the dub, in one scene, " Flame Swordsman " is seen on Joey's Duel Disk instead of " Gearfried the Iron Knight " when you can clearly see " Flame Swordsman " is beside him. 
 Trivia 
 Johnson  is the first member of the  Big Five  to assume the form of a monster used by a main character. In this case, " Judge Man " is used by  Kaiba . Ironically, the next, and last, case is  Leichter , who Duels Kaiba as " Jinzo ", Joey's monster.
