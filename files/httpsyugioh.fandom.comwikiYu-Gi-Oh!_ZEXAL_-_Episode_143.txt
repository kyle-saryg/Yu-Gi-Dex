 Summary 
       Nash   activates  " Reincarnation of the Seven Emperors ".     
 Yuma  orders " Number 39: Utopia Beyond " to  attack  " Chaos Xyz Barian Hope ". As "Barian Hope" is bisected,  Nash  yells in anguish, asking why Yuma and  Astral   must keep crushing the dreams of the  Barians . Yuma mutters " Shark ", while  Tori  stares at the explosion (these events are cut from the dub, as they took place in the previous episode) As the smoke clears, Nash emerges and yells that he is not done. He  activates  his  face-down  " Reincarnation of the Seven Emperors ", explaining that it will  banish  "Barian Hope" and its  Overlay Units  to reduce the  Battle Damage  to 0. Yuma is surprised at such a counter, but Nash adds that the card has another effect. He can now  Special Summon  a  Rank  3 or lower  Xyz Monster  from his  Extra Deck  and inflict its  ATK  as  damage  to Yuma.  Yuma is surprised again and Astral mutters that he wasn't expecting a counterattack like this. " Black Ray Lancer " appears in  Attack Position , twirling its spear. Nash claims this is the end of the line, then. Yuma tells him that time has not yet come and activates the effect of "Utopia Beyond". He can  detach  an Overlay Unit to  banish  an Xyz Monster he  controls  and Special Summon " Number 39: Utopia " from his  Graveyard . "Utopia Beyond" soars through the air and sheds most of its armor, revealing the "Utopia" at its core. The effect will then increase his  Life Points  by half the ATK of "Utopia". They rise to 2450, but Nash yells " Black Spear ". "Black Ray Lancer" launches a purple beam from its spear, which hits Yuma.  ZEXAL III  is canceled and Yuma and Astral are thrown backwards, their Life Points falling to 350. Nash breathes heavily, but  Sets  a card and ends his  turn  before falling to his knees and resuming his true human form. 
 Nash mutters "Yuma", while Yuma mutters "Shark" (in the dub, Shark says that it's Yuma's turn, while Yuma doesn't say anything about Shark) Yuma says that "Utopia" and "Black Ray Lancer" are on the  field  now. He adds that he remembers a Duel like this that they had a long time ago (scenes from their Duels in episodes  10  and  84  are shown here; the dub only shows episode 12). Yuma says that though they clashed again and again, they always talked during the Duels too. Nash claims Yuma was just a pest back then, someone who meddled in things that didn't concern him and bluntly shoved his way into people's hearts (in the dub, Nash claims he had to carry Yuma during that Tag Duel - so much that it gave him back spasms, but admits he considers him a friend). Yuma tells Nash that even now, they are still friends. He asks if they can't go back to the way things were. Nash responds that it's impossible - neither of them are the same as they used to be. Yuma questions if he really believes they can no longer understand each other. 
 
       Nash vows to protect the other  Barians .     
 Nash says Yuma doesn't get it - they already understand each other. Nash explains that he's known how Yuma feels for a long time and how he felt when they fought. Yuma mutters "Shark...", but Nash continues that even friends that understand each other may stop being friends. Nash adds that there are people who believe in him and that are still fighting by his side. The spirits of the other  Barian Emperors ,  Iris  and the soldiers of the  United Lands of the Poseidon Ocean  appear around him as he vows that he cannot betray them by losing. Yuma mutters "lose..." and thinks back to  the Door  telling him that he could obtain a new power - but the price would be losing that which is most important to him. Astral turns to Yuma and Yuma thinks about what it is he would lose. Nash tells Yuma to come at him and Yuma wonders if what he'll lose will be Shark or Astral. He determines it must be neither - as he would never allow himself to lose either of his best friends.
 Yuma begins his  turn ,  drawing  and then orders "Utopia" to attack "Black Ray Lancer". Nash yells, "Denied," and activates the effect of the " Friller Shark " in his Graveyard, banishing it to  negate  the attack and decrease the ATK of "Utopia" by 500. Blue light shines from the Graveyard portal and covers "Utopia", reducing its ATK to 2000. Yuma Sets a card and ends his turn there. Nash claims he has not forgotten that when they first met, he was "Shark". He adds that he is not "Shark" right now though - he is Nash of the Barians. He  Barian Battlemorphs , vowing to win the Duel, obtain the  Numeron Code  and lead the  Barian World  to a brighter future. Nash draws and then activates " Xyz Treasure ", letting him draw a card for each Xyz Monster on the field - meaning two. 
 
       " Big Jaws ", " Black Ray Lancer " and " Skull Kraken ".     
 He Special Summons " Big Jaws ", prompting it to appear from a watery cyclone as he explains that he can do so from his hand during a turn he's activated a  Normal Spell Card . He  Normal Summons  " Skull Kraken ", who bursts from the ground before Nash proceeds to  overlay  his two  Level  3 monsters to  Xyz Summon  " Submersible Carrier Aero Shark " in Attack Position, who also bursts up from the ground. Nash activates the effect of "Aero Shark", explaining that he can detach an Overlay Unit to inflict 400 damage to Yuma for each card in his hand. He only has one, but it's enough to defeat Yuma just the same. He claims this is the end once more. Tori yells "NO!" as Nash declares " Torpedo Takedown " and "Aero Shark" fires a single torpedo. Astral tells Yuma to use the  Trap  now and Yuma does so, activating his face-down " Damage Take-Over ". The torpedo hits and Yuma explains that this card reduces the damage to 0 as he and Astral fly through the air. The card then  attaches  itself to an Xyz Monster he controls, also causing that monster to lose ATK equal to the damage he would have taken. The ATK of "Utopia" falls to 1600. Nash is nonplussed, ordering "Black Ray Lancer" to attack "Utopia". Yuma says he won't let that happen and activates the effect of "Utopia", detaching an Overlay Unit to negate the attack. Yuma declares " Light Wing Shield ". The attack rebounds off the shield, but Nash says "Utopia" has no Overlay Units now. He orders "Aero Shark" to attack "Utopia". He muses that while only " Numbers " can destroy "Numbers" by  battle , they'll still take damage. "Aero Shark" simply rams "Utopia", reducing Yuma to 50 Life Points. Tori screams both Yuma's and Astral's names as they fly backwards. Nash Sets a card to end his turn. 
 
         Tori  tells  Yuma  not to give up.     
 Astral is fading in and out now. Tori can't believe their Life Points are only 50. Yuma wonders to himself if Shark is really this determined. He gets to his knees, groaning. He muses that Shark is just as strong as  Kite . Yuma remarks that seeing how strong he is makes him want to laugh (in the dub, Kite is not mentioned and Yuma refers to Shark as one of the strongest Duelists in the galaxy). Astral mutters Yuma's name. Yuma says he just hoped that everyone could be stay friends, but that may not be possible now. This Duel has not found them the answer they wanted. Defeating  Don Thousand  alongside Nash meant nothing - now they're fighting each other (in the dub, Don Thousand is not mentioned and Yuma determines that he's failed all three worlds). Tori turns her head in sadness, closing her eyes as tears form. She opens her eyes and yells for Yuma not to give up. She insists that it isn't like him to decide he's gone far enough - everyone has bet their hopes on him. Yuma mutters her name, but Tori urges him to stand tall until the very end. Yuma is flabbergasted, but Astral smiles and says she just scolded him like  Kari  would have (in the dub, Kari is not mentioned and Astral quips that shouting can be very persuasive). Yuma realizes she's right - he can still find an answer. 
 Yuma thinks back to the sacrifices of  Bronk ,  Nistro ,  Nelson ,  Anna ,  Quattro ,  Quinton ,  Trey  and Kite (in the dub, Yuma adds that he would rather face ten Sharks than an angry Tori). Yuma turns to Astral and tells him it's time again. They overlay, chanting, "Our hearts and minds shine with hope. Our souls are bound by the true bonds of friendship. When two souls cross, a miraculous power handed down through the ages appears" ("When two distant souls become one, the power of ZEXAL is revealed" in the dub). They appear now as ZEXAL III. Nash urges them to hit him with everyone they have left (in the dub, Nash says it doesn't matter if Yuma and Astral used ZEXAL; he will crush them anyway). Yuma agrees and moves to draw, chanting, "Everything is inevitable in the Duels between the strongest Duelists. Those Duelists can create the very cards they draw!  Shining Draw !" 
 
         " Number 39: Utopia " docks with  ZEXAL Weapon - Sylphid Wing ".     
 Yuma says his card has come and Normal Summons " ZW - Sylphid Wing |ZEXAL Weapon - Sylphid Wing]]". Astral explains the effect as "Utopia" flies into the air and gains itself a second set of wings in the form of "Sylphid Wing". As they control a " Number 39: Utopia " monster, this card can be  equipped  to it and increase its ATK by 800. They declare "Sylphid Change" as the ATK of "Utopia" rises to 2400. Yuma orders "Utopia" to attack "Aero Shark", but Nash activates his face-down " Rebirth of the Seven Emperors ". This lets him  Tribute  all Xyz Monsters he controls to Special Summon the Xyz Monster he banished during his last turn with "Reincarnation of the Seven Emperors". Yuma asks "what!?" as "Barian Hope" rises again, but wih 0 ATK. Tori is shocked that that monster is back. Nash explains that "Rebirth of the Seven Emperors" then lets him attach a number of his banished Xyz Monsters to the Summoned monster equal to the number of Xyz Monsters he Tributed plus one as Overlay Units.. He attaches " Chaos Number 101: Silent Honor DARK ", " Chaos Number 102: Archfiend Seraph " and " Chaos Number 103: Ragnafinity ". The ATK of "Barian Hope" rises to 3000 via its own effect, but Nash adds that the monster Summoned with "Rebirth of the Seven Emperors" cannot activate any effects that require detaching. 
 
         Yuma activates " Double or Nothing! ".     
 Yuma yells that he's not done yet, while Astral explains that when the opponent Special Summons an Xyz Monster, the effect of "Sylphid Wing" will increase the equipped monster's ATK by 1600 - ergo, the ATK of "Utopia" becomes 4000. Yuma orders "Utopia" to attack "Barian Hope" with " Hope Sword Sylphid Slash ". Nash says they won't do that just yet and activates his face-down " Draw of Fate ", forcing both players to draw a card and negate the attack. A blue lightning bolt shocks "Utopia" and Yuma mutters that even that attack was countered. Nash adds that that's not the only effect - if the player does not use the card they've drawn with this effect by the end of this turn, they will  automatically lose . Yuma yells "WHAT!?" Nash claims this will be their "destiny draw" - their final draw that will decide everything. Yuma mutters "final draw...", while Nash urges them to come at him now. He declares " Chaos Draw " and draws, while Yuma yells "Shining Draw!". They both examine their drawn cards and Yuma asks if this is truly their card of destiny. Astral asks if they will win now or if Nash will - everything hung on the balance of that draw. Yuma yells " kattobingu " and activates " Double or Nothing! ". As an attack was negated, this card doubles that monster's ATK and allows it to attack again. Astral muses that the goddess of victory is smiling on them now, for the first time during this Duel. Yuma says this will be their victory. 
 
         Yuma cancels  ZEXAL .     
 He thinks back to the Door's words though - "though shalt lose that which is most important to thee." Yuma suddenly realizes what the Door meant and cancels ZEXAL. Astral asks why he'd to that and Yuma explains that the Door's words have come true - he has lost that which is most important to him - himself. He doesn't consider himself to be the same person anymore. He always understood the feelings of his friends and enemies with Dueling. He always fought believing in that. But if he wins this Duel here, he would use the god-like power of the Numeron Code to erase the life Shark has lived up until now. He says that Shark is still his precious friend and doesn't believe that it would be worth creating a better future if it cost him Shark. He says he knew everyone placed their hopes on him, but he cannot do this (in the dub, Yuma recalls that he made plenty of friends through Dueling, and he was this close to finishing Shark off for good, but he now realizes this was wrong because he Dueled to make friends not beat them. Yuma resolves to do what he feels right by not defeating Shark). Astral closes his eyes and says he understands. He states that Yuma has opened the path to the future by believing in others no matter what - through that, they always found an answer (in the dub, Astral is puzzled by the paradox Yuma stated: he refused to win, but losing the Duel would mean the destruction of the Astral World, but trusts that Yuma will be able to solve it). Yuma mutters Astral's name, but then addresses Nash, saying he'll come at him now. Nash yells to both of them to bring it on. Yuma activates the effect of "Sylphid Wing". When the equipped monster attacks, he can attach "Sylphid Wing" to it as an Overlay Unit. The ATK of "Utopia" falls to 5600. 
 Nash asks why he's done this, but Yuma just orders "Utopia" to attack "Barian Hope" with " Rising Sun Sylphid Slash ". Yuma then activates the effect of "Utopia", detaching an Overlay Unit to negate his own attack. Just as "Utopia" is about to strike "Barian Hope", its swords vanish from its hands. Tori has no idea what Yuma is doing, while Nash asks what Yuma is planning. Yuma claims he's planning nothing - he's just refusing to sacrifice Shark for the sake of the future. Nash calls him an idiot and asks if he evens knows what he's saying. Yuma insists that he does. Even if they have only 50 Life Points, they will keep taking any blows that come their way until they find a new future - no matter how long that takes. Nash asks if that's the answer they found then. Astral confirms this and Yuma adds that they have no regrets. Yuma says he would cease to be himself if he threw his friends away - that is how he will "kattobingu". 
 
         " Glory of the Seven Emperors " finishes Nash.     
 Nash closes his eyes and muses that Yuma is a blithering idiot as usual. He activates " Glory of the Seven Emperors ", explaining he can do so from his hand if he controls a " C " monster. It will attach every banished " Number C " he has to an Xyz Monster he controls. " Chaos Number 104: Umbral Horror Masquerade ", " Chaos Number 105: Battlin' Boxer Comet Cestus ", " Chaos Number 106: Giant Red Hand " and " Chaos Number 107: Neo Galaxy-Eyes Tachyon Dragon " attach themselves to "Barian Hope", increasing its ATK to 7000. Nash specifies that during this turn, "Barian Hope" can't be  destroyed by battle  and no damage can be inflicted to him - that damage will be inflicted to Yuma and Astral instead. Astral is shocked - he says that this means that if the ATK powered-up by "Double or Nothing!" would have gone through, they would have lost. Yuma asks if this turn's battle is a draw then. Nash says it isn't - Yuma and Astral have won. Yuma asks what he means and Nash explains that "Glory of the Seven Emperors" will cause his Life Points to become the same as the change in his opponent's Life Points at the end of the  Battle Phase . He adds that the change was 0, so his Life Points become 0 right now. "Barian Hope" and its Chaos Overlay Units fade away, while a circle of light covers Nash's feet. Yuma mutters "Shark", but an huge explosion wrecks Nash's position. Yuma yells "Shark!" as Nash's Life Points fall to 0 and he flies backwards, reverting to his human form (In the dub Yuma yelling Shark is cut and Shark is reborn the instant Yuma wins).
 
Nash thinks that the outcome truly surprised him (In the dub, Shark admits says he never knew losing felt this good). Yuma and Astral rush towards him as he hits the ground. Yuma yells "Shark!" twice more. Nash attempts to rise, but groans. He says he knew they would use "Double or Nothing!" He gets to his feet and says that they were too good-hearted to attack though (in the dub, Shark claims he would be alright if Yuma had not screamed his ears off like a banshee). He claims Yuma and Astral have infected him with those words. Astral asks if he planned this from the beginning. Nash tells him not to be foolish - he was serious the entire time, but he has no regrets (in the dub, Shark says that though he lost, it's a million times better than having to Duel Yuma forever. He adds that that strategy was the dumbest he's ever seen, but that that's what he likes about Yuma. Astral tells Shark it was a privilege to Duel him, with Shark responding in kind). Nash tells Yuma that most people throw away what's most important to them as they grow up. He urges Yuma to never do that - his ability to believe in others and his pure heart and soul that never give up. Nash says he wants to see the future they'll create, but he doesn't think he'll be able to (in the dub, Shark tells Astral to look after Yuma for him and that his long journey has come to an end. He tells Yuma to believe in his friends, his family and himself). Shark begins begins to fade, and addresses Tori, telling her to never take her eyes off Yuma for a second (in the dub, Shark does not mention Tori, but thanks Yuma for teaching him to  feel the flow ). Nash thanks Yuma and Astral both, calling them his friends of the future. He adds that that final Duel, until the final second, was the greatest Duel he ever played - and the greatest one he ever enjoyed (In the dub Shark is sad to not see Yuma's future thinking he won't be revived to see it). Yuma yells "SHARK!" again. Shark says goodbye and finally fades completely. Tori turns her head and sobs. Light begins to break through the pink Barian clouds as seagulls fly around. They find themselves back at the docks in  Heartland City . Yuma's eyes close and he begins to scream in tears.
 
 Featured Duel: Yuma Tsukumo vs. Nash 
 Duel continues from  the previous episode . 
 
         " CXyz Barian Hope " and the " Number C10X " monsters are  banished .     
 Turn 7: Nash 
" Number 39: Utopia Beyond " has just destroyed " Chaos Xyz Barian Hope " in battle. As an  Xyz Monster  that had " Chaos Over Hundred Number "  monsters   attached  to it was  destroyed by battle ,  Nash   activates  his  face-down  " Reincarnation of the Seven Emperors " to  banish  it and all its  Chaos Overlay Units  in order to reduce the  battle damage  to 0. Nash then activates the second effect of "Reincarnation of the Seven Emperors" to  Special Summon  " Black Ray Lancer " ( 3/2100/600) from his  Extra Deck  in  Attack Position  (as it's a  Rank  3 or lower Xyz Monster) and inflict  damage  to  Yuma  equal to the Summoned monster's  ATK  at the end of the  Battle Phase .
 Yuma activates the final  effect  of "Utopia Beyond" to  detach  "Utopia" ("Utopia Beyond": 1 → 0 ORU), banish "Utopia Beyond" (an Xyz Monster), revive " Number 39: Utopia " ( 4/2500/2000) in Attack Position and gain  Life Points  equal to half its ATK (Yuma: 1200 → 2450 LP). At the end of the Battle Phase, the final effect of "Reincarnation of the Seven Emperors" activates (Yuma: 2450 → 350 LP). Yuma and  Astral  cancel  ZEXAL Morph  and Nash  Sets  a card.
 
         " Number 39: Utopia " is weakened by " Friller Shark ".     
 Turn 8: Yuma 
Yuma draws "Damage Take-Over". "Utopia"  attacks  "Black Ray Lancer", but Nash activates the effect of " Friller Shark " to banish it from his Graveyard,  negate  the attack, and decrease the ATK of Utopia by 500 ("Utopia": 2500 → 2000 ATK). Yuma Sets a card.
 
         " Black Ray Lancer " and " Submersible Carrier Aero Shark ".     
 Turn 9: Nash 
Nash  draws  " Xyz Treasure " and subsequently activates it to draw two cards (one for each Xyz Monster on the  field ). As he activated a  Normal Spell Card  this turn, he Special Summons " Big Jaws " ( 3/1800/300) in Attack Position via own effect. He then  Normal Summons  " Skull Kraken " ( 3/600/1600) in Attack Position. Nash  overlays  "Big Jaws" and "Skull Kraken" in order to  Xyz Summon  " Submersible Carrier Aero Shark " ( 
3/1900/1000, ORU: 2) in Attack Position. 
 Nash activates the effect of "Submersible Carrier Aero Shark" to detach an Overlay Unit ("Submersible Carrier Aero Shark": 2 → 1 ORU) and inflict 400 damage for each card in his hand. He has one, but Yuma activates his face-down " Damage Take-Over " to subtract that value from the ATK of "Utopia" (an Xyz Monster) instead ("Utopia": 2000 → 1600 ATK) and attach "Damage Take-Over" to "Utopia" as an Overlay Unit ("Utopia": 0 → 1 ORU). "Black Ray Lancer" attacks "Utopia", but Yuma activates the effect of "Utopia" to detach an Overlay Unit ("Utopia": 1 → 0 ORU) and negate the attack. "Submersible Carrier Aero Shark" attacks "Utopia", but the latter is not destroyed since the former is not a " Number " monster (Yuma: 350 → 50 LP). Nash Sets a card.
 
         "Utopia" equipped with " ZW - Sylphid Wing ".     
 Turn 10: Yuma 
Yuma and Astral perform a ZEXAL Morph, overlaying themselves into  ZEXAL III . Yuma performs a  Shining Draw  and gets " ZW - Sylphid Wing ". Yuma Normal Summons "ZW - Sylphid Wing" ( 4/800/1600) in Attack Position. Yuma activates the first effect of "Sylphid Wing" to  equip  it to "Utopia" (a " Number 39: Utopia " monster) and increase its ATK by 800 ("Utopia": 1600 → 2400 ATK). 
 "Utopia" attacks "Submersible Carrier Aero Shark", but Nash activates his face-down " Rebirth of the Seven Emperors " to  Tribute  all his Xyz Monsters and Special Summon "Barian Hope" ( 7/0/0) from the Banished Zone in Attack Position (as it was the monster banished by "Reincarnation of the Seven Emperors"), though it will not be able to activate any effects that would be activating by detaching Overlay Units. The effect of "Rebirth of the Seven Emperors" then attaches " Chaos Number 101: Silent Honor DARK ", " Chaos Number 102: Archfiend Seraph " and " Chaos Number 103: Ragnafinity " to "Barian Hope" ("Barian Hope": 0 → 3000 ATK, 0 → 3 ORU) as Chaos Overlay Units (the number of banished "Chaos Over-Hundred Numbers" attached to it is equal to the number of Tributed Xyz Monsters +1). At the end of this turn's Battle Phase, players will take 300 damage for each card in their own hand. As an Xyz Monster was Special Summoned by the opponent, Yuma activates the second effect of "Sylphid Wing" to increase the ATK of "Utopia" by 1600 ("Utopia": 2400 → 4000 ATK). A replay occurs, and "Utopia" attacks "Barian Hope", but Nash activates his face-down " Draw of Fate " to negate the attack and make both players draw a card. If a player does not use the drawn card by the end of this turn, they will  automatically lose . 
 
         "Barian Hope" and "Utopia" stop their  battle .     
 Through  Shining Draw , Yuma draws " Double or Nothing! " while Nash draws "Glory of the Seven Emperors" through  Chaos Draw . Yuma activates "Double or Nothing!" to double the ATK of "Utopia" and let it attack again ("Utopia": 4000 → 8000 ATK). "Utopia" attacks "Barian Hope", but after realizing what  the Door  told him previously, Yuma activates the final effect of "Sylphid Wing" to attach it to "Utopia" as an Overlay Unit ("Utopia": 8000 → 5600 ATK, 0 → 1 ORU). Yuma activates the effect of "Utopia" to negate the attack by detaching "Sylphid Wing" ("Utopia": 1 → 0 ORU). 
 As he controls a " C " monster, Nash activates " Glory of the Seven Emperors " from his hand to attach all banished "Chaos Over-Hundred Number" monsters to "Barian Hope" (an Xyz Monster). He attaches " Chaos Number 104: Umbral Horror Masquerade ", " Chaos Number 105: Battlin' Boxer Comet Cestus ", " Chaos Number 106: Giant Red Hand ", and " Chaos Number 107: Neo Galaxy-Eyes Tachyon Dragon " to "Barian Hope" ("Barian Hope": 3000 → 7000 ATK, 3 → 7 ORU). Nash explains that the second effect of "Glory of the Seven Emperors" also makes Yuma take the battle damage that Nash would take from a battle involving "Barian Hope" this turn. At the end of the Battle Phase, the final effect of "Rebirth of the Seven Emperors" activates, but both players have no cards in their hand. During the  End Phase , the final effect of "Glory of the Seven Emperors" activates, causing Nash's Life Points to become equal to the total change in Yuma's Life Points since "Glory of the Seven Emperors" resolved (Nash: 1200 → 0 LP).

 When  Yuma  cancels  ZEXAL Morph , " Number C39: Utopia Ray " can be seen on his  D-Pad  instead of " Number 39: Utopia ". 
         The Japanese card for "Damage Takeover" shown in the dub. (Note: Hulu's overlay for the dub, and Astral is censored)     In the dub, when Yuma activates "Damage Takeover", during the next scene where the card is shown from the side and Yuma shouts, "Brace yourself, Astral!", the original Japanese card can be made out instead of the dub's design.
