 Design 
 Appearance 
       Number 96's full appearance.     
 Number 96, when not in its card form, appears similar to  Astral , but with a jet black body, instead of light blue. Unlike Astral, whose right eye has a white sclera, Number 96 has a black sclera, but a gold iris on his left eye, like Astral. However, the markings where Number 96's eyebrows would be are longer, the top ends stretching into his forehead and becoming crooked (resembling horns of some sort) and the bottom ends having a spike on each that line his nose. These marks are red instead of his other green marks. He is capable of forming a ghostly tail and having "tentacles" that stretch out from his body.
 As with Astral, the dub version has Number 96's lower body sometimes blurred off to remove any nudity implications. Lastly and likewise, Number 96's  D-Pad  is the same one Astral uses except it is purple instead of blue. [2] 
 
       Full appearance of Number 96's  Chaos Form .     
 When Number 96 used " Rank-Up-Magic Barian's Force " on his  card form , his own physical appearance significantly changed. He gained a  Barian Emblem  on his forehead, an eye on his abdomen much like  Don Thousand  and a pair of wings with red jewels. His muscle mass grew considerably and also became more pronounced. His hair gained volume, his right eye is no longer black, and his voice deepened significantly, but only for one episode. [3] 
 
 Personality 
 Unlike its counterparts, Number 96 is a malicious entity who desires the power of the other " Numbers " so that he may become the most powerful of them all. He is cunning enough to allow himself to be absorbed by  Astral  so that he may possess him from the inside and steal his "Numbers". Number 96 also enjoys sadistically manipulating his hosts and brutally defeating his enemies. While working with  Vector , Number 96 comments that Vector resembles "a second rate villain" due to his usage of tricks to manipulate Duels. [3] 
 Number 96 considers his  card form  to be his "other self". He also considers himself to be the "darkness" to Astral's "light". To that end, he also, constantly tells Astral that he needs his power to win and will someday become evil. [4]  After having obtained the power of  Chaos , he develops a God complex and sets his sights on destroying all three parallel worlds in a fit to testing his newfound power and attaining his goal of crushing Astral and Yuma together. [5] 
 According to  Don Thousand , Number 96 was actually a fragment of his own power, that was embedded in Astral's body when he fought against him eons ago. This made Vector finally understand why an individual like Number 96 was inside Astral. [6] 
 
 Abilities 
 Number 96 is shown to be an extremely powerful " Number " card, having escaped the  Emperor's Key  a total of three times. He is able to possess people like regular "Numbers" and have full control of them. He is also capable of possessing  Astral , but only when the Emperor's Key has been removed. [1]  Unlike other Numbers, he can also manifest and even Duel opponents without a host. [2]

 After  Ranking Up  with  Barian  power, he effectively became immune to being re-absorbed by Astral. [3]  His powers were intensely magnified later upon gaining control over his newfound  power of Chaos . He can open portals and launch extremely powerful  energy balls  much like the  Barians , as seen when he attacked the  Astral World  and the  Barian World . He can even create a  Sphere Field  without the aid of a  Barian Sphere Cube . [5] 
 
 Biography 
 History 
 During the battle between  Astral  and  Don Thousand , a fragment of Thousand's soul was trapped inside Astral. It eventually developed into the form of Number 96. [6] 
 
 Yu-Gi-Oh! ZEXAL 
 Pre-World Duel Carnival 
         The fake form of Number 96.     
 After the " Numbers " were released, Number 96 came into the possession of an  unnamed man . Under his control, Number 96 appeared as a black, blob-like creature. After the man was defeated by  Yuma Tsukumo ,  Astral  absorbed the " Number ". The man did not use the  effects  of this "Number", as the "Number" himself wished to be passed on to Yuma. [1] 
 When  Bronk Stone  knocked the  Emperor's Key  from Yuma's neck, it could no longer contain the power of the malevolent "Number". He appeared before them as a blackened version of Astral and imprisoned the original version, who told Yuma to entrust Bronk with " Number 39: Utopia ". At this point, Number 96's appearance in the Duel shifted from its blob-form to a more humanoid one with claws, fangs, and a skull-like torso. [1] 
 
         Number 96 being reabsorbed.     
 Number 96 then manipulated Yuma as a puppet in order to Duel Bronk, using Yuma's cards to Summon his own. He was capable of manipulating Yuma's actions, but not his words. In this way, Yuma tricked Number 96 into  destroying  Bronk's  Set  " Gearspring Exploder ". That allowed Bronk to use "Utopia" with the  effects  of his " Gearspring "  Spell Cards  and defeat "Dark Mist". Bronk then threw the Emperor's Key back to Yuma and Astral is freed, allowing him to absorb Number 96 once again. [1] 
 
 World Duel Carnival Preliminaries 
         Number 96 confronts  Utopia  in  Emperor's Key .     
 While  Yuma  confronted  Dextra  and  Nistro  during the  WDC , Number 96 appeared within  Emperor's Key  to confront Astral. Astral asked if he broke the seal, and Number 96 responded that that's what the " Numbers " wanted to begin with. Astral questioned why the other "Numbers" gave their strength to Number 96, who responded once more that it's what they wanted. It's what all "Numbers" want - the world's destruction. He claimed that Astral also wanted the same. Astral denied it, but Number 96 pointed out his very presence as proof against that. He told Astral to remember his mission and join the "Numbers". He assaulted Astral, who was defended by  Utopia . Number 96 asked if Utopia meant to stand against them and concluded he'll just start by absorbing him first. He continued his assault via the use of his own card. [7]  After Astral sent "Utopia" off, Number 96 captured and began to infect him. His plan failed as a light helps Astral break free, at the same time Number 96 disappeared. [8] 
 
 Yu-Gi-Oh! ZEXAL II 
 Barian Invasion 
         Number 96 aiding Astral and Yuma.     
 Number 96 appeared once more when  Astral  was recovering inside the  Emperor's Key  from the effects of the  Barian Sphere Cube . Number 96 told him that he could not win against the  Barians  without accepting his evil side. Later, he appeared before  Yuma  and Astral, insisting that they cannot win against the  Shadow Giant  without his power. When the two are about to lose, he convinced Astral to unseal him, as Yuma could be hurt if they lose. Number 96 assisted them as Yuma Summoned " Number 96: Dark Mist " to win the Duel and then vanished. After briefly appearing out of the Emperor's Key, Number 96 told Astral that there will be events in the future that will require him to become evil, before vanishing again. [4] 
 
 Mythyrian Number War 
         Number 96 vs. Astral.     
 After escaping the  Emperor's Key , Number 96 traveled to South America, where he took possession of a wealthy politician named  Parker . He was eventually approached by  Vector , who urged him to reveal his true form. Vector offered to be Number 96's servant, introducing himself as one of the  Seven Barian Emperors . Number 96 found this amusing and Vector insisted that he simply wanted to be at the right hand of the true king. Vector told him the location of a  Mythyrian "Number"  and gave him " Rank-Up-Magic Barian's Force " as proof of loyalty. Number 96 left Parker's body behind and journeyed with Vector to the  ruins  where the Number was located. He defeated the  guardian ,  Battle Ox , and obtained the card. They then set a trap for Yuma and Astral after Vector detected their incoming. Separating the two, Astral was forced to Duel Number 96 on his own, with Number 96 hoping to win control over Astral's body. Number 96 revealed that whenever he is  attacked , the temple's traps activate on Yuma, each having the potential to kill him. Using " Malicevorous "  monsters , Number 96 brought out  his own card  and proceeded to use " Small Stopper " to prevent Astral from playing defensively, which Astral got around with " Number 39: Utopia " and " Exchange Guard Robe ". Vector activated one of the ruins' traps, a huge pendulum blade on Yuma's platform. [2] 
 
         Number 96's body transformed into  Chaos Form .     
 Number 96 Summoned his new  Mythyrian "Number" , " Number 65: Djinn Buster ". Between it and "Number 96", Astral was quickly reduced to 600  Life Points , as he refused to use "Exchange Guard Robe" again for fear of Yuma's life. Astral attempted to defend with " Swordsman of Revealing Light ", but Number 96 used his new " Rank-Up " card to Summon " Number C65: King Overfiend ", which, together with "Dark Mist" destroyed the "Swordsman". Astral narrowly hung on by reviving "Utopia" with " Xyz Reborn " and used " Superior Overlay " to destroy "Overfiend". " Number C39: Utopia Ray " was Summoned, which almost destroyed "Dark Mist", but Number 96 used " Chaos Return " to activate "Barian's Force" again, Summoning " Number C96: Dark Storm , whose effect ended the Duel in a  DRAW . Vector pulled a chain to initiate a self-destruct system in the ruins while he and Number 96 fled. While traveling through dimensions, Number 96 left Vector and told his "underling" to find him if he has another plan. [3] 
 
         Number 96's last attempt to take Astral's body.     
 After this, Number 96 worked to master the power of Chaos that he had obtained, determined to use it to defeat Yuma and Astral. Having tamed the power, he believed he had surpassed Astral and determined that he was a "god" now. He launched an assault, which affected  Earth  and both the  Barian  and  Astral Worlds  as he wished to destroy everything. He pulled Yuma, Astral,  Shark ,  Kite  and  Tori  to his location and began a Duel with Yuma and Astral, generating a  Barian Sphere Field  without the use of a  Barian Sphere Cube , which caused damage to Yuma. Using the " Chaos Field ", he stole " Number 69: Heraldry Crest " and " Number 92: Heart-eartH Dragon " from Yuma's  Extra Deck  and Ranked them up. [5]  Despite the advantage of his  Field Spell Card , Number 96 was eventually defeated by the duo through the power of  ZEXAL II . After the Duel, he attempted to take Astral's body for his own anyway (causing the latter to revert to the  darker color scheme he'd had when influenced by the  power of Chaos ). However, Astral sacrificed his energy to seal Number 96 with an explosion, draining him enough that he was forced to return to the Astral World. [9] 
 With his defeat, he was sealed in a ball of light, his power returning to its origin -  Don Thousand . He and  Vector  would put the power he retrieved from Number 96 to use by producing  fake "Numbers" . [6]  This also resulted in Vector obtaining his card form [10]  and the Mythyrian "Number" he had. [11]
