 Events 
 Prior events 
 Tragoedia was caught intruding in the  Shrine of Wedju , shortly after his disciple committed suicide after a failed attempt to kill the pharaoh.
 Akhenaden, Kalim's predecessor, and Seto's predecessor questioned Tragoedia's involvement. When he refused to answer, they opted to perform the  Weighing of the Heart  to measure his sins.
 
 The weighing 
 Seto's predecessor Summoned the White Feathered Spirit,  Winged Kuriboh , who assimilated Tragoedia's heart and rested on one end of the  Millennium Scales . Kalim's predecessor, the holder of the Millennium Scales, placed the  Feather of Ma'at  on the other end of the Scales. The White Feathered Spirit represented the sins of Tragoedia's heart, while the Feather represented his good deeds.
 The side of Tragoedia's sins quickly slammed to the ground and was so heavy that the White Feathered Spirit turned black. The priests were astonished that a man's sins could be so heavy, but Tragoedia laughed that theirs must also be heavy after what they did at  Kul Elna . He claimed that the weight of his crimes was equal to the weight of the crimes they committed at Kul Elna and described his as the weight of revenge.
 
 Aftermath 
 Tragoedia transformed into a monster and Seto's predecessor tried to seal him in a stone slab. Tragoedia attempted to counter, but his  Heka  was weak as the White Feathered Spirit had assimilated it. He tried to grab the White Feather Spirit, but it assimilated the Feather of Ma'at, making him unable to touch it. Seto's predecessor then sealed the monster Tragoedia in a stone slab.
