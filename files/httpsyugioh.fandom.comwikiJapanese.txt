Japanese  is the primary, and first official, card language of the  OCG .  Their ID is  JP .  Japanese cards distributed outside of Japan but in Asian countries are referred to as " Japanese-Asian " cards.
 Japanese cards are written in traditional  kanji , but some cards are abbreviated using  ruby text  and sometimes  furigana .  For example: The Japanese translation to the " Number " archetype is 「 Ｎｏ． 」.  「Ｎｏ．」 is the base text used as an abbreviation, while 「ナンバーズ」 is the ruby text/furigana used to translate the abbreviation. This particular way of formatting text is crucial for  archetype  plays, and therefore has also been adopted to some degree by the  Korean   OCG .
