 " Legendary Dragon " ( 伝 説 の 竜   Densetsu no Ryū ) is an  archetype  of the dragon forms of the three " Legendary Knights ". The archetype was introduced in  Dragons of Legend  and was featured in the  Waking the Dragons  arc of the  Yu-Gi-Oh!  anime.
 Despite all of the members of this archetype lacking "Legendary Dragon" in their names, they each include a  name condition  that causes them to always be treated as "Legendary Dragon" cards.
 The names of the "Legendary Dragons" come from the ancient philosopher  Plato 's workings. The specific body part in the name corresponds to where they were stabbed and sealed during the war in the  Yu-Gi-Oh!  anime.
 " Legendary Dragon of White " is not a "Legendary Dragon" card because it does not have 「 伝説 の 竜 」 in its Japanese name. This is not an issue because it is not legal.

 Anime 
 These cards first appeared in the  Waking the Dragons  arc of the  Yu-Gi-Oh!  anime.
 Yugi Muto ,  Joey Wheeler  and  Seto Kaiba  each receive 1 of the 3 Legendary Dragon cards: " The Eye of Timaeus ", " The Claw of Hermos " and " The Fang of Critias ", respectively. According to Kaiba, the Dragon he received, "Critias", seemed just as powerful as the  Egyptian God Cards .
 These cards are the dragon forms of the three " Legendary Knights " who used to live in the  Dominion of the Beasts  and answered  Ironheart 's call to defend  Atlantis .  Dartz  transformed them into dragons to weaken them. The great ancient war ended in a draw, with the Dragons sealed away in their realm and the Leviathan severely weakened and diminished to a shadow.
 Although their names are known prior to their release in the dub anime, in the original anime, no one—not even the monsters—knows the names of these dragons except for their chosen Duelists, who learn their name upon releasing them, without even being told what their names are. Thus, they are referred to as the Nameless Dragons in the Japanese anime sometimes even by their chosen Duelists.
 
 Properties 
       The Legendary Dragons being played in  Monster Card Zones  in the anime     
 In the anime, they do not belong to any regular card type; their cards are colored blueish, but not the same as  Ritual Monsters . They can be played whilst " Spell Canceller " is on the  field , so are not  Spell Cards  unlike in the  TCG / OCG . They are usually played in  Monster Card Zones , but  Yami Yugi  placed " The Eye of Timaeus " in a  Spell & Trap Card Zone  during his Duel with  Weevil Underwood .
 " The Eye of Timaeus " can fuse with other  monsters  to become new  Fusion Monsters .  Yami Yugi  fused this card with " Dark Magician " and " Dark Magician Girl " to form the respective  Fusion Monsters : " Amulet Dragon " and " Dark Magician Girl the Dragon Knight ". He once attempted to fuse it with " Poison Butterfly " but it did not work as at this point Yami Yugi had lost Timaeus' trust, because he played " The Seal of Orichalcos ".
 The " Claw of Hermos " can fuse with other monsters to form new  Equip Spells .  Joey  fused this card with " Time Wizard ", " Red-Eyes Black Dragon ", " Rocket Warrior " and " Big Bang Blow " to make the respective  Equip Spells : " Time Magic Hammer ", " Red-Eyes Black Dragon Sword ", " Rocket Hermos Cannon " and " Big Bang Dragon Blow ". In addition,  Yami Yugi  also fused " Queen's Knight " with this card to form " Goddess Bow ".
 The " Fang of Critias " can fuse with  Traps  to form new  Fusion Monsters  with  effects  similar to the Trap Card.  Seto Kaiba  fused this card with " Crush Card ", " Tyrant Wing " and " Mirror Force " to form the respective  Fusion Monsters : " Doom Virus Dragon ", " Tyrant Burst Dragon ",  Blue-Eyes Tyrant Dragon , and " Mirror Force Dragon ".
 " Legend of Heart " allows them to transform into their  Legendary Knight  forms: " Legendary Knight Timaeus ", " Legendary Knight Hermos " and " Legendary Knight Critias ". These three Legendary Knights, under the right conditions, can also be combined to form " Timaeus the Knight of Destiny ".
