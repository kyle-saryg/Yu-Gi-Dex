 ... are you serious?  Yu-Gi-Oh! 5D's  has been out for over a year. It has a mention on this article and we have plenty of articles on 5D's topics. --  Deltaneos  ( talk ) 22:56, 2 June 2009 (UTC) 
 No, Well, yes I am serious, but no that is not what I meant. I meant specifically on this article. You know, more information. Even Yugioh capsule monesters has more descrition. Plus, it doesnt mention 5'ds characters in the character portion. It doesn't mention 5'ds at all in the centeral plot area either. -- Qim1  03:01, 4 June 2009 (UTC)

 Yugioh Changes 
 Did anyone exept me see how they changed from a childish "light" toon to a brutal anime
The toughest part in Yugioh was when Kaiba beats people, in Gx it was the semikilling and the death of hell kaiser Ryo, but in 5D's there are people falling of skyscrapers, guys with "guns" so preety much a lot of dieing!
 do you still think you were brought by a stork?
