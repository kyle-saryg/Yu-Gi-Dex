 This card can be searched by " Single Purchase ", " Temple of the Kings ", " Ties of the Brethren ", " Painful Escape ", " Transmodify ",  " Witch of the Black Forest ", " Vampire Dragon ", " Resonator Engine ", " Soul Rope ", " Summoner Monk ", " Dragunity Corsesca ", " Rescue Ferret ", " Snake Whistle ", " Damage = Reptile ", " King of the Feral Imps ", " Mysterious Triangle ", " Flying Saucer Muusik'i ", " Crop Circles ", " "A" Cell Recombination Device " and " Shark Cruiser ". 
 " Alien Dog " can be Special Summoned in response to this card's Normal Summon, and spread  A-Counters  on opposing monsters so that this card can destroy them and gain an extra attack.
 It can only gain one extra attack per turn - even if the second monster it destroys has an A-Counter(s), it will not be able to make any more attacks. 
 "Alien Dog's" effect also enables the summon of " Alien Overlord " while losing at most one A-Counter (from the two placed by "Alien Dog"). "Alien Overlord", crucially, also has the Damage Step effect involving A-Counters, allowing this card to attack and destroy monsters with more ATK than it, provided that the difference is no greater than 300 times the number of A-Counters the opposing monster has.
