       T-Bone's Linework.     
 T-Bone , known in Japan as  Iwamaru  (岩丸) is one of the four members of the  Light Brigade . He first appeared when called upon  Frost  (alongside his partner  Blaze ) after Frost defeated  Syrus Truesdale  and  Tyranno Hassleberry ; Frost intended to use them to drag their unconscious bodies to  Kaiba Land  to lure Jaden (then Duel him), but Sarina, unimpressed with the close-call nature of Frost's victory, sealed him away in a mirror. Intimidated by Sarina, Blaze and T-Bone left the lair to confront their target:  Jaden Yuki . After befriending Jaden and his friends (not knowing their names), Sarina sealed Blaze in a mirror and coerced T-Bone to duel Jaden. Despite having the powers of all the other Light Brigade members bestowed into his Deck, he lost.
 Following his defeat, he was sealed in a mirror by  Sarina , but was freed alongside the other  Light Brigade   Duelists  after Jaden and  Aster Phoenix  defeated her. In the English version, he is a rapper wannabe, reflected by his accent and choice of words.
 The "Iwa" portion of his name in the Japanese version is derived from the word "iwa" (岩), meaning "rock."
 
 
 Deck 
 T-Bone uses a  Rock  Deck  focused around " Guidance to Ore " and " Mine Golem ". He also uses the  Monarch   series  with " Demiurge Ema " as a contingency.
