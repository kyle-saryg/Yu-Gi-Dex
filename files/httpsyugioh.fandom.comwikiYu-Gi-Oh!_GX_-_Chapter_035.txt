 "The Winner! What's Next...?!" , known as  "Conclusion! And...!?"  in the Japanese version, is the thirty-fifth chapter of the  Yu-Gi-Oh! GX  manga . It was first printed in Japanese in the  V Jump  magazine and in English in the  Shonen Jump  magazine. Both of which were printed in  volume 5  of the  Yu-Gi-Oh! GX  graphic novels afterwards.
 
 Summary 
 Chazz Princeton  has defeated  Jaden Yuki  in the tournament finals and earned the right to face  Zane Truesdale . Jaden is initially upset over his loss, but returns to his cheerful self quite quickly, having had fun in all of the tournament's duels. He apologizes to  Winged Kuriboh  for losing.  Dr. Crowler  announces that the duel between Chazz and Zane will take place in the arena over the Academy's volcano. Many students are shocked that there's an arena at the volcano and are worried for their safety. Jaden urges Chazz to win against Zane, and Chazz promise to do so, but chides him at thinking that he needed to tell him that.
 Elsewhere,  Midori Hibiki  and  Reggie MacKenzie  arrive at the  Abandoned Dorm , where they will begin their duel. Reggie questions Midori about the origins of Jaden's " Winged Kuriboh ". She reveals that it was originally given to  Koyo Hibiki  by  Maximillion Pegasus  himself after Koyo had won a Junior Championship at an unspecified date. Reggie reveals that she herself had dueled Koyo six years earlier, and was not aware of the spirit's existence in the card. She speculates that the duel with her was what awoke it in the first place, due to the presence of  Tragoedia  dueling through Reggie. She tells Midori she'll let her experience the same pain that Koyo did, and black shadow leaks from her earring as the  Shadow Duel  begins. At the same time, Winged Kuriboh is leading Jaden towards the Abandoned Dorm.
 The duel begins, and Reggie realizes that Tragoedia has been injured simply by being in the presence of " Light and Darkness Dragon " through  David Rabb 's duel with Chazz. His consciousness is unable to communicate with her, so she is able to duel as she pleases, as part of her vow to rebel against Tragoedia. Reggie begins and  activates  " Court of Justice , which will let her  Special Summon  a  Fairy - Type  monster from her  hand  each turn if she has a  face-up   Level  1 Fairy on the  field . She  Normal Summons  the Level 1 " Divine Spirit Parmal " in  Defense Position  and then uses "Court of Justice" to Special Summon " Mighty Angel Virch ". Reggie wishes to use Midori as a sacrifice as part of her rebellion against Tragoedia.
 Midori begins her turn, but only  Sets  four cards, not Summoning any monsters. Reggie questions if it's hand mismanagement, and begins her turn. Reggie uses "Court of Justice" to Special Summon " Tethys, Goddess of Light ", but Midori activates her  face-down  " Dark Lightning ", which  negates  Midori's Special Summon,  destroying  "Tethys". Reggie attacks  directly  with "Virch", but Midori activates her face-down " Prison Flame ",  discarding  a card to destroy "Virch" and inflict damage to Reggie equal to half of "Virch's"  ATK , reducing her to 2900  Life Points . Midori simply Sets another card for her turn, and Reggie  draws  " Valhalla, Hall of the Fallen ", still very confident.
