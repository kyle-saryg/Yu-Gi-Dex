 Event Details 
 Similar to earlier events, the player must collect  Friendship Letters  to enter duels in the Tournament. These are obtained by dueling normal enemies in Duel World. In addition, dueling during the event rewards players with  Tag Coins —1 coin for every 100 points earned in a Duel, multiplied by each mode's multiplier—which can be traded for a wide variety of cards (picked at random via the event's card lottery).
 
 Normal 
 In the Normal mode, players join with Yami Yugi, each Duel requires 7 Friendship Tickets, the Tag Coin multiplier is x1, and they must clear three rounds to win.
 
 Yami Yugi's Deck 
 Skill:   Reinforcements of Dark Magic : If “Dark Magician Girl” is on your team’s side of the field, add 1 "Sage's Stone" to your partner, Yami Yugi’s hand, at the beginning of his turn. This Skill can only be used once per Duel.

 Tag Duel Mechanics 
 Players begin with 6000 Life Points. 
 Players share the same Field and Life Points but have separate hands, Decks, Extra Decks, and Skills.
 Players have knowledge of any face-down cards on their side of the Field regardless of who the original owner is. 
 Players can conduct their Battle Phases beginning on Turn 2. 
 Players and sides alternate turns; one player on team A moves, then one player on team B moves, then the other player on team A moves, then the other player on team B moves, then back to the first player on team A.
 The first player on team A has control of all cards on their side of the Field from their Draw Phase until the first player on team B ends their turn.

 Trivia 
 If a player enters this mode playing as the Paradox Brothers, only one brother appears. Likewise, that one brother performs the full  Summon chant  for Gate Guardian if the player Summons it. 
 When playing against Andrew and David, Jay's portrait appears instead of David's both before and after the duel. 
 When playing against Pegasus and Mickey, Pegasus refers to Mickey as “Sam”, the name of  Sam |the boy]] who he called upon to defeat Bandit Keith.
