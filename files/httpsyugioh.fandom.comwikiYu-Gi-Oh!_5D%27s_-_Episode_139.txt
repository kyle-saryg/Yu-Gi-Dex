 Summary 
 The three platforms 
 Team 5D's  and  Vizor  arrive at the heart of the  Divine Temple , which is a mass of  Ener-D  and wonder what to do next. Inside, they are monitored by  Z-one  and  Sherry . Z-one decides to "invite" them inside and opens a hole on the ground just below them, causing the group to plunge into darkness.
 
       The three platforms.     
 As the Duel Runners fall, Yusei spots three platforms below and switches the headlight on  Yusei Go  on. Yusei and Vizor land on one platform.  Crow  and  Akiza  land on another.  Jack  lands on the third.  Leo  and  Luna  miss the platforms, but Jack catches Leo, who grabs Luna's hand. Jack pulls them both on to his platform.
 The platforms are too far apart for everyone to regroup. Jack doesn't appear to be happy being stuck with the twins. However Vizor performs a scan using  Delta Eagle  and gets a map of the Divine Temple's internal structure on his monitor. He points out their location and shows that by following a part from each platform, each group should be taken to a different one of the three  Planetary Gears . If they don't stop those gears, the Ener-D's main gear will continue rotating and they won't be able to change it to a positive rotation. Vizor says that they don't have much time, so Yusei informs the others that they shall split-up and stop the gears.
 As Jack readies his Duel Runner, Leo and Luna look up anxiously fearing they might be left out, but Jack says that they heard Yusei and they have a mission to save the city. The twins excitedly smile and set up their  Duel Boards . Crow calls over to and says that he'll do it, but warns Yusei not to die. With that, he and Akiza leave. Leo and Luna catch onto the sides of  Phoenix Whirlwind  and Jack drives off with them. Yusei and Vizor then take off together through the remaining path.
 Elsewhere Z-one monitors the group splitting-up and says that it is as Sherry had predicted; They are coming regardless of the warning of Yusei's death. Sherry offers to stop them and make Z-one's plan to change the future work. But as she leaves, she reminds Z-one that he is to also fulfill her wish.
 
 The first Planetary Gear 
       Crow  returns " Z-ONE " to  Sherry .     
 Crow and Akiza arrive at the first gear. However, Sherry then appears before them and claims that this is as far as they go. She explains that she shall help Z-one and make sure everything is erased in accordance to his plan. However Akiza reminds Sherry again how she had once sworn revenge on  Iliaster  for killing her parents and Crow asks if Sherry thinks her parents would be pleased seeing her do this. Sherry tells them not to talk like they understand everything, but Crow then tosses the " Z-ONE " card over to her. He explains that  Elsworth  had given it to him and that it had been a Sherry's memento from  her father . Sherry admits that he is right, because everything occurred because of this card.
 Sherry reflects on the day she found her parents' murdered bodies and reminisces that her happy days were ruined since then. Remembering finding the card in  the teddy , she explains that she risked everything to find the murderers of her parents. Remembering herself interrogating someone and  Momentum Express  being  erased from history , she adds that the only source she had was erased from this world.
 Now that she has lost her only purpose, she asks Akiza and Crow what she's supposed to do now. Neither answer and Sherry explains that she has made a deal with Z-one, where by cooperating with him, he shall grant her one true wish, which she refuses to tell. Akiza asks if this wish is really worth sacrificing the lives of the people who will be crushed by the Divine Temple, but Sherry claims that her wish cannot be compared to those lives.
 
       Sherry connects her life with the  Planetary Gear .     
 Sherry says that she no longer has any use for "Z-ONE" and prepares to throw it back, but Crow stops her and says that the card is important to her, so she should be the one keeping it. Sherry questions his decision to let his opponent have such a powerful card, but Crow doesn't mind. Sherry shuffles it into her Deck and prepares to Duel.
 After a flash of white light, Sherry's life is connected to the Planetary Gear, such that Akiza and Crow must defeat her in order to stop the gear. Seeing no other way, Crow and Akiza prepare to Duel too.
 
 
 The Duel 
 Sherry goes first and  activates  the  Field Spell Card  " Ecole de Zone ", causing a mist to fill the room. Sherry explains that with it, none of the players are able to make  direct attacks . She says that Akiza and Crow will make good opponents and splits into two identical bodies. The mist gets thicker and Crow and Akiza are separated when they are no longer able to see each other.
 
         Akiza  faces Sherry in the garden.     
 The mist around Akiza clears and she finds herself in a rose garden, where she stands on the water of a pond without sinking. There are stone pillars shattered throughout, including some floating in midair. There are stairs both upside down right-side up and a peculiar eye in the sky. Sherry stands before her on the right-side up stairs.
 Elsewhere the other Sherry is facing Crow, who is in a location with old crumbling buildings. Similar to Akiza's location, he is standing on the water of a canal without sinking, an identical eye is in the sky, there is an upside down stairs and chunks of stone wall are floating in midair.
 Crow demands to know what this place is and where Akiza is. Standing up on an arch above the canal, Sherry says that this is the effect of "École de Zone". At the same time, the two Sherries say to Akiza and Crow that they are each on a different field, where they will fight her.
 The Sherry with Akiza ends her turn, causing the location to rotate. The staircase Sherry is standing on now appears upside down to Akiza. Seeing no option, but to fight, Akiza begins her turn and Summons " Twilight Rose Knight ". To her surprise, "Twilight Rose Knight" is  destroyed  and replaced with a  Token  with 1000  ATK . She asks about the Field Spell's effect and ends her turn.
 
         Crow faces upside down Sherry at the canal.     
 The Sherry facing Crow Summons " Mask Token " with 1000 ATK. She ends her turn and the field rotates so that she appears upside down to Crow. Crow accuses her of using a weird magic, but vows to break it. He begins his turn and his opening hand contains " Blackwing - Hurricane the Tornado ", " Level Wing ", " Chaos Life ", " Down Force ", " Blackwing - Kochi the Daybreak " and " Blackwing - Bora the Spear ". He plans on Summoning "Kochi" allowing him to Summon "Bora" as he will control a " Blackwing " monster. He Summons "Kochi", but before he can  Special Summon  "Bora", "Kochi" is replaced with a "Mask Token" with 700 ATK. Crow realizes that it is the same as the monster Sherry just Summoned and becomes disappointed about being unable to Summon "Bora", as the Token is not a "Blackwing" monster. Crow  Sets  a card in his  Spell & Trap Card Zone  and ends his turn. This causes the scenery to move around again. 
 In the garden, the scenery is also moved around and Sherry is now facing Akiza from the top of a tower. She Summons a "Mask Token" with 700 ATK. She then Sets a card in the Spell & Trap Card Zone and ends her turn. The floating eye watches Akiza as she draws her next card and blinks. Akiza notes that Sherry is after Summoning the same Token, but with a different ATK. Akiza  Releases  her "Mask Token" to Summon " Rose Tentacles ". As she suspected, "Rose Tentacles" is replaced with a larger "Mask Token" with 2200 ATK. Akiza  attacks  Sherry's "Mask Token" with her own, destroying it and dropping "Sherry"'s  Life Points  to 2500. Akiza ends her turn.
 At the canal, "Sherry" begins her turn. She Releases her "Mask Token" to Summon a 2200 ATK "Mask Token" and attacks Crow's 700 ATK "Mask Token", destroying it and dropping Crow's Life Points to 2500. She ends her turn and the scenery moves around again. Crow notes that Sherry is only Summoning these Tokens and in this field anything Summoned is changed to a Token. At this rate, he won't be able to  Synchro Summon  or use the power of his "Blackwing" monsters, he worries. However he draws " Blackwing - Kogarashi the Wanderer " and gets an idea.
 Crow Summons "Bora", which is replaced with a Token. However, since "Bora" was destroyed, Crow is able to Special Summon "Kogarashi" from his hand, and its effect prevents it from being destroyed. Hence it is not replaced with a "Mask Token". He comments that if Sherry thought that she could seal his "Blackwing" monsters that easily she was wrong. The eye blinks and Sherry activates " Fleur de Vertiges " to  remove  "Kogarashi" from play. However Crow  chains  "Down Force" to  negate  the effect of "Fleur de Vertiges" and destroy it. Following that, Crow attacks "Sherry"'s Mask Token with "Kogarashi". However, Sherry activates " High Half " to halve the ATK of her "Mask Token". "Kogarashi" destroys the Token, dropping Sherry's Life Points to 2800.
 Crow is stunned and wonders why Sherry tried removing his monster and then went on to just weaken her own monster. He looks up at the eye and something suddenly jumps to mind. He thinks there can only be one explanation for what's going on. Confident he knows the truth of the situation, he worries about Akiza and begs for her to realize what is going on. With that, he ends his turn.
 
         Akiza wonders why Sherry has a " Blackwing ".     
 In the rose garden, Akiza is panting, having just lost Life Points, leaving her at 2800. She looks up and sees "Blackwing - Kogarashi the Wanderer" on "Sherry"'s side of the field. She asks why Sherry has a "Blackwing", but Sherry just smiles.
 In the mist-filled room that appeared when Sherry initially played "École de Zone", Sherry stands and comments that even if Crow and Akiza have realized it, there's no escape for them. She activates " Imitation ", which lets her select one Token on the field and Special Summon a "Mask Token" copy of it to her opponent's side of the field and inflict damage to them, equal to half its ATK. In the garden, a "Mask Token" with 1700 is Summoned next to Akiza and slaps her, dropping her Life Points to 1950.
 Akiza, who didn't see Sherry playing "Imitation" wonders why that just happened. She remembers the same thing happening when her Token had its ATK halved when it was attacked by "Kogarashi" and wonders if it came from another Duel. After looking at the "Blackwing" monster and remembers Sherry splitting in two, Akiza realizes what's going on and calls Sherry a liar. The Sherry in the original room sees that Akiza has realized something, but is still confident that there is no escape for her.
 Akiza says that Sherry has underestimated the bonds of  Team 5D's , as "Kogarashi" has another effect. Although "Kogarashi" is her opponent's monster, Akiza is able to tune it with her monster for a  Synchro Summon . Akiza Synchro Summons " Black Rose Dragon ", and the effect of "Kogarashi" prevents "Black Rose Dragon" from being destroyed. Hence preventing it being replaced with a Token. Akiza proceeds to use its effect, "Black Rose Gale", to destroy every card on the field.
 With "École de Zone" destroyed, the garden and canal locations are destroyed. Akiza and Crow find themselves standing next to each other in the original room across from Sherry. Crow says that Sherry is not smart enough and he and Akiza explain what just happened; Sherry led them to believe that they were facing her on different fields, but the three were in fact participating in a  Battle Royal  and as Akiza and Crow attacked what they believed to be Sherry, they were really attacking each other.
 
         Team 5D's  learn how to use each other's Decks.     
 Crow accuses Sherry of using cowardly tricks, but she compliments them on figuring it out. Crow states that he was confident Akiza would solve it. Akiza nods and explains that it was thanks to Yusei. She reflects on a Team 5D's meeting, where Yusei got himself, Akiza, Jack and Crow to learn how each other's Decks work in order to fight as a team.
 Sherry laughs and again compliments them on figuring out her trick, but insists that they are pitiful if they think that they have the upper hand. She reveals that her card " Z-ONE " had been  face-down  when "Black Rose Dragon" destroyed everything. Since it was destroyed, she can use its effect. Holding the card over her head, she declares that the card her father left her will lead them into oblivion.
 
 
 Featured Duel: Akiza Izinski and Crow Hogan vs. Sherry LeBlanc 
         Sherry VS Crow and Akiza.     
 After  Sherry  plays " Ecole de Zone " so that  Crow  and  Akiza  percieve that they are each dueling Sherry separately. However, the three of them are participating a  Battle Royal , where Akiza and Crow are dueling each other, and an illusion causes them to see each other as Sherry.
 During the episode the Duel is shown from the perspectives of Akiza and Crow as they duel thinking the other is Sherry.
 Turn 1: Sherry LeBlanc 
Sherry draws " Ecole de Zone " and subsequently activates it. Now both players can't attack directly and if a non-Token Monster is summoned, the summon of that monster will be negated and the summoned monster will be destroyed. After that is done, a  Mask Token  will be summoned to the destroyed monster's controller's side of the field. The ATK and DEF of the summoned Mask Token will then become the same as the ATK and DEF of the destroyed monster.
 Turn 2: Akiza Izinski 
Akiza draws " Twilight Rose Knight " and subsequently Normal Summons it ( 3/1000/1000) in Attack Position. "Ecole de Zone" then negates the summon, destroys "Twilight Rose Knight" and Special Summons a " Mask Token " with the same ATK and DEF as "Twilight Rose Knight" ( 1/? → 1000/? → 1000) in Attack Position.
 
 Crow sees this turn as Sherry Normal Summoning a " Mask Token " (1000/1000) in Attack Position. 
 Turn 3: Crow Hogan 
Crow draws " Blackwing - Bora the Spear ". Crow's hand contains " Blackwing - Hurricane the Tornado ", " Level Wing ", " Chaos Life ", "Down Force", " Blackwing - Kochi the Daybreak " and " Blackwing - Bora the Spear ". Crow  Normal Summons  "Blackwing - Kochi the Daybreak" ( 4/700/1500) in Attack Position. Crow is about to Special Summon "Bora the Spear" via its own effect, but "Ecole de Zone" negates the summon, destroys "Kochi the Daybreak" and Special Summons a " Mask Token " with the same ATK and DEF as "Kochi the Daybreak" ( 1/? → 700/? → 1500) in Attack Position. Crow  Sets  a card.
 
 Akiza sees this turn as Sherry Normal Summoning a "Mask Token" (700/1500) in Attack Position and Setting a card. 
 Turn 4: Sherry LeBlanc 
Sherry draws. She then Sets three cards ("Fleur de Vertiges", " Z-ONE " and "High Half").
 
 Neither Crow nor Akiza see this turn. These cards may have been Set on her first turn as well. 
 Turn 5: Akiza Izinski 
Akiza draws. She then Tributes her "Mask Token" in order to  Tribute Summon  " Rose Tentacles " ( 6/2200/1200) in Attack Position. "Ecole de Zone" then negates the summon, destroys "Rose Tentacles" and Special Summons a "Mask Token" with the same ATK and DEF as "Rose Tentacles" ( 1/? → 2200/? → 1200) in Attack Position. Akiza's "Mask Token" attacks and destroys Crow's "Mask Token" (Crow 4000 → 2500).
 
 Crow sees this turn as Sherry Tributing a "Mask Token" in order to Tribute Summon another Mask Token (2200/1200) in Attack Position and using it to attack and destroy his Token. 
 Turn 6: Crow Hogan 
Crow draws "Blackwing - Kogarashi the Wanderer". He then  Normal Summons  "Blackwing - Bora the Spear" ( 4/1700/800) in Attack Position. "Ecole de Zone" then negates the summon, destroys "Bora the Spear" and Special Summons a "Mask Token" with the same ATK and DEF as "Bora the Spear" ( 1/? → 1700/? → 800) in Attack Position. 
 Since a monster Crow controls was destroyed and sent to the Graveyard, Crow Special Summons " Blackwing - Kogarashi the Wanderer " ( 6/2300/1600) in Attack Position. Due to the first effect of "Kogarashi the Wanderer", "Ecole de Zone" can't negate its summon. Sherry activates her face-down " Fleur de Vertiges " to remove "Kogarashi the Wanderer" from play, but Crow activates his face-down " Down Force " to negate "Fleur de Vertiges" and destroy it. "Kogarashi the Wanderer" attacks Akiza's Mask Token, but  Sherry  activates her face-down " High Half " to halve the ATK of Akiza's "Mask Token" (Akiza's Mask Token: 2200 → 1100/1200). "Kogarashi the Wanderer" then destroys Akiza's Mask Token (Akiza 4000 → 2800).
 
 Akiza sees this turn as Sherry Normal Summoning a "Mask Token" (1700/800) in Attack Position and then Special Summoning "Blackwing - Kogarashi the Wanderer" (2300/1600) in Attack Position. She sees "Kogarashi" attacking her Token and her Token's ATK mysteriously getting its ATK halved before "Kogarashi" destroys it. 
 Turn 7: Sherry LeBlanc 
Sherry draws. She then activates " Imitation " to target Crow's "Mask Token" and Special Summon a "Mask Token" to Akiza's side of field with the same original Level, Type, Attribute, ATK, and DEF as the selected Token ( 1/? → 1700/? → 800) in Attack Position as well as inflict damage to Akiza equal to half the Token's ATK (Akiza 2800 → 1950).
 
 Akiza sees this turn as a "Mask Token" (1700/800) mysteriously getting summoned onto her side of the field in Attack Position and taking damage through unknown means. 
 Turn 8: Akiza Izinski 
Akiza draws " Crystal Veil ". She then uses the second effect of Crow's "Blackwing - Kogarashi the Wanderer" to tune her Mask Token with "Kogarashi the Wanderer" in order to  Synchro Summon  " Black Rose Dragon " ( 7/2400/1800) in Attack Position. Since "Black Rose Dragon used "Kogarashi the Wanderer" as a Synchro Material Monster for its Synchro Summon, "Ecole de Zone" can't negate the summon of "Black Rose Dragon". Akiza then activates the effect of "Black Rose Dragon" to destroy all cards on the field.
 
 Crow sees this as Sherry Synchro Summoning "Black Rose Dragon" (2400/1800) in Attack Position and using its effect to destroy all cards on the field. 
 Once "Ecole de Zone" is destroyed, the illusion that it was creating is broken. Since "Z-ONE" was destroyed and sent to the Graveyard while it was on the field, Sherry activates its effect.
