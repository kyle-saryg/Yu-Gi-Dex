On his custom-built Duel Runner, Yusei takes on all challengers, fighting for his friends and the future of Satellite! [1] 
 The Way to the King of Sky's Lock!! 
 Goodwin's plan to revive the Ultimate God moves forward as he sets up a match between Akiza and Sect that mirrors a fateful duel five thousand years ago! Yusei has gathered all the Star Tickets and entered the Duel Gate. Even if he can find his friend Sect, he still has to get past the Skeleton Knight, and if he does, will he have the strength to face the Ultimate God? [2] 
 
 Story 
 New Domino City, in the year 20XX, Turbo Duels, fought from the seats of motorcycled-shaped duel disks called "Duel Runners," are the hottest game in town. 
 Yusei Fudo, the toughest Duelist in Satellite, suffered a painful loss to Jack Atlas. In order to duel Jack again, Yusei entered the D1 Grand Prix, the battle to determine the strongest duelist in the world!! As the strongmen of the dueling world slugged it out, Yusei fought his way into the second round, where he beat, Crow, Leo and Luna, and won his own Duel Dragon, Stardust Spark Dragon! Blasting through the Duel Gate, he headed for Aerial Fortress Seibal where Sect was waiting for him, and where a ritual to resurrect the ultimate god was about to take place!! [2] 
 
 In the Next Volume… 
 The duel between Jack Atlas and Rex Goodwin comes to a surprising end, While the duelists from the Grand Prix try to figure out what happened to them, Yusei battles the Skeleton Knight in an amazing running duel. A vision of the past just might give him the edge he needs to win, but what other secrets will it reveal?
