For the card, see:  Penalty Game! 
 A  Penalty Game  is a punishment given to someone who either loses or cheats in a  Shadow Game .  Millennium Item  holders are capable of inflicting supernatural punishments.
 Penalty Games played an important part in early  Yu-Gi-Oh!  storylines, but are used much less frequently when the main character, Yugi Mutou, decides to stop using them, being exclusively used by villains. The  first series anime  toned down the fatality of a number of Penalty Games, making some merely illusions.

 Dark Yugi 
 Dark Yugi 's ( Yami Yugi 's) Penalty Games often act as poetic justice to a person who trespassed on the souls of his friends, and for their history of committing crimes and evils onto others. While some of these penalties are fatal, he has used them to help the person at times; The  Mind Crush  Penalty Game was used to shatter  Seto Kaiba 's tainted heart, so he could be given a chance to piece it together in order to become a good person again. While Penalty Games used illusions and magic on the loser's psyche and soul, some of the dangerous games played would merely boast devastating losses on their own even without the need of such powers. Not all the penalty games make use of the Millenium Puzzle's powers; a number of the punishments are mundane results of the circumstances of the game being played. 
 In the  NAS anime , Mind Crush is the only Penalty Game shown to be used. Aside from sealing away Kaiba's evil side (instead of shattering his heart into fragments and turning it into a puzzle like in the manga), it has also been used to kill  Ghost Kaiba  (a shape-shifter that was hired by  Maximillion Pegasus  as a Player Killer),  PaniK  (Player Killer of Darkness in the original) and rendered a mugger (stalker/pervert in the original) unconscious (the game in which the mugger/stalker lost was to draw a card, and whichever card is the strongest wins). In the Japanese version, these three victims disappear off the land or be in a state of unconsciousness, or in the dub, banished to the Shadow Realm. During this time, Dark Yugi wasn't that different from Dark Bakura or Dark Marik, aside from the fact that he used his shadow magic to defend the honor of his friends and wasn't just banishing people for fun or to gain power. The Mind Crush has not been used since PaniK, or seen since the flashback with the mugger, with no real explanation in the anime whereas an explanation was present in the manga. In anime terms, this is probably because Dark Yugi was beginning to learn compassion and kindness from Yugi and started learning how to beat his enemies without intimidating them with the use of Shadow Games and Penalty Games. So, theoretically, if people like Dark Bakura and Dark Marik had a similar relationship that Dark Yugi had with Yugi, they too would go through that kind of epiphany. 
 In the manga, a variety of different Penalty Games were used during  Duelist Kingdom  not unlike the previous chapters. Unlike the anime in which no explanation is given, Dark Yugi decides to stop using them after the defeat of  Pegasus , because it would have proven that the Millennium Items indeed had an evil will.  [1] 
 Three of Dark Yugi's Penalty Games have cards based on them, which were released in  Soul of the Duelist . These are " Greed ", " Mind Crush " and " Mind on Air ".

 Mind on Air
 
 Yugi used it to reveal the  ZTV producer 's inner greed, making him go raving mad on-air and order his "lazy working-class couch potato" audience to send him money. Done when Yugi discovers that the station the producer worked for had a history of conning contestants of their dignity by manipulating the odds of winning the final game, all as a way of boosting profits. While the punishment succeeded in exposing the producer's depravity, it bankrupted the company, ruining Jonouchi's chance to win the money he needed to pay off his father's debts.
 
 
 
 
 Face Collapse
 
 During Yugi's Shadow Game of  Monster Fighter  with  Koji Nagumo , both players acted as scapegoats for their fighters; feeling the blows given to their figures and taking damage instead of them. Upon Nagumo's third attempt to cheat by kicking his competition in the ribs, the Shadow Game's effect intensified, animating his stolen fighters to hold down his kicking leg. This included his  Wild Spider  figurine, which became sickened by his master's cheating and abandoned him. The game manifested in its place a fitting monster based off of Nagumo's twisted desires, which Yugi finished off by using  Killer Emaada 's Space Cannon punch technique. Done as punishment for Nagumo cheating his classmates in  Monster Fighter , then taking their figures and reselling them at inflated prices. Despite the seeming fatality, Nagumo survived and later awakened to participate in  Battle City .
 
 
 
 
 Xing Zhen Xu
 
 Imori  unsealed the forbidden feng shui game,  Dragon Cards  ( Dragon Block  in the anime– a mahjong game with the same rules), whose ravenous dragon spirits demanded the loser's soul as sustenance, else the land which they were unsealed would suffer eternal disaster and misfortune. Upon the last game with Dark Yugi, Imori lost and his soul was consumed as punishment for unsealing the evil game and desiring to usurp Yugi's position as the Guardian of Darkness for his own ends. This game was not devised by Yami Yugi, a detail he acknowledges in the manga, but was merely a casualty of losing the game.
 In the anime,  Imori 's soul was spared; instead his dark side, unleashed by the  Dragon Block , was consumed and destroyed by the dragons. Also, each player had to set a "base" in the real world, which suffered an earthquake when they lost. Yugi's shadow games saw Imori placing his "base" in the ocean, so there was no damage afterwards. [17]

 Following his brief rose-picking game with  Kaoruko Himekoji , Dark Yugi causes the remaining flower in Himekoji's hand to wither. Upon noticing the flower, Himekoji sees her skin has become wrinkly–her ultimate fear. Upon examining her reflection in the mirror, she sees that she has become wrinkled and aged. Snakes wrap around her wrists to entangle her as Dark Yugi leaves. In reality, Himekoji is merely hypnotized, and the "snakes" are actually ropes tied to buckets of water, which she dumps on herself in front of the whole school. [18]  Done as punishment for assaulting  Miho Nosaka  in order to win the school beauty contest.

 After winning both of his pendulum-clock-stop games against the watch-obsessed  Shotaro Akaboshi , Yami Yugi inflicts this grisly punishment. Looking into the open wound inflicted by the pendulum, Shotaro is made to believe that clock parts are inside of his arm, and rolls down his sleeves to reveal that his body is fused with his beloved Swiss watches. As he pleads for help, his eyes are revealed to now be clock faces. All of this is an illusion, and in reality Shotaro returns home to mindlessly destroy his watch collection in silence.  [19]  Done as punishment for stealing Miho's D-Shock watch, and his general brash immaturity.
 
 
 
 
 Unnamed
 
 After losing to Dark Yugi in a  Digital Pet  battle,  Haiyama  whipped  his Digital Pet , commanding it to get up. Haiyama's pet would soon get up and turn against him, before proceeding to eat him.

 Unnamed
 
 The  Continuous Bomber  was made to believe that a ticking time bomb had been placed inside the gondola he was hiding in, causing him to panic and jump out of his hiding spot.  [21]  Done as punishment for threatening  Anzu 's life and for terrorizing  Domino City  with bombs.
 
 
 
 
 Unnamed
 
 Dr. Goyu  was bombarded by illusions of zombies, who were the patients who had died under his care due to his negligence. He would later confess to his actions while laughing maniacally.  [22]  Done as punishment for neglecting his patients in favor of golf, firing  Miyuki Sakurai  after he had been called out by her, and for blackmailing  Jonouchi  by threatening to kick  Shizuka  out of the hospital if he dared to expose the doctor's wrongdoings to the public.
 
 
 
 
 Puppet Illusion
 
 Dark Yugi used this during  Duelist Kingdom  to make the  Ventriloquist of the Dead  believe he was being attacked by a demonic puppet modeled after himself. Done as punishment for stealing Kaiba's deck and "toying his soul" with his  caricature puppet . In the English anime, Dark Yugi used a Mind Crush against  Ghost Kaiba  and in the Japanese anime erases the man off the face of the earth.
 
 
 
 
 Darkness of Naraku
 
 The  Player Killer of Darkness , imagined himself being hung from the gallows and falling into a dark abyss. Done as punishment for attacking Duelists in the dead of night out of cowardice. During the Duel, Dark Yugi showed the Player Killer illusions of the impending Penalty Game, in which the Player Killer was walking up the gallows' stairs each turn closer to the five turn limit Dark Yugi claimed that he would win within. In the anime, Dark Yugi simply used a Mind Crush against  PaniK .
 
 
 
 Shadi 
 Shadi  uses Penalty Games to punish people who disturb the territory of the gods.  Curator Kanekura  was one of Shadi's victims after he defiled an Egyptian tomb. In the anime, Kanekura had tried to sell the  Millennium Puzzle .  Ammit  was let into Kankura's soul room to pass judgment. In the manga this caused Kankura to die. In the anime, he wakes up and screams one time.  Professor Yoshimori  is spared of a Shadow and Penalty Game, as Shadi uses him for a Shadow Game against Yugi.

 Ammit Nesting in "Soul Room"
 
 Curator Kanekura  imagined his chair transformed into  Ammit , during  his Shadow Game . After losing  Shadi  told him that Ammit was inside his  soul room  devouring his soul. In reality, Kanekura died of a heart attack. [23] 
 
 
 
 Dark Bakura 
 Dark Bakura's ( Yami Bakura 's) Penalty Games at the beginning of the manga turn the victims into figurines to use in  Monster World . During  Battle City , he kills "Ghost" Kotsuzuka ( Bonz ) after beating him in  Duel Monsters . In the English  second series anime , he instead sends Bonz to the  Shadow Realm  (In the Japanese version, he sent him to Hell).

 Mind Doll
 
 Dark Bakura transfers the soul of the victim into their corresponding figurine in the  Monster World   game, whenever they roll a fumble (99), whenever he rolls a super-critical (00) or break a rule. He also used it against the gym teacher  Mr. Karita , who had harassed  Ryo Bakura .
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Dark Bakura in the  NAS anime  used this after he defeated "Ghost" Kotsuzuka ( Bonz ). He summoned  Earthbound Spirits  to pull "Ghost" Kotsuzuka, alongside with his friends  Takaido  and  Satake  with them to Hell.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Dark Bakura in the  manga  used an unnamed Penalty Game on  Ghost Kozuka  after defeating him, which "took his life", causing Kozuka to drop dead onto the ground.
 
 
 
 Pegasus 
 Maximillion J. Pegasus  uses Penalty Games for personal gain, often trapping the souls of the victims in the " Soul Prison " card. He trapped  Sugoroku Mutou 's soul into a video tape (Soul Prison card in the anime) after beating Yugi, to force Yugi into entering  Duelist Kingdom . He also trapped  Mokuba Kaiba 's in a card and later Seto Kaiba's after beating him in a Duel. In the manga, after  Jonouchi  beat  Bandit Keith  in a Duel, Pegasus forced Keith to shoot himself in the head for cheating. In the anime, there's an inconsistency where Pegasus is shown giving a Penalty Game to Mokuba without playing a game with him.

 SOUL TV
 
 Pegasus sucked the soul of  Sugoroku Mutou  into a TV. His soul became sealed in  a videotape , allowing Yugi to communicate with him through other devices he could put the tape in. In the anime, after being sucked into the TV, his soul was sent to a " Soul Prison ", as done in the Mind Card Penalty Game.
 
 
 
 
 Mind Card
 
 Pegasus casts the "Mind Card" Penalty Game onto victims of those who lose a Duel against him; this seals his victims' souls into a card, " Soul Prison ". Pegasus used it on  Mokuba  in part of his plan to capture  KaibaCorp , and then against  Seto Kaiba  for losing against him.  Glory of the King's Opposite Hand  that he gave to Yugi is intended to trap Yugi's soul into the card should Pegasus win the duel. However, when Yugi won, Pegasus released the three imprisoned souls, as promised.
 Yako Tenma  also used the "Soul Prison" to imprison  Anzu Mazaki 's soul to further his  Project R.A. .
 
 
 
 
 
 Hand and Gun
 
 In the manga, after confronting Keith for cheating in the Duel against Jonouchi in the semifinals, and showing neither remorse nor regret for his transgression, Pegasus declared that Keith had lost his mind as a Duelist and inflicted a Penalty Game on him, making Keith see that his right hand has a gun barrel imbedded into it, and said hand moved on its own to "shoot" Keith in the temple, Russian Roulette style, thus killing him instantly. However, Keith was later revived by  Yako Tenma .
 
 
 
 Dark Marik 
 Dark Marik  punished losers of Duels against him with Penalty Games. He played two types of Shadow Games of  Duel Monsters , one of which would cause participants to suffer real pain, as they and their monsters took damage, and the other which would cause parts of the players' bodies to disappear as they lost Life Points. Under normal circumstances, the loser would die from pain or their body disappearing. Mai Kujaku survived because of Dark Yugi shielding her from an attack. So Dark Marik inflicted the "Mind-Eroding Insects" Penalty Game on her instead. Jonouchi survived, having not lost all his Life Points, but Dark Marik erroneously pronounced him dead from the injuries he suffered.

 Brain Insects
 
 After defeating Mai, Dark Marik trapped her soul inside an hourglass, with  The Winged Dragon of Ra  card blocking the neck of it, blocking the contents of the upper portion until Marik removed it.
 In the manga, the upper portion of the hourglass was filled with "brain insects" that would completely devour Mai's  soft tissue  over 24 hours, killing her. The hourglass was also shown to be floating in a sort of limbo with various casino gambling devices floating around it, reflecting Mai's previous occupation as a casino dealer.
 In the anime, Mai's punishment in the hourglass follows the same general outline, but undergoes several major changes; the insects are replaced with sand, and her time to live is extended. In addition, the hourglass is floating above a beach where Mai's friends are enjoying themselves — and seemingly forgetting her — as part of Marik's ploy to add insult to injury. The English dub also states the hourglass exists in the Shadow Realm.
 After  Yami Yugi  defeats Dark Marik in the finals, Mai was saved just before her mind was consumed. In the anime, Mai was traumatized by her time in the Penalty Game, and it took  many trials  for her to find herself anew.
 
 
 
 
 
 Darkness Prey
 
 Dark Bakura  became consumed by darkness after losing to Dark Marik. This was set up so that over the course of the duel, parts of the players' bodies would fade into darkness as Life Points were lost. This Shadow Game later appeared in the  Yu-Gi-Oh! GX  two part episode " The Shad ow Duelist ", which also revealed the cause behind  Jaden Yuki  & the  Shadow Rider   Titan 's body parts throughout the duel, those being an armada of small shadow creatures.
 
 
 
 
 Phoenix Dance
 
 Katsuya Jonouchi  collapsed from fatigue after being struck by  Egyptian God Phoenix , an attack which dealt real damage to him. Dark Marik erroneously pronounced him dead afterwards.

 Experience of Death 
 
 Seto Kaiba recreated the "Experience of Death" Penalty Game, that Dark Yugi subjected him to, using virtual reality. Using a  Battle Box , he created holographic images of monsters to attack the victim. He claims to have tested this on human subjects and found that the average person went insane after being subjected to this for ten minutes. He inflicted this penalty on  Sugoroku Mutou  after beating him in  Duel Monsters . He forced  Yugi  to participate in  Death-T , before releasing Sugoroku. After Mokuba's loss to Dark Yugi at  Death T-4 , he was subjected to the same punishment, before being saved by Dark Yugi.
 
 
 
 Kyoji Yagumo
