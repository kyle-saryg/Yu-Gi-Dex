 Lyrics (TV size) 
 Kanji Rōmaji English 
 
 ダメじゃない 涙を隠すピエロ 気持ちに嘘をついた僕 
 
黒星だらけの日々 挫けそうになる度 笑って誤魔化してた 
諦めきれないのは 未来の図があるから 賽はもう投げられた 
葛藤 何を描くの？ ずっと 一人きりで描いたビジョン 
 
ダメじゃない 過ちは繰り返さない 不可能など言い訳だろう 
嘘じゃない あなたの笑顔こそが 僕に何度だって力くれるよ 
 
僕にとってのビジョンはあなた
 
 
 
 Dame janai namida wo kakusu piero kimochi ni uso wo tsuita boku 
 
Kuroboshi darake no hibi kujikesō ni naru tabi waratte gomakashiteta 
Akiramekirenai no wa mirai no zu ga aru kara sai wa mō nagerareta 
Kattō nani wo egaku no? Zutto hitori-kiri de egaita bijon 
 
Dame janai ayamachi wa kurikaesanai fukanō nado iiwake darō 
Uso janai anata no egao koso ga boku ni nando datte chikara kureru yo 
 
Boku ni totte no bijon wa anata
 
 
 
 It's no good. I feel like I'm lying, like a pierrot who hides his tears. 
 
Those days full of failure... No matter how much I felt discouraged, I'd fake a laugh. 
I couldn't stop giving up because the future was already drawn; the die was already rolled. 
I feel conflicted; what did I want to draw? I've spent so long drawing out my vision. 
 
It's no good. I won't repeat the same mistakes again. "Impossible" is just an excuse. 
It's not a lie. Your smile is what gave me strength so many times. 
 
For me, you are my vision.
