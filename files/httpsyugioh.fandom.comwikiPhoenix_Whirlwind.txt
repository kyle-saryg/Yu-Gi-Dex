 Jack Atlas 
 
 Phoenix Whirlwind , known as  Wheel of Fortune  and later  Volcanic Wheel of Fortune  in the Japanese version, is  Jack Atlas '  Duel Runner . It has the design of a monowheel and a detachable  Duel Disk  that can be used for regular ground Duels. Other than  Turbo Dueling , Jack makes use of the  Phoenix Whirlwind  as a means of transportation.
 In the  manga ,  Rex Goodwin  owns  his own version  of  Phoenix Whirlwind , with a darker color scheme.
 
 History 
 Jack stole  the first Duel Runner  built by  Yusei Fudo  and used it to venture into  New Domino City . It got ruined in an accident and Jack later acquired the  Wheel of Fortune . (In the dub, both Duel Runners were said to be the same.)
 
       Phoenix Whirlwind , upgraded for the  WRGP .     
 During the  Fortune Cup , the  Wheel of Fortune  got damaged after Yusei and Jack's  Turbo Duel . Later, under Rex Goodwin's orders, it got repaired and was given modifications. Jack suspected that this occurred due to Goodwin's fears concerning the power of the  Dark Signers ' Duel Runners.
 In the dub, the name  Phoenix Whirlwind  is explained in two parts. The word " phoenix " comes from the mythical creature that was reborn from its ashes, in a similar manner to Jack's Duel Runner, which was repaired and improved after crashing. The word "whirlwind" symbolizes Jack's ambition to "blow" his opponents away. [1] 
 Before the  World Racing Grand Prix , Jack got the  Phoenix Whirlwind  upgraded giving it a slight visual change. Using  Ener-D  rotary, its acceleration was increased by 150%. It had the program Yusei and Bruno developed installed and was given some new parts. With the upgrade the Duel Runner was renamed  Volcanic Wheel of Fortune . [2] 
 
       Jack's  Phoenix Whirlwind is covered in crimson light.     
 The Phoenix Whirlwind (type-FSC) HOF-01/R used by  Jack  in  Yu-Gi-Oh! ARC-V  is similar to the one used on the  World Racing Grand Prix . The only difference is the Team 5D's logo missing, instead the letter A appears on front. [3]  This version of the Phoenix Whirlwind is also capable of riding at incredible speeds which can greatly ascend it.
