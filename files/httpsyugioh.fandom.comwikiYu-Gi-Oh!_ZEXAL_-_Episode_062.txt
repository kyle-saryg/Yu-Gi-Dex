However, in order to return Shark to normal, Yuma Summons " Number 39: Utopia " and takes  control  of the dangerous "Shark Drake Veiss". But when the " Chaos Number " tries to take control of him instead, Shark ends the Duel by depleting his own  Life Points  in order to save his friend and defy  Vetrix 's influence.

 Summary 
 As  Shark  brings out " Number 32: Shark Drake " and the card's purple aura surrounds him, the audience is confused as to what a " Number " is.  Flip  says it looks quite strong and  Tori  whispers  Yuma 's name.  Mr. Heartland  says it looks like quite a fearsome monster, while  Dr. Faker , watching from his room, calls it incredible, adding that he must get his hands on that card. Shark orders "Shark Drake" to  attack  " Gogogo Ghost " with " Depth Bite ". As his  monster  is  destroyed , Yuma is thrown off his feet and his  Life Points  are reduced to 900.  Astral  warns Yuma that another attack is coming and Yuma says he knows as he attempts to get up. Shark  activates  the  effect  of "Shark Drake",  detaching  an  Overlay Unit  to  Special Summon  the destroyed "Gogogo Ghost" from Yuma's  Graveyard , with its  ATK  reduced by 1000. A Summoning portal appears and "Shark Drake" blasts a stream of water into it, carrying "Gogogo Ghost" out of it, with its ATK at 900. 
 
       " Gogogo Ghost " defends  Yuma .     
 Bronk  asks why Shark would bring back Yuma's monster and Tori says it's so he can attack it again. Shark says Yuma has only 900 Life Points left; if he attacks, he's finished. He orders "Shark Drake" to bite both "Gogogo Ghost" and Yuma to pieces. Yuma's friends are horrified, but as the smoke clears, Yuma's Life Points remain at 900 and " Gogogo Golem " is on his  field  in  Defense Position . Everyone appears confused, but Flip says he must have swapped monsters. Yuma explains that when "Gogogo Ghost" is Special Summoned, it can Special Summon "Gogogo Golem" from his Graveyard in Defense Position, with "Gogogo Ghost" also switching to Defense Position. Therefore, "Gogogo Ghost" was still destroyed, but Yuma lost no Life Points. Shark calls Yuma's play a desperate struggle and ends his  turn .
 
         Dr. Faker  watches the  Duel .     
 Bronk says that was amazing and  Caswell  compliments Yuma's great tactics. Flip suggests it must have been Astral's doing, which enrages  Cathy . She says Yuma is the one fighting and scratches Flip with her cat claws again, causing him to cry in pain (this scene is cut from the dub). Tori urges Yuma to do his best. From his private box,  Vetrix  thinks Yuma did well. Faker says that a "Number" can only be destroyed by another "Number", so Yuma has no choice but to Summon his own "Number", which Faker describes as "the partition of  the original ". Astral tells Yuma to Summon " Number 39: Utopia ", believing there is no other way to win. Yuma says he knows that, but he has only "Gogogo Golem" out. He must  draw  another  Level  4 monster. He draws a  Trap Card , " Power Change Barrier ". Astral tells him not to panic, but Yuma responds that he can't help it - he must save Shark as soon as possible to prevent Vetrix from claiming another victim. He tells Shark to wake up and to remember their previous Duels. Shark asks what he means and Yuma mentions  their first Duel , where he gambled his own and Bronk's Decks as well as  their Tag Duel . Scenes from both Duels are shown as well as Shark's compliment to Yuma after their Tag Duel - that the dumb Duelist had grown a bit. Yuma says he was very excited when Shark said that, because it proved that their hearts are connected. 
 Yuma grasps the  Emperor's Key  and adds that he was moved when Shark Dueled  Kite  to protect it. He finishes by saying that through Dueling, their bonds are strengthened. Shark responds that he knows nothing of friends or bonds, the only thing which supports him is his feelings of vengeance towards Yuma. Vetrix's  crest  glows on the back of his hand again. Vetrix claps and yells "Bravo!", adding that Shark is the best. Shark continues that he is here to defeat Yuma to avenge  his younger sister . He asks why Yuma is here if not defeat him. He asks Yuma to spare him the speech and come at him, adding that his turn has already started.
 
       " Gogogo Golem " augmented with " Golden Form ".     
 Yuma supposes he'll have to deliver his thoughts through Dueling then. He switches "Gogogo Golem" to  Attack Position  and activates " Golden Form ", explaining that it will double the  ATK  of "Gogogo Golem" until the next turn as it was switched from Defense Position to Attack Position. "Gogogo Golem" changes form, glowing gold. Heartland calls it shiny and amazing before yelling "Golden Burning!" Bronk wonders what Yuma is thinking, with Caswell finishing the statement by saying that "Gogogo Golem" can't defeat a "Number". Astral seems to think the same, but Yuma says that he must charge head-on to deliver his thoughts to Shark. He orders "Gogogo Golem" to attack with " Great Cannon ", knocking Shark off his feet and his Life Points down to 900. Yuma tells Shark to wake up and get a hold of himself. Heartland calls it a "super-heavy" strike, adding that it puts their Life Points at the same value - 900. Shark sits up to his knees and mutters that Yuma knew he couldn't defeat the "Number", so he targeted his Life Points instead. He adds it will end now though. Yuma  Sets  a card and ends his turn.
 Shark draws, saying he'll finish Yuma off now and avenge his sister. He screams as the purple aura grows more intense. Astral says its coming, while the audience wonders what's going on with the glowing. Shark announces he's using "Shark Drake" as an Overlay Unit and declares a  Chaos Xyz Evolution . "Shark Drake" returns to its sealed form and enters the  Overlay Network , reappearing as " Number C32: Shark Drake Veiss ". Heartland and Faker both appear not to know what a "Chaos Number" is. Vetrix cackles and Yuma says it finally appeared. Astral says they are at overwhelming disadvantage now. Shark activates the effect of "Shark Drake Veiss", detaching an Overlay Unit to  banish  a " Shark " monster from his Graveyard and have "Gogogo Golem" lose ATK equal to the banished monster's ATK. " Spear Shark " bursts from the ground and speeds towards Yuma. Astral says that this is bad and Yuma activates his  face-down  "Power Change Barrier", explaining that he can  negate  the activation of the effect of "Shark Drake Veiss" by reducing the ATK of "Gogogo Golem" by 600. Its ATK becomes 3000 as a golden warrior wielding two shields appears in front of it. Cathy cheers, but Caswell points out that "Shark Drake Veiss" still has Overlay Units left. Astral says it will strike again.
 
         The warrior of " Power Change Barrier " appears to protect "Gogogo Golem".     
 Shark is undeterred and detaches another Overlay Unit, banishing " Double Shark " this time. It bursts from the ground, but Yuma activates the effect of "Power Change Barrier" again, reducing "Gogogo Golem" to 2400 ATK but negating the effect of "Shark Drake Veiss". Shark says that it's not over - he has one Overlay Unit left. He detaches it to banish "Number 32: Shark Drake" from the Graveyard. Yuma uses "Power Change Barrier" a third time. Vetrix cackles, saying that Yuma powered-up "Gogogo Golem" only to reduce it to its original ATK by his own hand. He wonders if Yuma even knows what he's doing. Shark declares that it's useless - the difference between the monsters' ATKs is now 1000 - if this attack connects, Yuma is defeated. He orders an attack with " Depth Chaos Bite ". Yuma activates his face-down " Half Unbreak ", encasing "Gogogo Golem" in a bubble, which halves the  Battle Damage  and prevents its  destruction by battle . Yuma is still blasted backwards, landing on the ground hard with Life Points at 400. Concerned, Tori jumps to her feet. Shark compliments Yuma's persistence, but says that on his next turn, Yuma will fall into hell completely. He Sets " Heraldry Catastrophe " and ends his turn. 
 Astral begins to fade in and out as Vetrix says that Shark is right - Yuma Tsukumo will be eliminated on the next turn with the card he gave Shark as a "present". A brief flashback is shown, where Vetrix hands Shark the "Heraldry Catastrophe" card he had just Set. Yuma says they're alive thanks to "Power Change Barrier" as it and the golden shield warrior vanished. Astral points out that that they only 400 have Life Points left - they must settle it this turn. Yuma declares that he believes in himself and his Deck. He yells " kattobingu !" and draws " Gagaga Magician ", which he immediately  Normal Summons . Yuma overlays his two Level 4 monsters to  Xyz Summon  "Number 39: Utopia" in Attack Position. Shark calls him a fool - Summoning "Utopia" now will do nothing; it can't defeat "Shark Drake Veiss". All Yuma can do now is pitifully struggle until defeat. Yuma tells him he's wrong - "Utopia" is immortal, but so is Shark's "Number". He wants to save Shark, but he doesn't want to lose either. Though he desires to become the champion of the  World Duel Carnival  and settle the score with Vetrix and Faker, he would feel terrible if he lost Shark. He says he'll save Shark by any means necessary.
 Yuma orders an attack with " Hope Sword Slash ". Shark appears himself for moment, but the aura intensifies again and Shark chides Yuma for still rushing head-on like that. He tells "Shark Drake Veiss" to rout "Utopia" with "Depth Chaos Bite". Yuma activates the effect of "Utopia", detaching an Overlay Unit to negate his own attack. Shark is confused and Astral tells Yuma now is the time. He activates his face-down " Rivals Unite ", explaining that when his attack is negated, he can  equip  this card to the opposing monster and take  control  of it. Shark mutters "impossible" and Yuma yells for "Shark Drake Veiss" to leave Shark alone and come to his side. Yuma's friends are impressed that he would take Shark's "Number", but Tori seems worried. 
 
         The  Emperor's Key  fails to stop the power of the " Chaos Number ".     
 "Shark Drake Veiss" vanishes in a burst of golden light, which rushes into the Emperor's Key. Yuma screams as "Shark Drake Veiss" appears above him. Shark yells and Yuma urges him to recall his true heart. Shark remembers his previous Duels with Yuma and realizes it was Vetrix that hurt his sister, not Yuma. He can't believe he was manipulated by the "Number" like that. Shark yells Yuma's name and Yuma is pleased, but screams again as a dark aura emerges, connecting him to "Shark Drake Veiss". Vetrix cackles and appears before Shark in hologram form. He says it looks like Yuma is in great pain - he saved Shark from his agony, but is now suffering himself. Yuma grunts, clutching his chest. Vetrix asks if Shark wishes to save him - they are friends, after all. Shark looks at his Set cards and Vetrix says he's realized it - he must play that Trap Card, "Heraldry Catastrophe". Astral is concerned and Vetrix tells him not to worry - Shark will save them soon. He says that thanks to their efforts to steal the "Number", the Trap Card Shark has can be activated. He explains that when an opponent takes control of a monster, this card can destroy all monsters that player controls, meaning that both monsters will be destroyed.
 Vetrix addresses Shark again, saying that in this way, Yuma can escape the influence of the "Number" as well. But he'll take 5300  damage  in the process. He adds he gave Shark that card because he knew Yuma would try something like this, calling it a lethal trap. Yuma realizes that if "Utopia" is destroyed, Astral will go with him. He wonders if there's another way. He thinks of the " Traplin " in his hand, which can be Special Summoned by  Tributing  a  Continuous Trap Card . He could get rid of "Rivals Unite". Astral points out that that means "Shark Drake Veiss" would  return  to Shark's control and he would be controlled by Vetrix once more. Vetrix cackles, asking who Yuma will choose - Astral or Shark? Vetrix vanishes and Astral tells Yuma to decide. Yuma is confused, but Astral says there's nothing more he can do in this Duel - Yuma is the one thinking and making the decisions. 
 
         The dark aura of the "Chaos Number" electrifies, hurting Yuma further.     
 Yuma doesn't know what to do and screams again, this time as the dark aura connecting him to the "Number" is electrified. Vetrix reappears to Shark, saying he needs to act, as Yuma is in such pain. He should just activate "Heraldry Catastrophe" and be done with it. Yuma is barely able to stand as the electricity continues to flow. He yells that he can't choose, because to him, both Shark and Astral are very important friends. Shark mutters Yuma's name and looks at his other Set card, saying its the one he Set on his first turn. He activates it, revealing it as " Underwater Snow Prison ". This banishes "Shark Drake Veiss", who is encased in ice before vanishing. A stream of ice flies towards him as he adds that as the price for activating it, he will take 1000  damage . He is knocked off his feet when it hits, with Yuma yelling his name. Shark's Life Points hit 0 and Mr. Heartland announces Yuma as the winner, a tone of disbelief in his voice.
 
         Vetrix  shatters the glass, infuriated.     
 Yuma runs to Shark, thanking him for saving them. Shark says he could hear Yuma's voice during that Duel and that Yuma's spirit of "kattobingu" saved him from Vetrix. He thanks him and urges him to defeat Vetrix, adding that he knows Yuma can do it. Vetrix is enraged and glows red with power as the windows of his private box shatter. He wonders when friendship and bonds will cease standing in his way. He says he'll slowly finish Yuma off later with his own hands. Shark is taken away by helicopter and Astral says that Shark saved his life. Yuma says that's right - he did not win the Duel, Shark handed the victory to him. Astral says he entrusted his will to him and Yuma says he will inherit that will and win, ending with "kattobingu!"
 
 Featured Duel: Yuma Tsukumo vs. Shark 
 Duel continues from  the previous episode . 
 Turn 6: Shark 
" Number 32: Shark Drake "  attacks  and  destroys  " Gogogo Ghost " (Yuma: 1800 → 900 LP).  Shark  then  activates  the  effect  of "Shark Drake" to  detach  an  Overlay Unit [Notes 1]  ("Shark Drake": 3 → 2 ORU) and revive "Gogogo Ghost" in Attack Position with 1000 less ATK (1900 → 900/0) in order to let "Shark Drake" attack it again. As "Gogogo Ghost" was Special Summoned, Yuma activates its effect to revive " Gogogo Golem " ( 4/1800/1500) in  Defense Position  and switch "Gogogo Ghost" to Defense Position. "Shark Drake" attacks and destroys "Gogogo Ghost". 
 Turn 7: Yuma 
Yuma  draws  "Power Change Barrier". He then switches "Gogogo Golem" to Attack Position. As "Gogogo Golem" was switched from Defense to Attack Position, Yuma activates " Golden Form " to double the ATK of "Gogogo Golem" ("Gogogo Golem": 1800 → 3600 ATK) until his next  Standby Phase . "Gogogo Golem" attacks "Shark Drake" (Shark: 1700 → 900 LP), but the latter is not  destroyed by battle  as "Gogogo Golem" is not a " Number " monster. Yuma  Sets  a card.
 Turn 8: Shark 
Shark draws "Heraldry Catastrophe". He then overlays "Shark Drake" with its two Overlay Units via  Chaos Xyz Evolution  in order to Xyz Summon " Chaos Number 32: Shark Drake Veiss " ( 4/2800/2100, ORU: 3) in Attack Position. 
 Shark activates the effect of "Shark Drake Veiss" to detach an Overlay Unit ("Shark Drake Veiss": 3 → 2 ORU) and banish " Spear Shark " from his Graveyard in order to reduce the ATK of "Gogogo Golem" by the ATK of "Spear Shark", but Yuma activates his face-down " Power Change Barrier " to negate the effect of "Shark Drake Veiss" and decrease the ATK of "Gogogo Golem" by 600 ("Gogogo Golem": 3600 → 3000 ATK). Shark activates the effect of "Shark Drake Veiss" again ("Shark Drake Veiss": 2 → 1 ORU) by banishing " Double Shark " from his Graveyard, but Yuma activates the effect of "Power Change Barrier" to negate the effect of "Shark Drake Veiss" ("Gogogo Golem": 3000 → 2400 ATK).
 Shark activates the effect of "Shark Drake Veiss" again ("Shark Drake Veiss": 1 → 0 ORU) by banishing "Shark Drake" from his Graveyard, but Yuma activates the effect of "Power Change Barrier" to negate the effect of "Shark Drake Veiss" ("Gogogo Golem": 2400 → 1800 ATK). "Shark Drake Veiss" attacks "Gogogo Golem", but Yuma activates his face-down " Half Unbreak " to prevent his monster's destruction by battle and halve the  Battle Damage  he takes (Yuma: 900 → 400 LP). Shark Sets " Heraldry Catastrophe ". On Shark's  End Phase , the final effect of "Power Change Barrier" destroys itself.
 Turn 9: Yuma 
Yuma draws " Gagaga Magician " and subsequently  Normal Summons  it ( 4/1500/1000) in Attack Position. Yuma overlays "Gogogo Golem" and "Gagaga Magician" in order to Xyz Summon " Number 39: Utopia " ( 4/2500/2000, ORU: 2) in Attack Position. "Utopia" attacks "Shark Drake Veiss" and Yuma activates the effect of "Utopia" to detach an Overlay Unit ("Utopia": 2 → 1 ORU) and negate the attack. As the attack of "Utopia" was negated, Yuma activates his face-down " Rivals Unite " to equip it to "Shark Drake Veiss" and take  control  of it, but it may not attack. This action frees Shark from Vetrix's influence, but the power of "Shark Drake Veiss" begins to hurt Yuma due to the Emperor's Key not being able to protect him from "Shark Drake Veiss". Vetrix tells Shark to use his face-down "Heraldry Catstrophe" to destroy both of Yuma's monsters and inflict their total ATK as damage to Yuma while Yuma has the thought of Special Summoning " Traplin " by destroying "Rivals Unite" despite that would allow Vetrix to control Shark again.
 Shark activates his face-down " Underwater Snow Prison " to banish "Shark Drake Veiss", but take 1000 damage as a drawback due to "Shark Drake Veiss" being a  WATER  monster (Shark: 900 → 0 LP).
