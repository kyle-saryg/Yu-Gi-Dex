 Featured Duel: Yuya Sakaki vs. Yuri 
       Yuya vs. Yuri     
 At the start of the  Duel , the  Field Spell Card  " Crossover " is  activated , as per the rules of an  Action Duel . It will allow the players to use  Action Cards , but they may only have one in their  hand  at a time.
 Turn 1: Yuri 
Yuri  Normal Summon  " Predaplant Ophrys Scorpio " (1200/800). As it was Normal Summoned, Yuri  activates  its  effect , which lets him  send  a " Predaplant "  monster  from his  hand  to the  Graveyard  to Special Summon a Level 3 or lower "Predaplant" monster from his  Deck . Yuri sends " Predaplant Stapeliaworm " and Special Summon " Predaplant Darlingtonia Cobra " (1000/1500). As "Darlingtonia Cobra" was Special Summoned Yuri activates its effect, which lets him  add  " Polymerization " from his Deck to his hand. Yuri activates "Polymerization",  fusing  "Darlingtonia Cobra" and "Ophrys Scorpio" on his  field  to  Fusion Summon  " Starving Venom Fusion Dragon " in  Attack Position  (2800/2000). Yuri  Sets  a card.
 Turn 2: Yuya 
Yuya's hand contains " Starlight Force ", " Performapal Coin Dragon ", " Stargazer Magician ", " Timegazer Magician " and " Odd-Eyes Pendulum Dragon ". Yuya draws " Smile World ". Yuya activates "Stargazer Magician" (   1) and "Timegazer Magician" (   8) in his  Pendulum Zones . Yuya  Pendulum Summon  "Odd-Eyes" (2500/2000) and "Coin Dragon" (1700/1000) in Attack Position. The effect of "Coin Dragon" increases the  ATK  of all  Dragon   Type  monsters by 500 and prevents them from being  destroyed  by card effects ("Odd-Eyes": 2500 → 3000 ATK, "Coin Dragon": 1700 → 2200 ATK). "Odd-Eyes" attacks "Starving Venom", but Yuri activates " Predaprouting ", preventing the destruction of "Starving Venom" and destroying the attacking monster, but the effect of "Coin Dragon" prevents "Odd-Eyes" from being destroyed. The effect of "Odd-Eyes" doubles the battle damage since "Starving Venom" is Level 5 or higher (Yuri: 4000 → 3600 LP). The second effect of "Predaprouting" lets Yuri Special Summon three " Predaplant Tokens " (0/0) in Defense Position. "Coin Dragon" attacks and destroys a "Predaplant Token". Yuya Sets a card. 
 Turn 3: Yuri 
Yuri  Tributes  a "Predaplant Token" to  Tribute Summon  " Predaplant Banksiogre " (2000/100). He  tunes  the remaining Level 1 "Predaplant Token" with the Level 6  Tuner monster  "Banksiogre" to  Synchro Summon  " Clear Wing Synchro Dragon " (2500/2000) in Attack Position. Yuri activates the effect of "Starving Venom", which lets him negate the effects of a monster Yuya controls and have "Starving Venom" gain its effects until the End Phase. He negates the effect of "Odd-Eyes" and grants its effects to "Starving Venom". Yuya activates "Starlight Force", negating the effects of all monsters Special Summoned from the Extra Deck, and changing their Levels to 4. The effects of "Starving Venom" and "Clear Wing" are negated, and their Levels become 4 ("Starving Venom":   8 →   4; "Clear Wing":   7 →   4). During each Standby Phase, "Starlight Force" increases the Levels of all monsters Yuri controls by 1. Should the combined Levels of Yuri's monsters become less than or equal to that of Yuya's, "Starlight Force" will destroy itself. "Clear Wing" attacks and destroys "Coin Dragon" (Yuya: 4000 → 3700 LP, "Odd-Eyes": 3000 → 2500 ATK). "Starving Venom" attacks and destroys "Odd-Eyes" (Yuya: 3700 → 3400 LP). Yuri Sets a card.
 Turn 4: Yuya 
Yuya draws " Performapal Drop Gallop ". During the Standby Phase, the effect of "Starlight Force" increases the Levels of Yuri's monsters by 1 ("Starving Venom":   4 →   5; "Clear Wing":   4 →   5). Yuya Pendulum Summon "Odd-Eyes" (2500 → 3000/2000) and "Coin Dragon" (1700 → 2200/1000) from his Extra Deck and "Drop Gallop" (800/1200) from his hand in Attack Position. As "Drop Gallop" was Pendulum Summoned, Yuya activates its effect, which lets him draw cards equal to the number of "Performapal" monsters Pendulum Summoned at the same time, in this case, two. Yuya activates the other effect of "Drop Gallop" as he controls a Level 5 or higher monster, which lets him change its Level from 1 to 4. Yuya changes the Level of "Dropgallop" to 4. He  overlays  the Level 4 "Coin Dragon" and "Drop Gallop" to  Xyz Summon  " Dark Rebellion Xyz Dragon " (2500/2000) in Attack Position. Yuya's hand contains an unknown Monster Card, a  Trap Card  and "Smile World". Yuri activates " Dragonvine ", as he controls a Dragon-Type monster, allowing him to take control of a Dragon-Type monster Yuya controls that is not the one with the highest Level. Yuri takes control of "Dark Rebellion".
 Duel continues in the next episode .
