 A New Enemy?! 
 
 "Separation...and Determination!"  is the fifteenth chapter of the  Yu-Gi-Oh! GX  manga . It was first printed in Japanese in  V Jump  magazine and in English in  Shonen Jump  magazine. Both of which were printed in  volume 2  of the  Yu-Gi-Oh! GX  graphic novels afterwards.
 
 Summary 
 Practical skills class is starting. It's announced that it will be conducted jointly among  Slifer Red ,  Ra Yellow  and  Obelisk Blue  students.  Syrus Truesdale  is worried about being matched against a Blue, while  Jaden  is excited at the prospect.  Chazz Princeton  is too angry after his previous  conversation  with Jaden, and still curious as how Jaden obtained " Elemental Hero Terra Firma " from  Koyo Hibiki , not knowing their past history.  Midori Hibiki  is aware of the existence of card spirits, commenting that in duels conducted through the technology and science, the spirits exist without any explanation. She wonders if the few people for can see spirits, such as herself and Jaden will have to pay the same terrible price that Koyo did.
 Another flashback ensues, with Jaden rushing to the hospital to inform Koyo that he's entering the town's dueling tournament. No visitors are allowed, and Midori informs him that Koyo is in a coma, and will be indefinitely. Jaden promises to become a duelist, and then he and Midori notice  Winged Kuriboh's spirit . Jaden runs to the roof of the hospital, where they had dueled, unable to accept Koyo's condition. Winged Kuriboh's spirit follows him up there, and he recognizes what it is.
 Back in the present, Jaden faces an Obelisk Blue student in the class, and beckons his "partner" to come with him. Midori concludes that she does not know what Winged Kuriboh is, but that Koyo is still alive because of him. Jaden, stepping up to his duel, thinks that he's keeping his promise to Koyo, training to become a duelist while wearing the same red that he once wore, and promises to have a fun duel with Koyo when the day comes.
