 " Photon " (フォトン  Foton ) is an  archetype  of  LIGHT   monsters  used by  Kite Tenjo ,  Dextra  and  Nistro  in  Yu-Gi-Oh! ZEXAL , and created by  Dr. Faker  and  Mr. Heartland  together. This archetype was first released in  Photon Shockwave . Most of the monsters in this archetype have armored or scaly bodies that emit blue light. The "Photon" archetype is intimately related to the " Galaxy " archetype.
 In the anime, Kite's Deck was created by using science from another dimension, [1]  later revealed to be  Barian World , [2]  though  Astral  compared the energy of " Galaxy-Eyes Photon Dragon " to that of his  own world . [3] 
 In the Italian version, the inclusion of cards whose names contain the feminine word "Fotonica" (e.g. " Regina Alexandra Fotonica ") seems to be implicit because their names don't contain "Fotonico".
 In physics, a  photon  is an elementary particle, the quantum of light and all other forms of electromagnetic radiation, and the force carrier for the electromagnetic force.

 Strategy 
 The goal of a "Photon" Deck is to take  control  of the  field . The archetype features a fantastic variety of  Swarm  cards, including " Accellight ", " Photon Lead ", " Twin Photon Lizard " and " Paladin of Photon Dragon "– a ritual monster that can be summoned twice with the same  Ritual Spell Card . Besides this, many "Photon" cards focus on Summoning their ace monster, " Galaxy-Eyes Photon Dragon ", which is a good example of "Photon" field control: its  self-banishing   Quick Effect  allows it to evade  Traps  like " Dimensional Prison " and bypass other card effects. Another example is " Photon Leo ", which can  shuffle  cards in your opponent's  hand  back into the Deck. This can be a very disruptive effect in numerous situations. Lower- Level  "Photon" monsters have more strategic uses, such as adding different "Photon"  Monster Cards  to your hand or even multiplying themselves. This can also go hand-in-hand with "Galaxy" cards, though the searching effects of both via " Photon Lizard " and " Galaxy Wizard ".
 All "Photon" monsters are  LIGHT  and as such receive benefits from LIGHT  support  cards such as " Honest ".
 "Photon" monsters are unique in that they often have effects that play with the  Rule of 2000 – many of the archetype's low-level monsters feature 2000+  ATK  to make them viable sacrifices for "Galaxy-Eyes Photon Dragon", while also augmenting their abilities as beaters. However, because of their incongruously high ATK, low-Level Photons often come with restriction effects to balance out their power. For example, the effect of " Photon Crusher " mimics the early beatdown favorite " Goblin Attack Force ", forcing it into  Defense Position  after every attack (its DEF is 0), while " Photon Thrasher " is a  Semi-Nomi  monster that can only attack if it is alone on the field. The  TCG / OCG  original Level 3 " Photon Sabre Tiger " loses 800 ATK if it's the only copy of itself on your side of the field, but sports 2000-point  Original ATK score  if more than one exists.
 "Photon" monsters are generally difficult to defeat in battle (most notably "Galaxy-Eyes", which can never lose at one-on-one combat due to its effect, if not interrupted). However, the archetype focus most of its effort towards offensive plays, and lacks defensive capacity– featuring little to no protection against hostile card effects.
