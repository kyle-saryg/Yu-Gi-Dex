 Summary 
 Seeing right through  Noah 's mind games,  Kaiba  heads through the streets of  Gozaburo 's virtual  Domino City  for  KaibaCorp  and finds his stepfather in the President's office. 
 Gozaburo  unleashes a  Duel Monster  army (consisting of  Cosmo Queen , an army of  Skull Knights , an army of  Command Knights , an army of  Lizard Soldiers , and an army of  Rock Ogre Grotto #1s ) on  Yugi  and his friends, but they fight back with their own cards.
 Kaiba orders Gozaburo to shut down his  Virtual World  and release all the minds trapped here, but Gozaburo says that Kaiba must earn his freedom and challenges him to a  Duel . 
 To remind his stepson of the painful moment he'd experienced when he dueled Yugi, who'd achieved the impossible by  Summoning   Exodia  in their first duel, Gozaburo reveals that he is using an  Exodia Deck . 
 Ultimately, Gozaburo  summons  a  monster  called " Exodia Necross ", who seems to be nearly as invincible as its "Forbidden One" counterpart; as long as the 5 pieces of Exodia remain in Gozaburo's Graveyard, "Exodia Necross" is immune to  destruction by battle , as well as the effects of Trap or Magic cards that can affect or destroy it.
 Meanwhile, Noah has escaped to the real world in  Mokuba 's body and sets into motion his plans to  destroy  the virtual fortress with his father's own satellite missiles, deleting every mind trapped in cyberspace, but he suddenly has a change of heart when he remembers the way Mokuba considered Noah his brother despite the way he had been treated. Noah rushes back to try to help everyone escape, but  Yami Marik  has destroyed the controls, leaving no way to override the satellite's attack.
 Noah speaks to everyone in the virtual world, warning them the place will be destroyed and their minds will be lost if they do not escape.
 
 Featured Duel: Seto Kaiba vs. Gozaburo Kaiba - Part 1 
 Turn 1: Gozaburo 
Gozaburo draws. He then  activates  " Painful Choice " to select five cards from his  Deck  (They are the five pieces of " Exodia the Forbidden One ") and let Seto choose one card which will be added to Gozaburo's hand. Seto chooses to add " Right Arm of the Forbidden One " to Gozaburo's  hand  while the other pieces of "Exodia" are  discarded  to Gozaburo's  Graveyard . Gozaburo then  Sets  a  monster .
 Turn 2: Kaiba 
Kaiba draws. He then  Sets  a card and  Normal Summons  " Vorse Raider " (1900/1200) in Attack Position. "Vorse Raider"  attacks  and destroys  Gozaburo 's  face-down   monster , "Right Arm of the Forbidden One" (200/300).
 Turn 3: Gozaburo 
Gozaburo draws " Contract with Exodia " and subsequently activates it. Since all 5 pieces of " Exodia the Forbidden One " are in his  Graveyard , Gozaburo pays 2000 Life Points ( Gozaburo  4000 → 2000) to  Special Summon  " Exodia Necross " (1800/0) to the  field  in Attack Position. "Exodia Necross" attacks "Vorse Raider" ( Gozaburo  2000 → 1900). Normally Gozaburo's  monster  would be  destroyed  at this point, but "Exodia Necross" can't be destroyed in battle. Instead, whenever it battles with a monster, it gains 1000  ATK  at the end of the Damage Step (" Exodia Necross ": 1800 → 2800/0).
 Turn 4: Kaiba 
Kaiba draws. He then  Normal Summons  " Spirit Ryu " (1000/1000) in  Attack Position . Kaiba then  activates  his face-down " Burst Breath " to Tribute "Spirit Ryu" to  destroy  all  monsters  on the  field  with equal or lower  DEF  than the  ATK  of the tributed monster. Since "Exodia Necross" has a  DEF  of 0, it would normally be destroyed, but it remains on the field because it can't be destroyed by the  effects  of  Magic  or  Trap Cards . 
 Gozaburo explains that the presence of each piece of " Exodia the Forbidden One " in his  Graveyard  adds a special  effect  to "Exodia Necross". " Left Leg of the Forbidden One " prevents it from being  destroyed  by  Magic Cards , " Right Leg of the Forbidden One " protects it from being destroyed by  Trap Cards , " Left Arm of the Forbidden One " protects it from the special effects of monsters, " Right Arm of the Forbidden One " allows it to gain + 1000  ATK  with every battle and finally the " head of Exodia " protects it from being destroyed by monsters in battle. Kaiba then  Sets  a card and  switches  "Vorse Raider" to  Defense Position .
 Duel concludes next episode. 
 
 Differences In Adaptations 
 Cut from the US version is a brief scene of Jounouchi kicking a can in frustration. 
 A close up of  Exodia Necross  is cut from the US version. 
 Cut from the dubbed version is a shot of crazy  Yami Marik  wagging his tongue. 
 In the US version, the  Exodia  pieces have been changed to show a circle behind them instead of star points. 
 Trivia 
 This  Duel  is the only one in the  Virtual World  involving no  Deck Masters . 
 The Monster Army Gozaboro summons is themed around chess, with Gozaboro himself representing the King:
 Lizard Soldier = Pawn. 
 Rock Ogre Grotto #1 = Rook. 
 Command Knight = Knight. 
 Skull Knight = Bishop. 
 Cosmo Queen = Queen.
 This idea would be later revisited as the Chess Archfiends.
