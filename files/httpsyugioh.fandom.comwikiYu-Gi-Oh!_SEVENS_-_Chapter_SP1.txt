 "Yu-Gi-Oh! SEVENS Start Rush Guide"  is a special manga chapter of  Yu-Gi-Oh! SEVENS . This has been given away as a promo item to let new players familiarize with  Rush Duel  concepts. It features cards from  Luke  and  Yuga  Rush Duel  Starter Decks .
 
 
 Featured Duel: Yuga Ohdo vs. Tatsuhisa "Luke" Kamijo 
 This Duel is conducted as a  Rush Duel .
 Turn 1: Yuga Ohdo 
Yuga  Normal Summons  " Dark Sorcerer " (Level 4/1500/0), " Magical Beast Wolfram " (Level 3/1100/100) and " Spell Archer " (Level 3/1000/400). He then  sets  two cards.
 Turn 2: Tatsuhisa "Luke" Kamijo 
Luke Normal Summons " Palm-Sized Drago " (Level 1/0/1400), " Dragon Bat " (Level 3/1000/400) and " Dragolite " (Level 4/1500/0). He then activates " Fire Dragon's Heatflash "  Normal Spell Card , which destroys Yuga's set  Trap Card . Luke then tributes "Palm-Sized Drago" and "Dragon Bat" to  Tribute Summon  " Rush Dragon Dragears " (Level 7/2500/1500).
 Luke activates "Dragears'" effect, sending the top card of his  Deck  to let his  monster  attack twice during the  Battle Phase  of this  turn . "Dreagears" attacks and destroys "Dark Sorcerer" and "Spell Archer" (Yuga: 8000 → 7000 → 5600 LP). "Dragolite" attacks "Spell Archer", though Yuya activates his set " Curtain of Sparks ", which reduces the ATK of "Dragolite" by 500 ("Dragolite": 1500 → 1000 ATK). As the ATK of "Dragolite" is now equal to that of "Spell Archer", both monsters are destroyed.
 Turn 3: Yuga Ohdo 
As Yuya has no cards in his hand, he  draws  five cards during his  Draw Phase . His hand contains " Mystic Dealer ", " Luminous Shaman ", " Stray Familiar ", " Wind Spirit's Blessing " and " Magical Stream ".
 Yuga Normal Summons "Luminous Shaman" (Level 2/500/0) and "Mystic Dealer" (Level 3/1000/0). He activates the latter's effect to discard "Stray Familiar" to draw one card. He draws " Sevens Road Magician " and subsequently tributes the two monsters to tribute summon it (Level 7/2100/1500). Yuya sends one card from the top of his Deck to the  Graveyard  to activate the effect of his magician: for every different  Attribute  of his monsters in his Graveyard, the magician gains 300 ATK. As there are six unique Attributes in the Graveyard, "Sevens Road Magician" gains 1800 ATK ("Sevens Road Magician": 2100 → 3900 ATK). Next, Yuga plays " Wind Spirit's Blessing " to have his magician gain 1000 ATK ("Sevens Road Magician": 3900 → 4900 ATK).
 "Sevens Road Magician" attacks "Rush Dragon Dragears" (Luke: 8000 → 5600 LP). At the end of the turn, the ATK bonus of "Sevens Road Magician" expires ("Sevens Road Magician": 4900 → 2100 ATK).
 The rest of the Duel is not shown.
