      The black fog     
 The  black fog  was a cloud of dark matter the  Dark Signers  spread throughout  Satellite . Anyone who got engulfed by the fog had their body absorbed into it.
 Crow  had his Duel with  Lazar  aborted due to the appearance of the black fog. Lazar escaped using his balloon, while Crow managed to survive the ordeal by hiding in a refrigerator. Upon learning that the children he had been taking care of had become victims of the black fog, Crow vows to take revenge on the Dark Signers.
 When  Roman Goodwin  Summoned " Earthbound Immortal Uru ", the fog was sucked into its giant heart, and the people trapped by the fog were used to Summon "Uru". This also occurred when  Carly Carmine  Summoned her "Earthbound Immortal", " Aslla piscu ".
