       Better angle of Romin.     
 Romin doesn't like Duels much but she tends to cross paths with  Yuga  and his friends. She also has a mysterious aura around her persona and seems to know more things than she lets on. She gets reasonably along with Yuga and his friends, and despite not being too interested in Duels she is fairly observant, a fast learner and impressively tactical for a newbie.
