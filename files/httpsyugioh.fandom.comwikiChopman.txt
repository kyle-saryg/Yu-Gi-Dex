 Design 
 Chopman's backstory is very reminiscent of  Jason Voorhees , albeit killing children instead of adults. His mask is typical of Jason's,  Michael Myers'  and  Leatherface's . The use of a chainsaw is typical of Leatherface. His wisecracks and calculated insanity seem to stem from  Freddy Krueger .
 
 Biography 
 Domino Lake murders 
 One summer at a camp near  Domino Lake , Chopman murdered ten boy scouts who had been staying there, in a single night. He chopped their bodies into unrecognizable pieces. The news of the murders had all of  Domino City  in fear. The suspect came to be known as "The Chopman", but was not captured and remained at large. [1] 
 
 Death-T 
 KaibaCorp  later hired the Chopman for the Horror Zone stage of their  Death-T  theme park. [1] 
 After  Yugi  and his friends passed the  bllood puzzle  inside the  Murderer's Mansion , a trapdoor to the basement and exit opened, with the Chopman hidden inside. [1]  The Chopman reached out and swiped  Johji , kidnapping him. Under Kaiba's orders the Chopman was not to kill Johji yet, as they needed him to lure in Yugi and his friends. [2] 
 Johji was made sit on a podium in the center of a room, with the Chopman hidden in the darkness behind him. Johji unsuccessfully tried to convince the others to come inside, lying that he was alone. When it became clear that the group weren't going to come in, a screen lit-up on the Chopman's torso, with Kaiba on it. Kaiba asked Yugi and his friends to send one of their players inside or the Chopman would kill Johji. [2] 
 
       Chopman battles Jonouchi.     
 Jonouchi  stepped inside and went over to collect Johji and the door slammed shut behind him. However, Johji strapped a handcuff onto Jonouchi, which was connected to a chain strung through the podium and onto the Chopman's wrist. Jonouchi was forced to face the Chopman in a  deathmatch , using an array of weapons hanging from the ceiling. [2] 
 The Chopman climbed on the podium and took the chainsaw. He was able to use his brute force to pull Jonouchi over to him by yanking the chain. The chainsaw got stuck on the podium as the Chopman made a swing at Jonouchi and Johji. As he tried to free it, he didn't pay attention to Jonouchi, who picked and unlocked his end of the handcuff using a candlestick, strapped the chain onto the door and slid the candle inside it. After the Chopman freed the chainsaw, he spotted Jonouchi over by the door. Trying to pull him over again, he yanked the chain, ripping the door out of the wall. Jonouchi escaped and the candle hit the oil-covered floor, incinerating the Chopman. [2]
