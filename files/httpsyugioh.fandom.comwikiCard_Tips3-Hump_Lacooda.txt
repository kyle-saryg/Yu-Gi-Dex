 This card can be searched by " Dogu ", " Single Purchase ", " Temple of the Kings ", " Ties of the Brethren ", " Painful Escape ", " Transmodify ", " Sangan ", " Broken Blocker ", " Serpentine Princess ", " Vampire Dragon ", " Rescue Ferret ", " Giant Rat ", " BOXer ", " Frontline Observer ", " Sphere of Chaos ", " Dragunity Corsesca ", " Ninjitsu Art of Transformation ", " Super-Nimble Mega Hamster ", " Rescue Cat ", " Witch of the Black Forest ", and " Key Mouse ".
 If using "Rescue Cat", activate the  existing  "3-Hump Lacooda's" effect to tribute the other two "3-Hump Lacoodas". Otherwise, you would be left open to an attack as the remaining "3-Hump Lacooda" would be destroyed. 
 If you have a " Green Baboon, Defender of the Forest " in your hand or Graveyard, you can also tribute one of the "Lacoodas" summoned by Rescue Cat and the remaining one to get 3 cards, and then when the remaining one is destroyed by the effect of "Rescue Cat", pay 1000 Life Points to have "Green Baboon" and likely a Hand Advantage. 
 " Inferno Reckless Summon " can be used to get out 3 "3-Hump Lacoodas". Note that "Inferno Reckless Summon" can't be activated during the Damage Step. 
 Monsters that can change their names into the names of other monsters like " Phantom of Chaos " can be useful with this card.
