 Manga 
 If the effect of " Time Wizard " is successful, all monsters on the field are aged. Monsters typically become visibly wrinkled, decayed, and rusted. This results in them becoming much weaker or destroyed.
 " Baby Dragon " is the only monster shown to have been positively affected.

 Anime 
 Aged counterparts functioned in the anime, largely the same as in the manga.
 An additional card is shown to benefit from the aging effect of " Time Wizard "; " Dark Magician ", which becomes " Dark Sage ". Like most monsters, "Dark Sage" is weakened in terms of  ATK . However it also gains  effects .

 OCG / TCG 
 The anime and manga aging process did not conform well to the rules of the real world card game.
 " Thousand Dragon " was instead made a  Fusion Monster , with " Time Wizard " and " Baby Dragon " as its material.
 " Dark Sage ", which was released much later, was given a Summoning method closer to its anime self. It is a  Main Deck  card, Summoned by Tributing " Dark Magician " after applying the positive effect of "Time Wizard". Unlike its anime self, it is stronger than "Dark Magician" in terms of ATK and DEF. It has a weaker effect than its anime self.

 Yu-Gi-Oh! Forbidden Memories 
 In  Yu-Gi-Oh! Forbidden Memories , all the aged counterparts can be created through  Fusion Summon , using " Time Wizard " and the younger counterpart.
 If the player does not have the actual card for the aged counterpart, they can Summon the monster through Fusion Summon. If they have the actual card, they can Summon it normally, without performing a Fusion Summon.
 Unlike other media, the younger counterpart, can be one of many cards.
