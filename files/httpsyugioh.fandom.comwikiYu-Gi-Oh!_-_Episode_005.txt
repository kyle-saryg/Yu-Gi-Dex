 "The Ultimate Great Moth" , known as  "Ultimate Perfect Form, Great Moth"  in the Japanese version, is the fifth episode of the  Yu-Gi-Oh!  second series anime . It first aired in Japan on May 16, 2000 and in the United States on October 20, 2001. 
 Yugi  has squashed all but one of  Weevil 's  monsters , but unfortunately, Weevil has saved his best for last: his " Cocoon of Evolution ", that grows stronger every turn until it hatches into an unstoppable " Great Moth ".
 When this episode first aired in the United States on  Kids WB! , it was merged with the previous episode, so the Duel took place in just one episode titled " The Ultimate Great Moth ". The two separate episodes were dubbed, but were only seen in other countries and on DVD and VHS until  4Kids TV  aired the episodes separately on December 2 and December 9, 2006.

 Summary 
 Joey ,  Tristan , and  Téa  congratulate  Yugi  on wiping out all of  Weevil 's  monsters . Then  Mai Valentine  shows up to tell them that Yugi doesn't have a chance against the National Champion.
 Weevil attempts to Summon his " Great Moth " by playing " Larvae Moth "  equipped  with " Cocoon of Evolution " saying that in five turns, his "Larvae Moth" will undergo a startling transformation, becoming the "Ultimate Great Moth".
 Yugi falls behind and the gang encourage him to not give up. Mai mocks them telling them that their friendship speeches won't work. Teá retorts, telling Mai that she doesn't know about friendship.
 Yugi appears to destroy to "Cocoon", but only stops its evolution one turn early, causing " Great Moth " to be Summoned. Mai thinks the gang's not cheering now, Weevil's creature is unbeatable. They can chatter from the sidelines all they want, but it won't help Yugi one bit. (Japanese, Mai thinks, "So this is Haga's trump card." She's never seen it before. Haga's practically won already. Yugi's in a tight spot now.)
 Yugi thinks Weevil turned the Duel around one more time, but Yugi's not giving up yet. He tells Weevil he'll find a way to squash that over-sized bug.
 Yugi manages to dampen the Moth with " Makiu, the Magical Mist ", which in turn powers up his " Summoned Skull ", who attacks with electricity.  Yugi attacks, and destroys "Great Moth", wiping out the rest of Weevil's Life Points.
 The gang cheer Yugi's win, while Mai stands with her mouth open. Impressive, she says. She didn't think Yugi could ever beat Weevil. (Japanese, Mai says now she sees how Yugi beat  Kaiba .)
 Yugi stands over a sniveling Weevil, telling him he won his duels by lying and cheating, but a true champion plays with honor. (Japanese, Yugi says, who would have thought that the first one to be sent home would be the all-Japan champion?) He takes Weevil's Star Chips, and Joey relieves Weevil of his dueling glove. (The word "Retire" is written across Haga's "card" in the Japanese version, and his name, "Insector Haga," is written on the top.)
 Yugi has three Star Chips now. But he still needs seven more to gain entry into the  castle , where his  grandfather  is being held prisoner, and he'll battle  Pegasus  once and for all!
 
 Featured Duel: Yami Yugi vs. Weevil Underwood 
 
 This Duel uses  Duelist Kingdom  gameplay. Rules and  card effects  may differ from that of the  TCG / OCG . See the individual card articles for more information.     
 Duel continues from the previous episode . 
 Weevil  has 555  LP  remaining and  controls  one Set card (" Parasite Worm "). 
 Yugi  has 1350 LP remaining and controls " Dark Magician " (2500/2100) in  Attack Position , " Torike " (1200/600)  Set  and no other Set cards.
 Turn 17: Weevil 
 Weevil  Sets " Larvae Moth ".
 Turn 18: Yami Yugi 
Yugi  activates  " Monster Recovery " to return his  hand  and all  monsters  he  controls  ("Dark Magician" and "Torike") to his  Deck  and  draw  five cards. Yugi then Normal Summons " Kuriboh " (300/200) in  Attack Position , but Weevil activates his face-down " Parasite Worm " to  destroy  "Kuriboh" and inflict  damage  to Yugi equal to its  ATK  (Yugi: 1350 → 1050 LP).
 Turn 19: Weevil 
Weevil draws. He then  Flip Summons  " Larvae Moth " (500 → 650/400 → 520) in  Defense Position . He then  equips  "Larvae Moth" with " Cocoon of Evolution ", making its ATK and DEF equal to that of "Cocoon of Evolution" ("Larvae Moth": 650 → 0/520 → 2000 → 2600). Weevil can Special Summon " Great Moth " in two turns.
 Turn 20: Yami Yugi 
Yugi  Normal Summons  " Gaia The Fierce Knight " (2300/2100) in Attack Position. "Gaia"  attacks  "Larvae Moth". The attack fails (Yugi: 1050 → 750 LP).
 Turn 21: Weevil 
Weevil draws, then passes. Weevil can Special Summon "Great Moth" in one turn.
 Turn 22: Yami Yugi 
Yugi draws " Beaver Warrior " and subsequently Sets it.
 Turn 23: Weevil 
Weevil passes. Weevil can Special Summon "Great Moth" at any time during his turn, or Special Summon " Perfectly Ultimate Great Moth " in two turns.
 Turn 24: Yami Yugi 
Yugi draws, then passes.
 Turn 25: Weevil 
Weevil draws, then passes. Weevil can Special Summon " Perfectly Ultimate Great Moth " in one turn.
 Turn 26: Yami Yugi 
Yugi draws. He then Normal Summons " Curse of Dragon " (2000/1500) in Attack Position. Yugi activates " Burning Land " to destroy the  Field  ("Larvae Moth": 0/2600 → 2000). "Gaia" attacks and destroys "Larvae Moth". Upon its destruction, Weevil Special Summons " Great Moth " (2600/2500) in Attack Position, since "Cocoon of Evolution" had been equipped with "Larvae Moth" for four turns.
 Turn 27: Weevil 
Weevil draws. "Great Moth" attacks "Gaia", but Yugi activates " Polymerization " from his hand to  fuse  "Curse of Dragon" with "Gaia" and  Fusion Summon  " Gaia the Dragon Champion " (2600/2100) in Attack Position. A  replay  occurs, and "Great Moth" attacks and destroys Yugi's Set "Beaver Warrior" (1200/1500). At this point, the poisonous scales of "Great Moth" continually decrease the ATK of "Gaia the Dragon Champion" ("Gaia the Dragon Champion": 2600 → 1900/2300).
 Turn 28: Yami Yugi 
Yugi draws " Makiu, the Magical Mist " and subsequently activates it. The air is dampened, which stops the ATK of "Gaia the Dragon Champion" from decreasing further.
 Turn 29: Weevil 
Weevil draws. "Great Moth" attacks and destroys "Gaia the Dragon Champion" (Yugi: 750 → 50 LP).
 Turn 30: Yami Yugi 
Yugi draws. He then Normal Summons " Summoned Skull " (2500/1200) in Attack Position. The effect of "Makiu" increases the ATK of "Summoned Skull" by 1000 ("Summoned Skull": 2500 → 3500/1200). "Summoned Skull" attacks and destroys "Great Moth" (Weevil: 555 → 0 LP).
 
 Aftermath 
 Yami Yugi wins and attains Weevil's title as National Champion as well as Weevil's two  Star Chips .  Joey  takes Weevil's  Dueling Gauntlet , allowing him to officially participate in the  Duelist Kingdom  tournament.
 
 Differences in adaptations 
 When  Mai  makes her appearance at the beginning of the episode a shot of her breasts is cut from the dub. 
 Yugi 's " Monster Recovery " card gets a little redesign in the dub. 
 When Yugi summons "Gaia The Fierce Knight", the card's art remains in place on the original Japanese card, but with the rest of the card colored out (in yellow for Normal Monster) and the bottom of the Dub card appears under the artwork (as it normally does) making the card much smaller than usual. 
 Yugi's " Polymerization " uses its  alternate artwork , a trend which continues in future episodes. 
 A description (in Japanese text) for how the fusion works for " Gaia the Dragon Champion " is erased from the dub. 
 A flashback of Yugi running through the bug-infested forest is cut from the dub. 
 Yugi's " Makiu, the Magical Mist " card is redesigned in the dub. 
 At the end of the episode, a card of  Weevil  appears, erased from it his name and the word RETIRED (both in Japanese print). 
 Errors 
 When the ATK and DEF of "Great Moth" are first shown, its DEF is 2500, but the next scenes continually show it as 2300.
