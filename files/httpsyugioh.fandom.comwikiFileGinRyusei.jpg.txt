 Lorenzo , known in Japan as  Ryusei Gin 「銀流星」( Gin Ryūsei ) is the former world champion of a "Shooting Game" arcade game and a member of the  Society of Light , who is employed by  Alexis Rhodes  and  Chazz Princeton  to  Duel   Jaden Yuki . 
 Although he is defeated by Jaden, he comes to understand his opponent's definition of a fun Duel.  Sartorius  punishes Lorenzo for his failure, taking complete control of him and his future and leaving Lorenzo's hair stark white, which Chazz describes as being "reborn".

 Design 
 Etymology 
 "Gin" means "Silver" and "Ryusei" means "Meteor".
 
 Voices/Mannerisms 
 In the English dub, he speaks with an Italian-American accent and uses such stereotypical phrases as "Bada-bing!", "Mama Mia!", "Y'know what I'm sayin'?!" and "Fuggedaboutit!". In the Japanese version, he instead says "zura" after his sentences.
 
 Deck 
 Lorenzo plays a  " B.E.S "  Deck . With the  effect  of " Boss Rush ", Lorenzo is able to continuously  Summon  "B.E.S."  monsters  as they are  destroyed , causing extra  damage  with " Cyber Summon Blaster ". The flaw of this strategy, however, is that he is no longer able to Summon in any other manner as long as "Boss Rush" remains in play, due to the fact most of his monsters being level 5 or 6. 
 The concept of Lorenzo's cards is derived from the  Konami  video game series,  Gradius , wherein a common element is a boss marathon consisting of about five bosses near the end of the game without any breaks between bosses.
