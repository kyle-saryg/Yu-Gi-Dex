 Official English translation

 Not officially, but there might be some unauthorised  scanlations . --  Deltaneos  12:26, 23 April 2008 (UTC) 
 is pegasus Dead???
 
 Cards in R? 
 Shouldn't the coding for card pages be updated for this manga? I've spotted a bunch of cards from the manga (some also in the anime) up to where I am, chapter 4 and I even tried to edit bounce but Manga_R and such doesn't seem to work  Mattwo  03:52, 25 July 2009 (UTC)
 
 Are you capitalising it that way? Template parameters are case sensitive. It must be capitalised  manga_r  in order to work. --  Deltaneos  ( talk ) 18:56, 25 July 2009 (UTC) 
 will yugioh R ever be a anime show for america? 
 Is there a chance that Yugioh R will be a anime in english? if so when will it be out on tv?
 
 A 'lil mention 
 Should we say what the special rules are that appear on the back of volume 4?

 No canon? 
 Isit part of the canon? I havent read it but if Pegasus died it couldnt be canon because in the manga he was killed by bakura and in the anime he was alive in season 4.-- 93.128.5.157  ( talk ) 17:50, January 8, 2012 (UTC)
 
 French cover 
 We've got a  French cover  that needs to be added to the table. I've never been good with those sorts of edits. -- Golden Key  ( talk  •  contribs ) 15:53, February 25, 2013 (UTC)
 
 Done, plus  some other cleanup . If you come across French covers of the other volumes, they should be all but trivial to add to the table now. =)  「 ディノ 奴 千？！ 」 ?  ·  ☎ Dinoguy1000  19:17, February 25, 2013 (UTC) 
 Yup, that looks easier to follow. Thanks. :) -- Golden Key  ( talk  •  contribs ) 19:21, February 25, 2013 (UTC) 
 What is the meaning behind the letter "R? 
 Does "R' stand for "Revenge" since the main antagonist, Yako Tenma is trying to seek revenge toward the main protagonist, Yami Yugi, for defeating his adoptive father Maximillion Pegasus during the Duelist Kingdom arc?
 Superarc1  ( talk  •  contribs ) 06:00, May 19, 2014 (UTC)
 
 It's hinted to stand for "Rebirth." Yako's R.A. Project's full name is the "Rebirth of Avatar" Project.  Sanokal K-T  ( talk  •  contribs ) 06:14, May 19, 2014 (UTC)
