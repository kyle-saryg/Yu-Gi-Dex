 Sense Upon Sense...!! 
 
 "Equip Vs. Equip!!"  is the twenty-fourth chapter of the  Yu-Gi-Oh! 5D's  manga .
 This chapter was first printed on July 21, 2011 in the 09/2011 issue of the  V Jump  magazine. It was later reprinted in  volume 3  of the  tankōbon .
 
 Summary 
 Yusei  continues his  Duel  against  Leo  and  Luna . However, the twins' power is more than what he expected. Yusei is pushed into a corner by Leo's  Duel Dragon , but suddenly, something happens on Yusei's mind when it attacks him...!
 
 Featured Duel: Yusei Fudo vs. Leo and Luna 
 Duel continues from  the previous Ride . 
 Leo  equips  " Power Tool Mecha Dragon " with the  Equip Spell  " Pile Arm ", increasing its  ATK  by 500 (2300 → 2800), and destroying Yusei's  face-down  " Junk Shield ". He then  attacks  " Junk Blader " with "Power Tool", destroying it (Yusei 3700 → 2700).
 Turn 4: Yusei Fudo 
Yusei  Special Summons  " Junk Forward " (900/1500) from his  hand  as his opponent controls a monster and he does not. He then  Normal Summons  " Junk Changer " (1500/900) and activates its  effect , increasing its own  Level  by 1, from 3 to 4. He then tunes his 2 monsters to  Synchro Summon  " Seven Swords Warrior " (2300/1800). He activates " Blade Graveyard " and equips it to "Seven Swords Warrior", but Leo activates "Power Tool Mecha Dragon's" effect, equipping that card to it instead, which increases its ATK by 800 (2800 → 3600) and allows him to  draw  one card. Yusei then activates the Spell " Sword Dance ", inflicting 100 damage to Leo times "Seven Swords Warrior's" level (Leo and Luna 3000 → 2300). Yusei  Sets  1 card.
 Turn 5: Leo and Luna 
Leo activates the Spell " All Zero " from his hand, Special Summoning " Bat, The Forest Ninja ", " Pon, The Forest Merchant ", " Con, The Forest Schemer " and " Nyanto, The Forest Traveler  ", all with their ATK and DEF reduced to 0, and with their effects negated. He activates " Tool Box 's" effect again, adding a random Equip Spell card from his  Deck  to his hand; he gets " Morphtronic Master Arm " and equips it to "Power Tool Mecha Dragon", increasing its ATK by 300 for each  face-up  " Morphtronic " monster he  controls . Due to the  Continuous Trap Card  " Morphtronicize ", all face-up Level 4 or lower monsters he controls are treated as Morphtronic monsters, so "Power Tool's" ATK increases by 1200 (3600 → 4800). Leo  attacks  "Seven Swords Warrior" with "Power Tool Mecha Dragon".
 Duel continues  in the next Ride .
