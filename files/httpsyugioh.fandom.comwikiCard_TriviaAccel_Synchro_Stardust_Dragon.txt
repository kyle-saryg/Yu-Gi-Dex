 The card's name refers to the  Accel Synchro Summon  and how " Stardust Dragon " is often used by  Yusei Fudo  in that summon. 
 The artwork shows Yusei and his  Signature card  moving fast while preforming the  Clear Mind  and Accel Synchro Summon.
 Fittingly the effects involves a quick Synchro Summon combo.
