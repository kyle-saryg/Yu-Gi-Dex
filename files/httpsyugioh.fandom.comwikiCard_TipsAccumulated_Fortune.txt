 This card can be searched by " A Cat of Ill Omen ", " Primathmech Alembertian ", " Trap Trick " and " Lilith, Lady of Lament ". 
 To activate this card without losing card advantage, and accounting for only your cards, at least two of the cards in the Chain must be  Quick-like  effects that, if they activate in the hand or on the field, do not move to the Graveyard, Deck or  Banished Zone  unless they are draw, search or recovery cards.
 If one of the cards in the Chain is activated by your opponent and would leave the hand or field in the process, then this card will generate card advantage regardless of your other cards in the Chain. 
 If either player activates " Chain Hole ", you will be able to Chain this card in response. 
 This card fits perfectly in a " Chain Strike " OTK deck, as the Deck is capable of creating long Chains with different card names to fulfill this card's activation requirement. In addition, this card's draw effect is strongly appreciated by the Deck as it tends to use up its hand very quickly.
