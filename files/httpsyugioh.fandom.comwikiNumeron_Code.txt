 The  Numeron Code  (ヌメロンコード,  Numeron Kōdo ) is a powerful card which created all of reality in the  Yu-Gi-Oh! ZEXAL  anime. It has records of everything in the universe and has the power to decide the fate of all reality.
 
 Story 
 The Code was created as the result of a tear shed by the  dragon that created the universe  impacting with  Earth . This also created the moon, where the key to the Code ended up. The correlation between these events was inscribed on a  tablet . [1] 
 Finding the Code is the primary objective of both the  Barian World [1]  and  Astral World . [2]  Each aims to find the Code in order to destroy the other. Astral knew where the Code was prior to going to Earth, but upon arriving his memories were scattered in the form of the  Numbers . Since gathering all of the Numbers would reveal the location of the Code within Astral's memories, both him and the Barians plan to  collect the "Numbers"  before the other side does.
 Seven specific "Numbers"  hidden within ruins can aid in finding the Code without obtaining all of the Numbers. [3] [2]  In addition, the  tablet  details that the two " Galaxy-Eyes " dragons must meet on the Moon and battle. The victor will be awarded the  key  to the Code. [1] 
 
       Astral  explains the Numeron Code to Yuma.     
 After  Yuma Tsukumo  and  Astral 's Duel with the  Shadow Giant  where  The Door  allowed Yuma Tsukumo and Astral to access more of Astral's memories, they learned that Astral's original mission was to find the Numeron Code - the "God Card" that created the world and can decide fate. He must find it before the  Barians  do. He also learned that the location of the code was hidden in the memories of the 7  Mythyrian "Numbers"  he has yet to collect. Astral intends to use it in order to find the locations of uncollected " Number " cards. [4] 
 The Code is shown to be a card that swirls around into different forms in Astral's memories. Inside it is how the world developed and where it is heading to. The " Numeron " archetype is related to the Code and emulates its powers. [5] [2] [6] 
 Once Astral obtained all of the "Numbers", he quickly found the Numeron Code intending to fulfill his mission of destroying the  Barian World , but Yuma protested against Astral using it for more destruction. Astral challenged Yuma to a final Duel to resolve the problem of how the Code will be utilized. [7] 
 After his last Duel with Yuma, Astral finally obtained access to the Numeron Code and used its powers to revive  Kite Tenjo , the  Seven Barian Emperors  (they were returned back into their true human forms),  Ponta  and  Eliphas  in order to restore peace to the universe. [8]  According to Eliphas, Astral fused the Barian World and the Astral World using the reality warping artifact. This also allowed  Chaos  to return, causing upcoming challenges to take place. [8] [8]
