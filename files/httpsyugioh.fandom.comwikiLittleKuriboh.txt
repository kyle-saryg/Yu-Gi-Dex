 Biography 
 Online 
 LittleKuriboh started a LiveJournal (Little Kuriboh's Dan Marino) where he stated in his first entry that he's "nobody special" and that he is a little ashamed of his love for  Yu-Gi-Oh! . He later began creating and uploading anime music videos on  YouTube . Soon afterward he created  Yu-Gi-Oh: The Abridged Series . LittleKuriboh was not listed among the top subscribed channels although his subscribers count was high enough to earn a spot. After having his channel restored after his first ban, he was included on this list.
 As an April Fool's Day joke in 2008, LittleKuriboh announced the cancellation of  The Abridged Series .
 Aside from  Yu-Gi-Oh: The Abridged Series , LittleKuriboh also does voice acting in the  machinima   Eden: The Zhang Chronicles  and has lent his voice to the  Naruto  abridged series. He was the narrator for episode 4 of  Dragon Ball Z: The Abridged Series ; this was the first time he has provided a guest voice where the cameo wasn't specifically referred to. He appears to narrate the series in several episodes, as well as providing the voice for Frieza, one of the main villains of the series. He has stated he will continue to do what the makers want him to do. LittleKuriboh also voices  Sugoroku Mutou  in Project YGO's fandub of  Yu-Gi-Oh! Duel Monsters . He has also made a cameo appearance in the  Go Go Parody Rangers  film, where he plays one of Evan Splooge's rat henchmen. He is also a creator of a second  Naruto  abridged series called  Naruto The Abridged Comedy Spoof Series Show , or  NINJABRIDGED  for short. He has also appeared as  Haru Tsukumo  in  Yu-Gi-Oh: Zexal-Abridged .
 He has also made various charity actions by using money he got from promoting through a video with various  Yu-Gi-Oh!  trading cards that he auctioned off.
 He is also known for promoting various anime conventions through his videos by creating stories using the  Yu-Gi-Oh: The Abridged Series  universe.
 
 Account suspensions 
 YouTube began taking down some of LittleKuriboh's videos for copyright infringement, leading him to set up new pages and an account on  Dailymotion . In response to the first  Abridged Series  episode being taken down, he posted a live performance of episode one. Using no clips to avoid copyright infringement, the video consisted of him voicing the entire episode, and this allowed fans to see what he looked like for the first time. Shortly after creating the  Abridged Movie , LittleKuriboh had his account suspended on YouTube. Soon afterward it was reinstated, and LittleKuriboh was moved to the top subscribed lists, which he had been previously excluded from.
 Shortly after posting a video in which he proposed, his account was suspended again.
 On December 23, 2010, his CardGamesFTW YouTube channel was terminated. His next video was posted on his Ninjabridge channel. CardGamesFTW was later reinstated in January 2011, because the copyright claims were from a bot. The account was suspended later on February 26, 2011.
