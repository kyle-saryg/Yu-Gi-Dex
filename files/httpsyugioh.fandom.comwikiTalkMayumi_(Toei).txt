 (First series?) 
 As far as I know there isn't any other incarnation of Mayumi in the other Yu-Gi-Oh! continuities.  Did one of the newer Animes make an alternate universe version of her?  Because if not then I feel that the first series headline is unneeded since Mayumi only exists in one continuity so shouldn't the page simply be called Mayumi?

 There is a character in  Yu-Gi-Oh! ZEXAL  named Mayumi, who the dub called  May . Prior to that dub name being revealed the "(first series)" was necessary. It probably isn't now.  Cheesedude  ( talk  â€¢  contribs ) 00:11, February 24, 2013 (UTC)
