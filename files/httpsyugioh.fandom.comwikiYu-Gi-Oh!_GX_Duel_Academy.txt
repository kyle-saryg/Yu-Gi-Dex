 Gameplay 
 The objective is to advance through the game, following the anime. Mainly, you come to  Duel Academy  to become the King of Games. At first, you will be in  Slifer Red  Dorm with dropout boy ranks. You have to Duel and test in order to achieve a higher dorm and rank. When you win  duels , you will get DP for buying  booster packs  in order to improve your Deck and skills. This game follows the story of the first season of the  Yu-Gi-Oh! GX  anime.
 
 Earning DP 
 DP (Duelist Points) can be earned by winning Duels and can be used to purchase new cards. Upon winning a duel, DP is rewarded as follows:
 
 100 DP for winning by reducing your opponents LP to 0
 another 1 DP for every 100 LP your opponent lost during the duel 
 another 1 DP for every 100 battle damage dealt to your opponent 
 another 50 DP for each of your opponent's monsters destroyed by battle 
 500 DP for winning with  Exodia  or by deck out 
 1000 DP for winning with  Final Countdown 
 3000 DP for winning with  Destiny Board 
 Reward is halved if you win in more than 40 turns. 
 Reward is doubled if you win in less than 7 turns. 
 Reward is multiplied by 5 if you win in less than 5 turns. 
 Reward is multiplied by 10 if you win on turn 2 going second. 
 Change Activation Timing 
 This feature enables you to prevent the game to ask you if you want to activate a card's effect in every possible situation. i.e. you can to choose only to be asked to activate "Scapegoat" during the opponent's Battle Phase. Therefore, choose "option" in the PDA screen and choose "Confirm Activation" to be manual. Now if you select a card while in the Deck construction menu you see an extra icon for the activation timing of this card. If you choose this icon you can unselect all cases with the L-button and then only select the activation times you want.
