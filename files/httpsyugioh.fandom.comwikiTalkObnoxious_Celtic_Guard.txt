 We already have  an image of that version . We use the SD5 version on this article, because the policy is to use the most recent English print. --  Deltaneos  ( talk ) 18:04, March 13, 2010 (UTC) 
 "Retrained?" 
 "翻弄する" does not mean retrained. It means "to make fun of" or "to trifle." Probably a better translation would be something like "Mocking Elf Swordsman." Just putting that out there. -- Kahran042  ( talk  •  contribs ) 05:57, March 6, 2013 (UTC)
