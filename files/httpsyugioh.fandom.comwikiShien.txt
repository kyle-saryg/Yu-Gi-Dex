 " Shien " ( 紫 炎   Shien ) is an  archetype  of cards related to the " Six Samurai " and " Legendary Six Samurai ", through " Gateway of the Six " and " Shien's Dojo ". The Japanese  effect  text for those two cards specifies all cards in the "Shien" archetype must have 「紫炎」 in their Japanese names, with 「 シ エン」 as furigana. For this reason, " Kagemusha of the Blue Flame " (" Shien's Body Double ") is a "Shien" card, while " Shien's Spy " is not.
 " Barrier Ninjitsu Art of Transcription ", " Blind Spot Strike ", " Spy Attack " and " Debunk " suggests that " Ninjas " have some sort of rivalry with the "Shien". 
 Some of the monsters are monkeys that aid the "Six Samurai" and the archetype as a whole largely serves as  support  cards for the "Six Samurai".
 " Elder of the Six Samurai " is believed to be the older version of " Shien's Advisor " and " Shien's Daredevil " due to the the mug with the Shien symbol on it, appearing in both the Elder's and Advisor's artworks.
 "Shien" literally means "Purple Flame", so in the artworks of most "Shien" cards, there are visible purple/blue flames.
