 This section, or a part of it, has been transcluded from  Yu-Gi-Oh! ZEXAL - Volume 001 ; any changes involving it should be made  there  instead.  /  
 In a futuristic city, augmented reality Duels are all the rage. Duelists, using devices called D-Gazers, can interact and with their environment and their opponents as never before. With more awesome monsters and unbelievable cards, the future of Yu-Gi-Oh! starts right here! [1] 
 Numbers Hunter!! 
 Kaito finds out that the only way to help his brother return to normal is to collect all one hundred Numbers Cards. The power these cards give to the Duelist who wields them is immense, and many other Duelists are seeking them. Yuma must face these "Numbers Hunters", starting with the mysterious Kaito! [2] 
 
 Previously… 
 Yuma tackles every challenge that comes his way, and he doesn't give up. Although his skills are suspect, he's crazy about dueling! 
 One day, Yuma's rival Tetsuo has his deck stolen by Shark, the school's biggest delinquent and duelist, a Yuma ends up dueling Shark. During the duel, the charm Yuma's parents gave him opens a mysterious door, and a strange being called Astral appears!! 
 Astral is a genius duelist, but only Yuma can see him. Astral's lost memories have become special cards called "Numbers." Shark uses one of the Numbers cards to duel Yuma into a corner, but Yuma's doggedness and Astral's strategies earn them a win! 
 Now Yuma is determined to become Duel Champion, and Astral is trying to collect the Numbers and take back his memories! [2]

 Message from Kazuki Takahashi 
 "ZEXAL" is created by the mightiest team ever—Mr. Yoshida doing the story, Mr. Miyoshi doing the art—and I think it's awesome! [2] 
 
 Message from Shin Yoshida 
 The "ZEXAL" manga is finally heading into its own original storyline. Yuma and Astral are just a bit different from their anime counterparts. I hope you'll keep routing for them. [2] 
 
 Message from Naohito Miyoshi 
 Wow. "ZEXAL" has been running for a year already… It went fast. I like my job even when it's really busy, and that makes me a lucky guy! I'm gonna keep working hard! [2]
