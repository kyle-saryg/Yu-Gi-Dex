 Events 
 During the night after the first day of preliminaries at the  Duelist Kingdom  tournament, the  Eliminator , PaniK searched  the island  for participants to eliminate from the tournament.
 When Mai was alone, PaniK snuck up on her and forced her into a Duel, where she had to bet all eight of her  Star Chips .
 Panik made use of the  Darkness  to hide his monsters and easily overpower Mai.
 Yugi, Joey, Téa, Tristan and Bakura heard Mai screaming and ran to the Duel. PaniK explained how Mai had been eliminated and that  Maximillion Pegasus  had listed taking out Yugi as a priority. Yugi then switched to  Yami Yugi , who  Dueled  PaniK to win back Mai's Star Chips.
