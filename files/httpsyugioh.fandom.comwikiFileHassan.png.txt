 In  Dawn of the Duel , he was  Yami Yugi 's "master item" during the  Dark RPG  against  Yami Bakura . Hassan appeared before Atem after he had fallen into a chasm. He advised him to rest and left. Later, when  Aknadin  became the Great Shadow Magus, he intercepted one of his attacks and redirected it to  Yami Bakura's   Hourglass Token  that froze time, thus destroying it and making time move again. He later perished at the hands of  Zorc Necrophades , protecting the Pharaoh and his guards. Shadi later possessed his body and died again. Hasan was among those in the Spirit Realm waiting for Atem.
