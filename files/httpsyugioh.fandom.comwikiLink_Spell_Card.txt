 Link Spell Cards  (Japanese: リンク 魔 法 カード  Rinku Majikku Kādo ) are a type of  Spell Card  exclusive to the anime. Like  Equip  and  Continuous Spell Cards , they remain on the field after activation. Uniquely, a Link Spell Card possesses functioning  Link Arrows  like Link Monsters, which allows Extra Deck monsters to be summoned at any  Main Monster Zones  they point to.
 In the anime, they can only be activated in a Spell & Trap Zone pointed to by a Link Monster. Like Link Monsters, a Link Spell Card can be used to form an  Extra Link .
 While the only known example is " Judgment Arrows ", " Armatos Legio Plumbum Trident 's" effect can turn itself into a Link Spell Card.
