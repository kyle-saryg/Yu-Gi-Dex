 Playing style 
 The Crystrons focus on swarming the field with monsters to  Synchro Summon . The  Tuners   Special Summon  Non-Tuner monsters and share the quick Synchro effect with " Formula Synchron ", " Accel Synchron ", and the " Yang Zing " monsters, while the Non-Tuners Special Summon the Tuner Monsters. 
 The  Synchro Monsters  of this archetype are rather unique in their Summoning. " Crystron Phoenix " is an  Accel Synchro Monster , while " Crystron Quariongandrax " must be Summoned through  Double Tuning ; making "Crystrons" the first known archetype to include members that can be Summoned through both of these methods. All of the "Crystron" Synchro Monsters Special Summon other monsters when they are destroyed; usually from the  Graveyard  (with the exception of "Quariongandrax"), while all of the non-Tuner Synchro Monsters have effects that activate when they are Synchro Summoned. The effects of "Phoenix" and "Quariongandrax" both focus on banishing large numbers of cards the opponent controls or that they have in the Graveyard.
