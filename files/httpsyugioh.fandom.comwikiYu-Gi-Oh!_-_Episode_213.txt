 "Village of Vengeance - Part 5" , known as  "Countdown to the Evil God's Resurrection"  in the Japanese version, is the two-hundred and thirteenth episode of the  Yu-Gi-Oh!  second series anime.  It aired in Japan on July 14, 2004 and in the US on February 4, 2006.
 Thief King Bakura  tries to persuade  Priest Seto  to join his side. Meanwhile,  Seto Kaiba  arrives in the memory world. 
 
 Summary 
 Thief King Bakura  has just been revived!. He takes over where  Aknadin /" Great Dark Priest " had left off, namely attempt to convince  Priest Seto  to pledge his allegiance to  Zorc . 
 Meanwhile  Kisara  is still trying to locate  Priest Seto  to prevent him from joining the evil and making a big mistake.
 At this point, Thief King Bakura summons " Diabound " again. Its  Stone Tablet  was  destroyed , but thanks to the power of all the  Millennium Items , Bakura does not need a tablet anymore. In addition, the Items have made "Diabound" stronger than ever.
 Aknadin makes one final attempt to convince his son to join Zorc, while  Isis ,  Shada ,  Shimon Muran  and  the Pharaoh  urge him not to listen. At this point, having had enough of the  Sacred Guardians ' meddling, Aknadin opens a dark portal and throws Priest Seto into it. He follows shortly after. The Pharaoh tries to get in as well, but Bakura's "Diabound" prevents him.  Thief King Bakura  snaps his fingers and the ground starts shaking. The  Tablet of the Realm of the Dead  retreats into the ground and tenebrosity fills the room.
 Back at the Egyptian capital,  Seto Kaiba  has just woken up. He thinks this may just be a dream or a hallucination, but he soon realizes it is not when 2 children pass right through him as if he were immaterial. He then comes across  Kisara , who is still searching for Priest Seto. Kaiba remembers her as the girl he saw in his vision from when  Ishtar  brought the  Tablet of Lost Memories  to Japan. He is surprised to find that Kisara can see him.
 Back at  Kul Elna , Thief King Bakura's magic has transported the Priests back to the surface and they have now been separated from one another, in groups. Shimon Muran and Shada have to fight " Cobraman Sakuzy ". Shada summons " Two-Headed Jackal Warrior " to assist him and he promptly gets rid of the monster. Isis and Karim have to fight " Giant Axe Mummy ". Isis summons " Spiria ", but her monster is quickly dispatched. The Pharaoh and Hassan have to deal with " Swarm of Scarabs ". Mana is dealing with an " Skeleton Fiend ". To help her, she summons " Dark Magician Girl ".
 Eventually, Shimon Muran and Shada join up with Isis and Karim, just as Isis receives a fatal blow from the monster she's battling. Since he is too weak to be of any assistance, Karim transfers his remaining  ba  to Shada. "Two-Headed Jackal Warrior" grows more powerful as a result and gets rid of the monster  attacking  Isis. As the monster is destroyed, the Pharaoh, Hassan and Mana arrive.
 The Pharaoh has seen enough: He tells Hassan to stay here and protect the others, while he mounts his horse and departs to find Priest Seto.
 Back at the " Valley of the Kings ",  Yugi  and his friends have entered the ancient tomb where  Solomon Muto  found the  Millennium Puzzle  originally. They cannot pass through walls here. Just like when Grandpa Muto came here, the place is still loaded with traps. Yugi and his friends must be careful.
 One by one, they get past all the traps (the " Needle-Spitting Snake Statues ", the " Maze Across the Pit of Obscurity " and " The Monster Bridge "). As they reach the room where the  Millennium Puzzle  was stored, they seem to be at a dead end. However  Joey  casually leans against a pressure-sensitive panel on the wall and activates a secret door.
