 Xyz Materials  (pronounced ik-seez [1] ) (Japanese: エクシーズ 素 材   Ekushīzu Sozai ; usually abbreviated  Ｘ 素 材  since  Duelist Alliance ), are cards stacked underneath an  Xyz Monster . They are known as  Overlay Units  (オーバーレイ・ユニット,  Ōbārei Yunitto ), abbreviated  ORU , in the anime and manga.
 When an  Xyz Monster  is  Xyz Summoned , the  monsters  used for the Xyz Summon are stacked underneath the Summoned Xyz Monster. The attached Xyz Materials do not occupy a  Zone .
 Many Xyz Monsters have  effects  that require  detaching  Xyz Materials ( sending  an Xyz Material attached to that Xyz Monster to the  Graveyard ) as an activation  cost . If the Xyz Monster is no longer in a  Monster Zone , any Xyz Materials that were attached to that Xyz Monster are sent to the Graveyard.
 Some card effects allow  attaching  cards to Xyz Monsters as Xyz Materials (placing them underneath the Xyz Monster) through means other than Xyz Summon. Some card effects allow cards to be attached as Xyz Materials (such as " Xyz Reborn ", " Overlay Regen " and " Number 101: Silent Honor ARK ").
 Unlike the terms  Fusion Material Monster  and  Synchro Material Monster , the term "Xyz Material Monster" was never used. In addition, since July 2017, most instances of effects unambigously referring to Xyz Materials now simply say "material".

 Rulings 
 Xyz Materials underneath Xyz Monsters do not count as monsters, so detached Xyz Materials will be sent to the Graveyard even if " Dimensional Fissure " is on the field. While monsters are acting as Xyz Materials, they cannot be  targeted  nor apply their effects.
 Xyz Materials are not treated as being on the  field , [2]  and also being attached as an Xyz Material is not considered to be the card  leaving the field . Therefore, when an Xyz Material is attached or detached, any effects of the Xyz Material that only activate when it  leaves the field  (such as " Reborn Tengu ") do not activate.  Token Monsters  cannot be used as Xyz Materials, because Xyz Materials are attached to the Xyz Monster and attached Xyz Materials are not considered to be on the field. 
 Even when  attaching Xyz Materials with a card effect , Xyz Materials can only be attached to Xyz Monsters (e.g. " Phantom of Chaos " that has copied the effect of " Number C101: Silent Honor DARK " cannot activate the effect to attach a card as an Xyz Material). Likewise, even with a card effect, Token Monsters cannot be attached as Xyz Materials.
 
 Historical rulings 
 Before it was clarified that Xyz Materials cannot be on the field, as an interim ruling, the  TCG  ruled that they were on the field (whereas the  OCG  consistently ruled that they were not). [3] 
 
 In the anime 
           An  ATK  gauge from  ZEXAL  showing the number of Overlay Units.     
 In  Yu-Gi-Oh! ZEXAL  and  Yu-Gi-Oh! ARC-V , as previously noted, Xyz Materials are instead called  Overlay Units , and are depicted as orbs of light orbiting the body of the Xyz Monster, and glow with the color associated to the Xyz Monster's  Attribute  (e.g. LIGHT Xyz Monsters have yellow Overlay Units). Additionally, during an Xyz Summon, the cards to be used as Xyz Material light up with the color associated of their own Attribute before briefly spiraling around each other and entering a bright swirl of energy called  Overlay Network . 
 Uniquely, the Xyz Materials of " CXyz " monsters and " Number C " monsters (alongside  Number iC1000: Numeronius Numeronia ) used by  Barians  are depicted as magenta crystals that float stationary in front of or behind the monster, often lined up in a row. These crystals contain white orbs of light. "Cxyz" materials are smaller with silver plates when not in a Barian area, and "Number C" materials are bigger with black trimmed gold plates. "Cxyz" materials become the latter when within a Barian area. These are named  Chaos Overlay Units  (abbreviated as " CORU ").
 In  Yu-Gi-Oh! VRAINS , Xyz Materials are orange and are made of data. They now spin in a circle behind the monster's back.
 In  ZEXAL , when the player detaches Xyz Materials for their respective Xyz Monster's effect, the monster in question is shown to absorb them through several methods, such being eaten with their mouth or striking a weapon they carry. In some cases, the Xyz Monster will glow with the Attribute color for a few moments before unleashing the effect. When instead detached by another card's effect, the Units are drawn away from their orbit and dragged inside a purple  Graveyard  portal.
 In  ARC-V , Xyz Materials are still usually absorbed by the Xyz Monster, but sometimes they are instead flung in another direction. A recurring example is the anime effect of " Raidraptor - Rise Falcon ", which allows it to gain the total ATK of all opponent monsters that were Special Summoned; to symbolize this, the used Material is sent flying towards the field of the other player(s). However, in general these animated effects tend to be much less elaborate than in  ZEXAL , often simply causing the Material to disintegrate while still in its orbital path. In  VRAINS , the Xyz Materials just disintegrate into data.
 In the anime, some cards allowed monsters to be  treated as more than 1 monster  for an Xyz Summon (for example,  Photon Caesar ). This mechanic was most likely dropped for the TCG and OCG to avoid gameplay issues. The cards in question ended up as either  Anime-only  cards or had their effect changed to mimic this mechanic, usually by  Special Summoning copies of themselves  from hand or Deck.
