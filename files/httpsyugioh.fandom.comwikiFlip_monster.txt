 Flip monsters  (Japanese: リバースモンスター  Ribāsumonsutā  "Reverse Monster"), formerly  Flip Effect Monsters  (リバース 効 果 モンスター  Ribāsu Kōka Monsutā  "Reverse Effect Monster"), are  Effect Monsters  with the  ability  "Flip". With the exception of  Deus X-Krawler , they all have a  Flip effect , although they may also have other effects in addition to their Flip effect.
 Previously, Flip Effects (as they were capitalized at the time) were a type of card effect like  Trigger  and  Ignition Effects , with Flip Effects being able to be identified by the text "FLIP:" at the start of the effect; Flip Effect Monsters were simply monsters that had a Flip Effect. Starting in  Starter Deck 2014  (in the  OCG ) and  Super Starter: Space-Time Showdown  (in the  TCG ),  Flip  is treated as an  ability  and the word "Flip" is written on the cards'  Type /Ability line.
 Flip monsters usually have a low Level, and often have low  ATK  and  DEF .
 The " Charmer ", " Krawler ", " Prediction Princess ", " Shaddoll ", " Subterror ", " Tindangle " and " Worm "  archetypes  are primarily based on Flip monsters.
 Flip monsters can also be  Tuner monsters  or  Pendulum Monsters .

 Flip effects 
 Main article:  Flip effect 
 A Flip effect is a type of  Trigger Effect  that is preceded by "FLIP:". This kind of effect meets its activation timing when the Flip monster on the  field  is  flipped  from  face-down  to a  face-up , even during the  Damage Step .
 Some monsters have effects with the timing  "when this card is flipped face-up"  (unofficially called  Pseudo-Flip Effects ), such as " Snowman Eater ", which, while mechanically identical, are distinct from Flip effects.
 When a face-down Flip monster is  attacked , during  damage calculation  the monster is flipped face-up, then it is determined whether or not the monster is  destroyed by battle . During the  Damage Step , after  damage calculation  but before being sent to the  Graveyard  if it was destroyed by battle, the Flip monster's Flip effect activates and resolves on the field, if the timing is correct.
 If a  card effect   destroys  a face-down Flip monster, its Flip effect cannot be activated since it is not flipped face-up.

 Trivia 
 There are currently no  Dinosaur  or  Fish -Type Flip monsters. 
 Flip monsters are rarely used in the anime; in the anime, prior to  Yu-Gi-Oh! ZEXAL , it was legal to  Normal Summon  a monster in  face-up   Defense Position , and monsters were rarely  Set . 
 " Performapal Momoncarpet " is the only  Pendulum  Flip monster. 
 The only characters to have a Deck based on Flip monsters are (the appropriately-named)  Flip Turner  from Yu-Gi-Oh! ZEXAL,  Aura Sentia  from  Yu-Gi-Oh! ARC-V  and  Akira Zaizen  from  Yu-Gi-Oh! VRAINS . 
 " Subterror Behemoth Ultramafus " has the highest Level and original ATK of all Flip monsters, being Level 12 with 3000 ATK. 
 " Deus X-Krawler ," " Pot of The Forbidden ," and " Subterror Behemoth Voltelluric " have the highest  DEF  of all Flip monsters, with 3000 DEF. 
 The  illegal  card " Masahiro the Dark Clown " is the only Flip monster to have flavor text.
 It is also the only  illegal  Flip monster in the  OCG  (there are no illegal Flip monsters in the  TCG ).
