 Haluna , known as  Haruka  in the Japanese and Italian versions and  Haddy  in the German dub, is a little girl in  Yu-Gi-Oh! 5D's .
 
 Biography 
 Haluna is first seen at the same  hospital  where  Akiza Izinski  was taken after her crash. They were both watching the severe thunderstorm occurring in  New Domino City . When a lightning struck near them, she screamed in panic and dropped her cards. Akiza calms her by talking to her about Duel Monsters.
 Later after a tornado forms and envelops the city, the hospital windows themselves get broken because of the strong wind currents. As Haluna's cards get blown away, Haluna puts herself in danger and is blown outside. As Haluna dangles from the hospital's stairways, Akiza risks her life for her and is able to save her before she is blown away again.
 In episode 150, she cheers on Yusei.
 She later appears in episode 152 where her doctor says she may be able to leave earlier than expected, just then Akiza comes in and congratulates her for her recovery Harluna thanks Akiza for always supporting her and says she is the reason she got so better, Akiza then insists that it wasn't her but the doctors who helped her and she thanks them.
