 Summary 
 The Duel 
 Yusei continues his  Turbo Duel  with Greiger. Greiger's strategy seems to keep Yusei on the ropes. Yusei draws " Turbo Booster " during the Duel, reminding him of  Rally . Greiger later plays " Chariot Pile ", the card which  Lazar  gave him before the Duel. This causes some spikes to protrude from the wheel of the  Duel Runner . Regardless, through various combos Yusei turns the Duel around, swiftly winning.
 
 Greiger's Revelation 
 Leo  is surprised to see that "Chariot Pile" is still attached to Greiger's Duel Runner.  Goodwin  is disappointed that Yusei still hasn't revealed himself as a Signer.  Jack  gets up to leave, stating that Greiger's mission ran shallow after all.
 After the  MC  declares Yusei the winner, Yusei rides over to check on Greiger. Greiger rises up and holds his hand to his face in a manner similar to if he was holding a microphone. At the same time the MC's microphone stops working. Greiger's voice is heard from the speakers throughout the stadium, as he announces that Goodwin is responsible for the annihilation of his entire village. This sparks Jack's attention. Greiger draws up the images of his village and its destruction on the overhead monitors. Lazar demands that they halt the imagery, but Goodwin says to leave it.
 Lazar is astonished that Greiger knows of this destruction and considers that there may have been a survivor, and that Greiger has been able to override the airwaves. Jack is shocked by the sight of the destruction left by Rex's experiment to summon the  Crimson Dragon .
 
 Assault on Goodwin 
       Greiger  and  Yusei  clash in midair.     
 Greiger then calls to Yusei and Jack, telling them that they can't expect to win by playing by Goodwin's rules. He then hops on his Duel Runner, picks up speed racing around the circuit and ramps towards Goodwin's tower. Yusei speeds on his own Duel Runner in the opposite direction, colliding with Greiger's Runner and manages to knock him off course. The spike from "Chariot Pile" breaks off and crashes towards Rex Goodwin's tower. Rex grabs the spinning spike in one hand. The impact tears up his glove, revealing he has a mechanical hand. Lazar falls to the floor in shock, while Jack looks at Rex in disgust.
 Greiger gets up and seizes Yusei, demanding to know why he stopped him. Yusei replies that he's not pleased at what Goodwin has done either, but settling things by force would have made Greiger just as bad as Goodwin. Greiger releases Yusei and lets out a scream.

Yusei relies on his draw from the effect of " Tuning Supporter ".

The final effect of "Armory Arm" then activates, inflicting damage to Greiger equal to his destroyed monster's ATK (Greiger 1900 → 0).
 Differences in adaptations 
 In the dub, Tanner bet Dexter a corn dog that Yusei would use " Mirror Force ". 
 In the Japanese version, Greiger heard his family was killed in his room while in the dub, he heard it in Rex's office. 
 In the Japanese version, a lady told Greiger his family was killed. In the dub, it was a man, and rather than telling him his family was killed, he is transmitting a signal to Goodwin in his office. 
 In the Japanese version, when Yusei and Bommer fall down advertisements appear. They are removed from the dub. 
 A close up scene of Rex Goodwin with a serious expression after Lazar questions him about Greiger, is cut from the dub. 
 In the dub, after changing expression to anger, Jack asks in a surprised voice, "How are you doing that?" while Rex is still trying to stop the spike. Not only does this conflict with his expression, he said "Your hand" in the Japanese version. 
 In the original after Yusei stops Greiger, Greiger yells in agony. In the dub Greiger instead yells out Rex Goodwin's name. 
 The English dub gives Greiger a microphone when he is telling Yusei about Goodwin after the Duel. 
 In the dub, when Yusei removed his "Shield Warrior" from play to save his Junk Synchron, he said that it prevented battle damage instead of preventing his monster from being destroyed. 
 Mistakes 
         A typo on one of the banners.     
 In both the original and dubbed versions of this episode, there was a typo on one of the banners in the background. 
 When Yusei destroyed " Limiter Break " with " Wasteland Tornado ", he called it "Limiter Burst". 
 In the dub, when Greiger ended his turn (the turn " Flying Fortress SKY FIRE " attacked and destroyed " Speed Warrior "), the screen with Greiger's picture flashed even though it was now Yusei's turn.
