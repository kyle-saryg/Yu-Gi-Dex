 Biography 
 The prisoner escaped from  Domino City Jail  with a stolen handgun after killing a guard. He held  Anzu Mazaki  hostage at  Burger World . After blindfolding her, he told  Yugi  to get him  Lucky Stripe  cigarettes and vodka. 
 When Anzu realized that Yugi was the one bringing the Prisoner cigarettes and vodka, she yelled at Yugi to stay away, telling him it was too dangerous. Angry, the prisoner slammed her down. 
 Yugi's distress at seeing Anzu being treated this way prompted  Dark Yugi  to emerge where he challenged him to the  one finger BATTLE! . The prisoner aimed his gun at Yugi and told him that he will die after he lights his cigarette. While the prisoner was pouring the vodka, Dark Yugi placed the lighter on his hand. Dark Yugi explained that the Russian vodka was 90% alcohol and that pulling the trigger would cause the lighter to fall into the glass. 
 The prisoner was horrified as his vodka overflowed and eventually poured onto him. As Dark Yugi leads Anzu away, he sighs in relief, causing the cigarette to drop from his mouth and ignite the vodka, setting the convict ablaze. As such, Anzu remained unaware that it was Dark Yugi who had saved her, believing to be some random stranger. She fell in love with him as a result.  [1] 
 The prisoner states that it was once written in a magazine that he was born under a lucky star, so a breakout would have been easy. In fact, his escape was based on his horoscope stating that everything he does will succeed. Ironically, it was this trait that led to his defeat, as upon Yugi and Anzu leaving, he sighs in relief at how lucky he is to still be alive — causing his cigarette to drop onto the alcohol. In addition, he states that he had been on death row, and it is from this that he learned that blindfolding a person causes them to stay silent out of fear, while being muted has the opposite effect. [1]
