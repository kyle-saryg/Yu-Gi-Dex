 Design 
 Personality 
 Franz is known to be an ambitious card designer who focuses on cards that have raw power. He is also known to get jealous and desires recognition, which led him to steal " Ra " in the first place.
 During his  Duel , Franz showed signs of megalomania and a superiority complex. Franz disrespected "Ra", calling himself the  Egyptian God Card  instead and  sacrificing  it to save himself, not caring at all about the card.
 
 Abilities 
       Franz's appearance after fusing with "Ra".     
 Franz was able to create the only card capable of binding an Egyptian God against its will, " Mound of the Bound Creator ". In addition, he is one of the very few  Duelists  shown to be able to fuse with their monsters, mimicking  Yami Marik  during  Battle City .
 
 Biography 
 History 
 Franz was hired by  Pegasus  to be a card designer ten years before the the  Genex Tournament . Franz was one of Pegasus' top card designers who was envious of  Chumley Huffington 's talents, seeing as his own designs are looked down upon because, as Pegasus declares, the cards Franz designed focused too much on power.
 Out of frustration and anger, he decides to steal the only copy of " The Winged Dragon of Ra " that Industrial Illusions had kept for testing purposes. [1] 
 
 Yu-Gi-Oh! GX 
 After doing so, he snuck his way into the  Genex Tournament  and manages to use  Ra " to defeat and critically injure two tournament  Duelists . Later on,  Pegasus  and  Jaden Yuki  encounter Franz, who challenges the former to a Duel but it is the latter who ultimately accepts.
 Jaden is able to  Summon  " Elemental Hero Neos " and " Elemental Hero Necroid Shaman " on his first  turn . However, Franz plays a combo to Summon "Ra" and controls it against its will, due to " Mound of the Bound Ceator ".
 Ultimately, Franz is defeated by Jaden, who uses " Necro Illusion " to use "Ra" against him, despite neither having the knowledge of Egyptian hieratic text nor "Mound of the Bound Creator" in play. In the end, Pegasus consoles Franz's defeat and Franz agrees to return "The Winged Dragon of Ra" and return to Industrial Illusions as a loyal employee. [1] 
 
 Deck 
 Franz runs a  Winged Dragon of Ra  Deck , which, like  Yami Marik  from the  Battle City  arc in  the previous series , focuses on Summoning " Ra " and using its  effects . However, the "Winged Dragon of Ra" card that he uses is a copy that  Industrial Illusions  re-created for research, as its prototype, which Pegasus stated contained the spirit of Ra itself, was destroyed at the end of the previous series.
