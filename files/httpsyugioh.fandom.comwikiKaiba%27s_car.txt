 Kaiba's car  was a red sportscar, based on a  Ferrari 360 , which  Seto Kaiba  used for a short period of time in the  anime .
 
 History 
 While Seto and  Mokuba Kaiba  were on their way to get to  Paradius  headquarters,  Orichalcos Soldiers  were loose across the world. The Kaibas went to a car dealership to get some quick transport. Mokuba picked out the car and the two of them got inside. The  salesman  tried stopping them, but Kaiba whipped out a checkbook and wrote a check for $500,000 (US) and sped off, leaving the salesman dumbfounded. [1] 
 One block from the Paradius headquarters, they were stopped by Orichalcos Soldiers and got out to fight. [2]  After defeating the soldiers, they went back into the car and continued to drive, but got out again when they met  Téa  and  Tristan . A swarm of rats with glowing red eyes ran towards the group, causing them to climb to safety on a fire escape, abandoning the car. [3]
