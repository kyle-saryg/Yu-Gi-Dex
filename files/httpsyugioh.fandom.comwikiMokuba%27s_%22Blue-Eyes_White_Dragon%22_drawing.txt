      The hand drawn "Blue-Eyes White Dragon".     
 At a young age,  Mokuba Kaiba  hand drew a " Blue-Eyes White Dragon " card for his brother,  Seto .
 When  Gozaburo  ordered  Hobson  to confiscate all of Seto's toys, Mokuba hid Seto's Deck in a hollowed out book, including the drawing. He also left a note saying that their new family couldn't take everything away from them.
 
       The English anime version.     
 In the original Japanese anime, Mokuba wrote the card's name in  hiragana , reflecting how at his then young age, he had not yet learned how to write in  katakana  or  kanji  (the script that the card's name is actually written in). In the dubbed anime, the text is removed.
