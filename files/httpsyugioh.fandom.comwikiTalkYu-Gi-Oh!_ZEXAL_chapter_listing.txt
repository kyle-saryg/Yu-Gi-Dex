 Automatic List 
 I don't know what's wrong with these "automatic lists", I think it'd be simpler just to add episodes and chapters manually. Nowadays everybody just wants technology, when I was young we didn't have any of that and was happy. OK just kidding a little. What I mean, using this list as example, is that we have pages for all chapters till 14. But this list shows only till chapter 7. Also, many information posted on chapter 7's page is not shown on this list (such as release date). This should be fixed, but I have no idea how :|.

 It sometimes takes a while to update. All those pages were created today. Try editing the page and hitting save without changing anything. That may jog your browser into displaying what it should.  Cheesedude  ( talk  •  contribs ) 01:05, January 24, 2012 (UTC) 
 As for "why", mostly because of convenience. If we can auto-generate these things, it means no one has to remember to update them manually with new information, and there's less of a chance for a formatting snafu to sneak in.  「 ディノ 奴 千？！ 」 ?  ·  ☎ Dinoguy1000  08:38, January 27, 2012 (UTC)
 Can we manually add the special chapter into the list? it is not possible for it to show up with SP1 episode code. - Lpoi  ( talk  •  contribs ) 14:03, February 1, 2012 (UTC) 
 Done. Forgot I hadn't done that.  Cheesedude  ( talk  •  contribs ) 15:17, February 1, 2012 (UTC)
 since the special is directly after chapter 7 in volume 1, why not do it this way:

 just a suggestion - Lpoi  ( talk  •  contribs ) 14:59, February 7, 2012 (UTC) 
 It doesn't follow the regular chronology though. In the special chapter, Yuma gets Hope while Dueling Kaito, which obviously doesn't happen in-canon, since he gets it when he Duels Shark. So it's a non-canon "what if?" type story.  Cheesedude  ( talk  •  contribs ) 16:33, February 7, 2012 (UTC)

 Is there anything we can do to make the "D Team ZEXAL chapter listing" stop appearing in the actual manga chapters as well?  LegenaryAsariUgetsu  ( talk  •  contribs ) 22:18, May 25, 2012 (UTC)
