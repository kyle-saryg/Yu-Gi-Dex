 Etymology 
 The name of this archetype, 「 六 花 」 Rikka , is a poetic word meaning "snow"; however, the kanji used are those for "six" and "flower", alluding to the usual six-pointed interpretation of a snowflake, which can resemble a six-leafed flower.
 
 Members 
 Except "Petal", Main Deck "Rikka" monsters ("Rikka Fairy") are named after cold-resistant flowering plants that originate from Europe and/or Africa, and seem to be organized in pairs of even Levels; the pairs' members have mirrored ATK and DEF compared to each other, and the one with higher ATK faces to the viewer's left while the one with higher DEF faces to the viewer's right. The Xyz Monsters ("Rikka Queen") are named after types of floral ornaments, have equal ATK and DEF, and physically resemble both members with the same Level as their respective Rank.

 Playing style 
 The main theme of this deck is tributing both players monsters as an extra cost to you or as a form of monster removal for your opponent. With the "Rikka" Spell and Trap lineup you have the option to  Tribute  a Plant monster or not to gain an extra benefit out of the card, such as " Rikka Glamour " allowing you add 2 cards instead of 1 or " Rikka Sheet " allowing you to not only stop the target from activating its effects; but also take control of it. The Deck also has a fair amount of Level manipulation allowing them to go into many even leveled  Xyz Monsters , but be wary because if you control a non-plant monster " Rikka Flurries " will destroy itself at the end of your opponents turns.
 The deck will attempt to control the board by summoning " Teardrop the Rikka Queen " which allows you to disrupt your opponents plays by tributing during either player's turn if it has a plant monster as  Xyz Material , or using "Rikka Sheet" to stop a key monster from activating its effect.
 The combination of Plant and WATER is very beneficial to this Deck as it allows them to use powerful cards such as " Aromaseraphy Jasmine ", " Moray of Greed ", and " Lonefire Blossom ".

 Weaknesses 
 Since "Rikka" archetype focuses on tributing monsters, several cards that can prevent tributing like " Mask of Restrict " can hinder this archetype's play.
 As this cards need a supports from WATER-attribute and Plant-type monsters, a cards like " DNA Surgery " and " DNA Transplant " can effectively slow down this archetype.
