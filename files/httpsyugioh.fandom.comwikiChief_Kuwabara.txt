 Biography 
 Battle City 
       Kuwabara, while the machines go haywire     
 Kuwabara was part of a team analyzing  Seto Kaiba 's  Duel  with the  Duel Machine , which was used to test the power of " The God of the Obelisk ". He voiced his suspicious that Kaiba would not be able to defeat the Duel Machine.  Mokuba Kaiba  scolded his lack of faith, but he explained that the machine was using Kaiba's  Duelist Kingdom  Deck, including the three " Blue-Eyes White Dragons ". When Kaiba Summoned Obelisk, Kuwabara was shocked to see it sacrifice its allies to use its power and again shocked to see the computers go haywire, as they could not take the power of "Obelisk". [2] 
 Kuwabara led a team, tasked with finding the location of the  Rare Hunters  with the remaining  God cards , for Kaiba. They used satellites to locate  Battle City  Duels, checked the  Duel Disk  registration numbers of participants and scanned their Decks. Kaiba checked in on Kuwabara for progress and instructed him to alert him as soon as they found them. [3] 
 
 Transcend Game 
 Kuwabara showcased the progress on "Operation  Neurons " to Kaiba. He explained that in order to collect data for the test versions, they accepted applications for test monitors and received over a million candidates. Out of them, they gathered around 200,000 Duelists under the age of fifteen, irrespective of race and faith, with network data in every branch of the country providing them with data around the clock. He proceeded to show Kaiba, the test subjects engaged in virtual reality Duels on the Crystal Cloud Network. Overall Kuwabara was impressed with the quality of the VR  Solid Vision , but Kaiba only considered it to be 50% complete. [4] 
 
 The Dark Side of Dimensions 
 Kuwabara was part of  a team of researchers , who worked on the  virtual Dark Yugi  reconstruction of  the pharaoh . Following Kaiba's  Duel  with him, they regarded the battle a success, but Kaiba was dissatisfied. Regardless of how accurate they had reconstructed the pharaoh, it was not the real thing, making it inadequate. [5]
