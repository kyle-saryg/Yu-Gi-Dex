 Decklist transclusions linking to Card Appearances pages 
 Is this something that needs to be fixed? -- Golden Key  ( talk  •  contribs ) 15:00, October 9, 2012 (UTC)
 
 Yes. It was remnant of when we put all anime/manga lores in separate CardTables on the card appearances pages. If you see any, remove them. I thought I had gotten them all, though.  Cheesedude  ( talk  •  contribs ) 16:35, October 9, 2012 (UTC) 
 Okay, how do I do that? -- Golden Key  ( talk  •  contribs ) 23:59, November 10, 2012 (UTC) 
 Oh hell, it must be  another  SMW issue or something. There are no links on this page that point to a Card Appearances page.  Cheesedude  ( talk  •  contribs ) 00:04, November 11, 2012 (UTC) 
 Gotta report this to WikiStaff. -- i F r e d C a t  00:06, November 11, 2012 (UTC)
