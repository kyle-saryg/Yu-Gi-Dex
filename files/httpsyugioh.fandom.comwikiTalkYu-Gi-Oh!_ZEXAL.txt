 Speculation on it's set air date 
 Toonzaki on their facebook has stated that 5D's will have a total of 154 episodes, and if that's the case...
 5D's will end on April 6, 2011 (if there are no more 1 week breaks like the New Year one coming up)
Zexal should then begin the week after on April 13, 2011.  DranzerX13  ( talk  •  contribs ) 22:49, December 13, 2010 (UTC)
 
 Regarding title name 
 I don't believe the official name for this series would be "ZEXAL", but simply "ZEAL", since that's what the katakana part at the end of the original japanese title reads.
It would also not be pronounced like the english word "ZEAL", but more like "Seh-Al".
 I think the "X" found right in the middle of the english depiction of the title is merely decorative. I agree that it's given to mislead people who don't read japanese. There is a small chance I might be wrong, but still I thought it was worth sharing this potential correction, or just pointing out this curiosity.
 Oh, and sorry... but I'd rather not leave my IP to be known to the general public. Don't ask.  —Preceding undated comment added 20:17, 18 December 2010 (UTC)

 Albeit silent, the "X" is indeed part of the name. It has been written in a normal font in  V Jump  as "ZEXAL" and the url of its official site includes the "X":  http://www.tv-tokyo.co.jp/anime/yugioh-zexal/main_index.html  --  Deltaneos  ( talk ) 20:25, December 18, 2010 (UTC)
 Just a suggestion, you could write it like this: ZE×AL, I think it's pretty clear that × (ALT+99998) is decorative. I understand the consensus was made, and quite some time ago, but I just thought I might propose an alternate option that no one has yet.  86.45.55.38  ( talk ) 23:26, April 12, 2011 (UTC) 
 Thanks for the suggestion. That's a multiplication symbol and I haven't seen anywhere else present it using that symbol. I don't think it's our place to introduce an alternate way of writing it. I don't see the problem with using a regular "X". I can see how one can think the "X" is a decoration based on the pronunciation and logo, but official sources in typeface ( example ) show that the "X" is part of the spelling. Based on this, we can conclude it's a silent letter, not much different than the "k" in "knife". --  Deltaneos  ( talk ) 23:51, April 12, 2011 (UTC) 
 yuma main monster (aparently)

 Exceed Summon 
 Why did people put it as Excess Summon on wikia?
The Katakana reads EKUSHIIZU, which surely tranlates to Exceed?

 Dueling 
 In ZEXAL it doesn't seem like there is any new form of dueling in Yu-gi-oh! they dueled in arenas and duel disks like in gx in 5ds they rode motorcycles correct me if i'm wrong but i really don't see the point do they even use motorcycles here because every yugioh series has the old way of dueling and the new way this is just weird. I would like to adda that  in kazuki takahashi's page on this wiki it says that 5ds would be the last it feels like he doesn't even like his creation and that he is tired of it. Please help me understand these two conflicts.-Av293 19:44 PM Jan. 1, 2011  —This unsigned comment was made by  Av293  ( talk  •  contribs ) 03:45, 2 January 2011 (UTC) 
 
 If you type ~~~~ at the end of your message, it should automatically create a signature with links to your user page and use the server time zone. 
 There is a new way of dueling in  ZEXAL , using  D-Gazers . 
 Saying Takahashi doesn't endorse the new series or is tired of  Yu-Gi-Oh!  because he had wanted  5D's  to be the last would be original research, so it shouldn't be mentioned on his page or this page. Anyway, the  bunkoban  afterwords suggests that he does like  5D's  and has even designed characters for it. In his blog, he has said that he has done some character design for  ZEXAL  and seems to like it. --  Deltaneos  ( talk ) 14:53, January 2, 2011 (UTC)

 New Legend 
 Do any of you guys know what the knew legend that is about to begin is. It says in the plot that a new legend will begin when Ryoga and Yuma duel. So in the original series it was about an Egyptian pharaoh, in 5ds it was the signers and the Nazca lines so what is it now? It is weird because there is an artifact that was used (so it has to be special), a gate with a weird face on it, and two duelists, and when they duel a weird entity shows up, a little familiar to anyone. That is the same thing with 5ds sort of, Yusei and Jack duel and then the crimson dragon appears sounds pretty similar to me. But anyways, does anyone get what these guys have as a plot? Av293 Av293  ( talk  •  contribs ) 22:03, January 4, 2011 (UTC)
 because the plot reminds me of the 3 series
yu-gi-oh! astral lost that memory and that key that reminds me of the Millennium Puzzle
yu-gi-oh! gx that are in school and most children look of the characters
yu-gi-oh! 5d's for special invocation and the duel between Jack and Yusei which appears crimson dragon
in this case the duel between Yuma and Ryoga in which they are astral
 pardon if I'm wrong in something I do not speak very well English
I speak Spanish but this wiki is more complete
 
 Setting Clarification 
 It says that ZEXAL takes place in "the near future," but what does that mean? Is it the future after the original series or after 5D's? I think it would be best to clarify this. -- GoldenSandslash15  (too lazy to log in)

 Any word on the anime being licensed? 
 Now that ZEXAL is starting in Japan, and 4kids is in the middle of 5D's, has there been any word of Studio Gallop or NAS (or whoever is in charge of production for that matter) deciding to license it to somebody else, or will they wait until 4kids is done with 5D's before an announcement (if any) is made?
 If 4kids gets it, hopefully it won't be as bad as "5 Duel Scoop".
 174.31.225.42  ( talk ) 20:34, March 30, 2011 (UTC)
 
 4Kids didn't call  5D's  "5 Duel Scoop". A magazine containing five articles on  Yu-Gi-Oh! 5D's  referred to the five articles as "5 Duel Scoop" and many people misinterpreted that as being what the series name stood for. Odds aren't in favour of 4Kids dubbing this series. See  Forum:TV Tokyo + NAS sues 4kids  for more information. --  Deltaneos  ( talk ) 20:42, March 30, 2011 (UTC) 
 Hmm, I wish VizMedia would take the license for it. In my opinion they're one of the best dubbers, with Funimation in second. (Because of their One Piece takeover and the 90s DBZ dub). Viz does well with Manga so perhaps they might take dubbing it before 4Kids decides to. I also wish Viz redubs 5Ds as well. TanorFaux  ( talk  •  contribs ) 18:27, June 2, 2011 (UTC) 
 4Kids is done with Yu-Gi-Oh!, the  TV Tokyo/NAS lawsuit  saw to that.  「 ダイノ ガイ 千？！ 」 ?  ·  ☎ Dinoguy1000  16:09, June 20, 2011 (UTC) 
 No. The court case is delayed sufficiently and 4Kids has the rights to YGO until the case is actually settled. Sources seem to indicate that they are planning to stop dubbing 5D's and start dubbing ZEXAL, since 5D's has been a ratings failure recently.

 Pronounciation 
 Why does it say that the correct pronunciation of  Zexal  is  zeal  when it's clearly pronounced  zael ? The "Zeal" in  Zexal  is pronounced  zeh-ahl  (or  zeh-ah-ru , technically) in Japanese, so the spelling makes sense to them. And it's the OFFICIAL spelling, so I'm not saying we need to change THAT. But despite the odd spelling, it SHOULD be pronounced  zael .
 Also, the pronunciation of Xyz would be  ex-seez , not  ik-seez . What sense does that make? 67.183.145.220  ( talk ) 23:09, July 8, 2011 (UTC)
 
 Are you pronouncing the "eh" in "zeh", like the Canadian " eh " or like the "eh" in " meh "? Assuming you meant like the Canadian one... 
 Isn't  ゼ  pronounced "ze", not "zeh"? Like how ゼロ = zero, not zehro or zaero. To me it sounds more like they're saying  zee-ahr , than  zeh-ahr   here . It's also spelled ZEXAL with a decorative X, rather than ZAXEL. --  Deltaneos  ( talk ) 13:46, July 9, 2011 (UTC) 
 I didn't mean like a Canadian "eh". I meant like "meh". ゼ (ze) rhymes with "meh". You can't really try to go by how it SOUNDS unless you are very familiar with the language, because most Americans I've spoken to seem to think they hear things that are actually VERY different from what's actually being said.
 Also, I said that it's written ZEXAL rather than ZAXEL because to the Japanese, ZEAL makes sense to be pronounced zeh-ahl. ゼアル is written ze-a-ru in alphabet characters. Those morae are pronounced zeh-ah-roo (all short sounds...Japanese short sounds are not the same as English ones, by the way). Zearu becomes Zeal if you change "ru" into an L. It makes sense to the Japanese, but not so much to English speakers. Either way, it's official, and whether it LOOKS like it should be pronounced  zael  (rhyming with kale  [1] ) or not, it IS pronounced that way. 67.183.145.220  ( talk ) 17:15, July 9, 2011 (UTC)
 
 Oh apologies, I understand what you mean now. I was mistakenly pronouncing the Japanese -e syllables like the -i ones. I think you are right about the  zeh-ahl  pronunciation now. --  Deltaneos  ( talk ) 19:17, July 9, 2011 (UTC) 
 So, am I allowed to correct the pronunciation? Also, though it's not on this page,  Xyz  is meant to be pronounced  ex-seez ; you know, like the sounds the letters make as a word. I know Konami's site says " It’s pronounced ik-seez. (You say it like a word. Don’t just spell out the letters!) ", but their pronunciation contradicts what they say afterwards. The letter X wouldn't make an  ik  sound. Sounds like some weird kind of accent if you ask me... Like saying " ik-struh " (extra) or " the letter iks "... 67.183.145.220  ( talk ) 00:32, July 10, 2011 (UTC)
 
 I've no objections to changing the pronunciation on the article. You should probably mention in your edit summary that anyone who disagrees should see the talk page if they disagree. 
 Since Konami specifically used the "ik-seez" pronunciation, it's somewhat official even if it doesn't match the spelling or the Japanese name, like the dub pronunciation of "Muto". I think it's best we note both pronunciations on the article for now. If English commercials or an anime dub show that they're using the "ek" pronunciation, we can write the "ik" one off as a mistake. --  Deltaneos  ( talk ) 01:16, July 10, 2011 (UTC) 
 Okay. Though, I'm assuming we'll hear both "ik" and "ex". It's like how in Dragon Ball Z Kai, the narrator pronounces Goku correctly (well, used to), while everyone else in the show pronounced it incorrectly. Correctly:  goh-KOO ; incorrectly:  GOH-koo . Most dubs are too lazily produced to make sure everyone's pronouncing names correctly. However, in the English dub of  Yu-Gi-Oh! Duel Monsters , they don't just  pronounce  Mutō incorrectly, they completely changed the name to  Moto . 67.183.145.220  ( talk ) 18:07, July 10, 2011 (UTC)
 
 No, they didn't. The closed captioning always said "Muto", though they pronounced it "Moto".  Cheesedude  ( talk  •  contribs ) 00:19, July 11, 2011 (UTC) 
 Hmm... You're right. I guess that card I saw must've been a fake. I just checked my DVD and they called Yugi's granpa "Sugoroku Muto", but they pronounced the Muto part as  Moto . Weird... 67.183.145.220  ( talk ) 20:57, July 11, 2011 (UTC)
 
 Sugoroku is his Japanese version name. He's called Solomon in the English anime, unless you happen to have the 4Kids uncut DVDs (or the Singaporean dub if they have DVDs), which mix English and Japanese names. --  Deltaneos  ( talk ) 19:01, July 12, 2011 (UTC)

 Ignore the "X" (which you can see is purely decorative from the ZEXAL logo and from its pronunciation), and you get  zeal . Beyond that, I really couldn't say what implication Konami is going for here.  「 ダイノ ガイ 千？！ 」 ?  ·  ☎ Dinoguy1000  21:50, August 19, 2011 (UTC)

 RE: Duel statues...you see DM and GX monsters but nothing from 5Ds, which is odd considering Yusei and his gang were kind of famous at the end of the series. They never reference 5Ds at all to the best of my knowledge (Synchros, Neo Domino, etc.) which implies that it takes place in a different setting.
 A lot of people speculate that Zexal is the "alternate" to 5Ds. Basically it takes place a while after GX in a world where Moment was never invented and all subsequent events never happened.

 I'm gonna go out on a limb and say that Zexal is a parallel sequel to 5ds, meaning it takes place at around the same time, albeit in a completely different location...most of the events in 5ds were within neo domino city, and I don't think heartland city is the same city at all

 We have to end editors adding impossibIe voice actors to the characters.

 Allusions. 
 So this has always bugged me how people find this most nitpicky of similarites and add them as "allusions" to past series, so im gonna go clean some of the nonsense up(things like two characters wearing the color red, or some other trivia that is posed based on opinion only). F8lfire  ( talk  •  contribs ) 20:00, April 13, 2014 (UTC)
 
I think the Allusions section of the page should be deleted, as most of the information is rather nitpicky, and this is the only page on the entire site that has it. F8lfire  ( talk  •  contribs ) 19:25, October 22, 2015 (UTC)
 
 Strong support. --   The Talk   Goblin  06:31, October 23, 2015 (UTC)
 Someone already made a page containing the allusions and I moved it to the forum. Feel free to put any other allusions you can think of  here .  ChaosGallade  ( talk  •  contribs ) 07:59, October 23, 2015 (UTC) 
 Alternate timeline/alternate universe? 
 "GX" is a sequel to "Duel Monsters" (anime series). It takes place within the same universe, namely it is set 10 years after the final events of "Duel Monsters". "5D's" is set further into the future after the present events of GX. So what I am trying to say is, that Yugi Muto, Jaden Yuki, as well as Yusei Fudo lived in the same plane of space (same universe) but at different points in time (timeline/history).
 My Question is: Considering that as of February 22nd of 2015, all episodes have been dubbed into English (noting that the wiki is written primarily in English after all): Is ZEXAL considered to exist in the same universe as any of the previous anime series (Duel Monsters, GX, 5D's)? Does it make reference to the events that occurred in any of them? Any of the characters of those series?
 Jdogno7  ( talk  •  contribs ) 06:35, November 2, 2015 (UTC)
 
 No, it doesn't, bar the episodes at the Duel Lodge where statues of GX and DM monsters (and Blade Armor Ninja) are shown. Does that mean that it's an alternate universe? No, it does not. In fact, the Original Dimension from ARC-V splitting into dimensions based on DM, GX, 5D's and ZEXAL implies that they are all in the same universe. This whole "ZEXAL is non-canon" garbage is only a thing because people dislike it and want to dissociate it from the other series. 
 Continuing on that, why on earth is there a timeline placement section on the main page? Does that even need to be in there? It seems too opinionated to be a thing.  Sanokal K-T  ( talk  •  contribs ) 19:17, January 21, 2017 (UTC)
 
 There is no official word on timeline placement post-5D's in any capacity, nor I think there will ever be. 
 And yes, that section should go, I see its already been taken out.  Cheesedude  ( talk  •  contribs ) 22:04, January 21, 2017 (UTC) 
 Yeah, I didn't realize that the section had only been added today, and didn't want to start another EW.  Sanokal K-T  ( talk  •  contribs ) 22:44, January 21, 2017 (UTC)
