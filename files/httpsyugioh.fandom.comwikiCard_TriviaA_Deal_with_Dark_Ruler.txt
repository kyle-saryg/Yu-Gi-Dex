 " Dark Ruler Ha Des " appears in this card's artwork, hence the card's name, despite not being part of the  Archfiend  archetype. 
 This card seems to allude to deals that  Hades  had made with two  Greek heroes  after they had completed certain, but separate tasks:
 The first one being  Orpheus  after he had traveled to the  Underworld  to find his lost love,  Eurydice  while playing  songs  that melted the hearts of two of the Underworld dwellers  Cerberus  and  Charon . After Orpheus had played a song on his  lyre  that touched the heart of the Greek god of death, Hades allowed Orpheus to travel with Eurydice back into the  human world  under the condition that he did not look back and always traveled in front of Eurydice. 
 The second one being  Heracles  defeating Cerberus in his  Twelve Labours . With Heracles, after he had defeated Cerberus, Hades allowed Heracles to bring Cerberus to Eurytheus under the condition that he did not harm the animal and return it back to the gates of the Underworld once he was done.
