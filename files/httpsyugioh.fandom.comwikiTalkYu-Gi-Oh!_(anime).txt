 Should it be noted that this is the only complete dubbed series? (not counting Capsule Monsters)  Gohan Signer  ( talk  •  contribs ) 12:55, December 31, 2011 (UTC)
 
 Capsule Monsters 
 Any reason why not to include this title into this anime?
 If it is so complicated, we can always use {{Main|}} template.  ☺  Energy X  ☻  19:07, April 9, 2020 (UTC)
 
It is generally considered to be a separate series, isn't it? I think at the very least that part about it taking place between the Grand Championship and Dawn of the Duel needs to be removed and the number in the trivia needs to be changed back to say 224 episodes and not 236.

 There's a Capsule Monsters arc in the manga too. Just told out much differently.  Pitifulheartles  ( talk  •  contribs ) 19:40, April 9, 2020 (UTC)
 Capsule Monsters also aired during GX's time rather than the one of this series. Ninja72  ( talk  •  contribs ) 19:56, April 9, 2020 (UTC)
 
 What about official sources? What do they say about this?  ☺  Energy X  ☻  20:33, April 9, 2020 (UTC)
 Wikipedia says it's part of season 5.  Pitifulheartles  ( talk  •  contribs ) 20:52, April 9, 2020 (UTC)
 Yet they have a cite template next to that statement, meaning they currently do not have a source for it. Ninja72  ( talk  •  contribs ) 20:59, April 9, 2020 (UTC) 
 https://www.amazon.com/Yu-Gi-Oh-Movie-Capsule-Monsters-Part/dp/B000ENUKS0  goes as far as to call it a feature film.  Pitifulheartles  ( talk  •  contribs ) 20:54, April 9, 2020 (UTC) 
 The OFFICIAL YUGIOH WEBSITE:  https://www.yugioh.com/episodes?season=5&show_id=1  Has Capsule Monsters as episode 5.15.  Pitifulheartles  ( talk  •  contribs ) 21:14, April 9, 2020 (UTC)
 
 Fair enough.  ☺  Energy X  ☻  09:18, April 13, 2020 (UTC) 
 Logo not showing 
 The logo isn't showing on the page. Could someone fix it? Morty340 18:25, October 19, 2020 (UTC)
 
 There's nothing to fix. The image is there. Seems the fandom is having caching issues lately.  Pitifulheartles  ( talk  •  contribs ) 18:26, October 19, 2020 (UTC)
