         Vetrix 's energy ball.     
 An  energy ball  is an ability used offensively in the  Yu-Gi-Oh! ZEXAL  anime. The user creates a medium-sized to large-sized energy sphere with a color determined by the wielder. It was first used in the series by  Fortuno  during his number hunt. [1]   Hart Tenjo  was able to create an energy ball around him and make it grow larger. [2] [3]   Vetrix  was later capable of doing so with the power he stole from Hart. [4]  Later in the series, the  Barian   Emperor   Mizar  produced energy balls to use as weapons, though they did not cause permanent harm. [5]  He also generated a red energy ball upon arriving on  Earth  from the  Barian World , a variation that was later used by  Vector . [5] [6]  After  Ranking Up  with Barian power,  Number 96  opened portals and launch extremely powerful energy balls much like the Barians, as seen when he attacked the  Astral World  and the  Barian World . [7]
