 The  Battle Step  (Japanese: バトルステップ  Batoru Suteppu ) is one of the four steps of the  Battle Phase . In particular, it is the step in which  attacks  are  declared . Immediately after the  Start Step  or  Damage Step  ends, the game proceeds to the Battle Step, regardless of the  turn player 's intention to  declare  an  attack .

 Breakdown of the Battle Step 
 The turn player is not required to declare an attack during the Battle Step, [1]  unless a card effect specifies otherwise, such as those of " Berserk Gorilla " and " Evil HERO Malicious Fiend ". If the  attack target   leaves the field  or a monster is placed on the opponent's field (from the perspective of the turn player) at any point during the Battle Step while an attack is occurring, a  replay  occurs. Once an attack has been declared, the Battle Step does not end until an open  game state  is reached and both players have agreed to move on from the Battle Step (as per the rules of  fast effect timing ).
 
 Attack Declaration Window 
 Japanese:  攻 撃 宣 言 時  ( Kōgeki Sengenji )
 During the Battle Step, the turn player can declare an attack by choosing 1 face-up  Attack Position  monster they control (or  Defense Position Attacker ) to attack with, and a valid  attack target : their opponent or a monster their opponent controls. If the opponent controls monsters, the turn player cannot declare a direct attack unless a  card effect  allows them to do so, such as that of " Wattkey " or " The Legendary Fisherman ". [1] 
 Upon an attack being declared, players can activate cards or effects in  response  to the attack, as per the rules of  fast effect timing . As such, there can only be one  Chain  made in response to the attack. All cards and effects in this one Chain are in response to both the attack and the preceding  Chain Link , so cards such as " Mirror Force " and " Dimensional Prison " can be activated at separate  Chain Links  in this Chain. [2] 
 
 Before Damage Step 
 After the Attack Declaration Window, or if neither player activated a card or effect in response to the attack, there are still opportunities to activate cards and effects during this Battle Step (as per the rules of  fast effect timing ). However, it is no longer possible to activate cards or effects in response to the attack, so cards such as "Mirror Force" and "Dimensional Prison" can no longer be activated in response to this attack. [3] [4] [5] 
 Once both players have agreed to move on, if an attack is still occurring, the  Damage Step  is entered. If there is no attack occurring, the  End Step  is entered instead.

But then you can Chain Mirror Force or a second Dimensional Prison to the Rabbit's effect."
