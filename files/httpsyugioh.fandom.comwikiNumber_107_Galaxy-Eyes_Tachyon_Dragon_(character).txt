 Biography 
 History 
 Like the other  Over-Hundred Numbers , Tachyon was "created" by  Don Thousand  to corrupt the  Seven Barian Emperors ' true human forms. Specifically, Tachyon's purpose was to corrupt Mizar's memories of his life as a human as part of Don Thousand's plan to restore his powers. In the English Dub, Tachyon is also the source of Don Thousand's power that falsified Mizar's memories into believing that he betrayed Jinlong. [1] 
 Unlike the other Over-Hundred Numbers, Tachyon, along with  Number 62: Galaxy-Eyes Prime Photon Dragon  and  Number 46: Dragluon , was one of the  Numbers  needed to resurrect the  Numeron Dragon  as described in the  Legend of the Dragons of Light and Time . In the legend, Tachyon is described as the Dragon of Time. It was confirmed that Tachyon is actually created by the  Numeron Code  before it inhabits in the Barian World before Don Thousand transformed the monster into its  corrupted form . [2] 
 
 Meeting Mizar 
       Mizar sealing Tachyon in a blank card     
 In an unknown realm,  Mizar  confronted Tachyon as it emerged from a cave. Mizar pulled out a blank card and started absorbing Tachyon into it. He was pushed back as Tachyon roared and chunks of rock flew about, but he was eventually successful, Tachyon became streams of pink energy which surged into the card. He commented that this exhausted him as usual. (in the dub, Mizar thought that he would be unstoppable with this card in his Deck). [3] 
 
 The 3 become 1 
 After  Kite  defeated Mizar in the sacred crater of the Moon where a purified Tachyon, " Prime Photon " and  Dragluon  were involved, the spirits of the three Dragons combined into a golden serpentine dragon as the Number 100 flashed out. After witnessing the rebirth of this godlike dragon, Mizar and Kite both realized that " Number 100: Numeron Dragon " was the true form of their respective "Galaxy-Eyes" monsters. [4]
