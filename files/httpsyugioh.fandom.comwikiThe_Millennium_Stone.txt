 History 
 Creation 
 While the Millennium Items were being created by  Aknadin  by sacrificing 99 humans from  Kul Elna , he put the blood, bone, and flesh in the Millennium Stone in order to forge them, with all slots for each of the Millennium Items the exact same shape and size as them.
 
 Millennium World 
 In the manga, during  Pharaoh Akhenamkhanen's  reign, the Pharaoh sacrificed part of his spirit to seal a soul within the Stone. That spirit was  Hasan , guardian of the Pharaoh.
 The Stone was in Kul Elna in the  Shrine of the Millennium Stone , and was used by  Bakura  to put the Items in the Stone in order to summon  Zorc Necrophades . When he stole the  Millennium Pendant  and the  Ring , he inserted them in the Stone. Later, during  Atem 's, the Priests', and Bakura's fight,  Mahado  attempted to destroy by making a pillar fall on it, so that " Diabound " can expose itself by protecting it. However, it failed when Bakura Summoned " Skeleton Fiend " to protect it.
 In the anime only, Bakura seemed to have merged with the tablet, then Zorc emerged, thus destroying the Stone in the process.  
 
 Ceremonial Battle 
 In the present, when  Marik ,  Ishizu ,  Yugi  and co. went to the shrine for performing the Ceremonial Battle,  Yami  inserted the Items into the Stone. Later, after the Battle, the palace started to fall apart, and the Millennium Stone shattered.
 
 The Dark Side of Dimensions 
 The remnants of the Stone are excavated along with fragments of the Millennium Puzzle.
