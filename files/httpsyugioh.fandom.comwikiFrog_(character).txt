 Biography 
 Hanoi 
 Frog logged into  LINK VRAINS  to search for Playmaker in order to get a scoop. He rendezvoused with Pigeon on a rooftop, when the latter called him by his real name, much to his annoyance. He then noted the large number of reporters present to cover Playmaker, instead of the duelists that usually gathered in the area. When "Playmaker" appeared, Frog wanted to begin the scoop, but Pigeon noted the presence of other Playmaker avatars nearby, and concluded that all of them had to be impersonators, much to Frog's dismay. [1] 
 Frog and Pigeon later filmed  Blue Angel  issuing a public duel challenge to Playmaker. Before leaving to fulfill other commitments, Frog told Blue Angel to notify them if Playmaker accepted her challenge. [2]  Frog and Pigeon later attempted to scoop on a potential rematch when Blue Angel reappeared not long after her defeat, but were then surprised to hear Playmaker remark that Blue Angel was not real. [3] 
 A few days after  Varis ' assault on LINK VRAINS, Frog and Pigeon contacted " Ghost Girl " for an interview regarding recent events in LINK VRAINS. Due to Ghost Girl's expensive prices, Frog spent all of his and Pigeon's budgets and extra bonuses. She gave them a data file with the answers to the questions they sent her as well as everything she discovered involving Playmaker and what she witnessed during Varis' attack. Frog and Pigeon went to a private editing room to check Ghost Girl's data and prepare a big scoop, but before they could publish the article Yusaku and  Kolter  deleted it while cleaning "Playmaker" files across the network much to Frog and Pigeon's dismay. [4] 
 Frog and Pigeon stumbled into "Ghost Girl" about to start a Duel against "Playmaker" which they recorded. During the Duel, they argued about what is more important, their report or Playmaker's title as "Hero of LINK VRAINS". When the Duel concluded, "Ghost Girl" deleted Pigeon's recording, leaving him and Frog without anything to make their Playmaker scoop yet again. [5] 
 
 The Deleted 
 Frog and Pigeon wandered around LINK VRAINS during the peak of  The Deleted . They found that everyone else but the Knights of Hanoi remained. Frog repeated his mission of getting a scoop no matter how dangerous it is. Just then,  Baira  logged in and threatened to delete Frog and Pigeon, but they were saved when Blue Angel showed up to challenge Baira.  [6] 
 Frog and Pigeon later witnessed the Tower of Hanoi emerge, destroying virtual buildings and absorbing avatars in its wake.  [7]  In the aftermath, Frog and Pigeon remained the only journalists still inside LINK VRAINS. They witnessed  Specter  defeat  Kitamura , the latter being disintegrated into data. Specter then saw Frog and Pigeon and announced that LINK VRAINS was out of bounds. This caused Frog and Pigeon to flee before being blown away by sand. Frog and Pigeon later witnessed Playmaker form an alliance with  The Gore  and Blue Angel, only for Pigeon to tell Frog that he didn't turn the camera on.  [8] 
 Frog and Pigeon looked for Playmaker in LINK VRAINS. Pigeon was hit by a rock and dropped Frog. They noticed that a youngster whose avatar resembled Playmaker was responsible. Pigeon then carried Frog over a dust storm to evade it, but the dust storm went for the defenseless youngster. He was saved by the real Playmaker, who urged the youngster to log out. Only then did Frog find out that Pigeon forgot to film it again. Frog and Pigeon continued to navigate, until they spotted Blue Angel dueling against Specter, and put it on live feed.  [9]  They witnessed Blue Angel's brutal defeat to Specter.  [10] 
 Frog and Pigeon originally agreed to tend to Blue Angel, but upon hearing  Akira Zaizen 's voice, decided to leave. Frog and Pigeon later received an anonymous email (revealed to be from  Kolter ) pointing them to a bridge.  [11]  They went to the bridge to see Playmaker's duel against Specter. [12]  Playmaker won, but the bridge began to collapse, to Frog and Pigeon's shock.  [13] 
 Frog and Pigeon witnessed a stray  Data Storm  save Playmaker, who continued towards the tower. They then spotted The Gore facing off against  Varis , and informed Playmaker. Playmaker hurried towards where the duel was taking place, prompting Frog and Pigeon to follow.  [14]  They are blasted away by one of the attacks while filming the duel.  [15]  Frog and Pigeon then filmed Playmaker's duel against Varis on a higher ring of one of the towers.  [16]  They noticed the duel suddenly freeze,  [17]  before watching the duel till the end. They then witnessed Playmaker and Varis log back in for a rematch,  [18]  which they also filmed until the end.  [19] 
 
 Lost Memories 
 Frog and Pigeon returned to the new LINK VRAINS to report. They narrowly dodged a girl riding on a data stream. They then witnessed the return of Playmaker,  [20]  and watched his duel against a  glowing figure .  [21]  They then watched  Soulburner 's duel against  Bit Boot .  [22] .
