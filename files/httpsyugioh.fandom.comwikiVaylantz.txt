 Playing Style 
 The strategy takes advantage of the latest update to pendulums in master rule 4 where they are placed in the leftmost and rightmost spell card zones instead of the pendulum zones.
 They are a column based archetype, moving each of their monsters not just from monster zone to monster zone but from the spell and trap zones to the main monsters and getting effects from this action.
 A portion of them gain effects on your opponent's monster's on certain columns as well.
