 Desert Protector : You can destroy 1 “ Desert Protector ” to save multiple  Insects  that would be destroyed at the same time, such as with “ Nobleman-Eater Bug ”. 
 OCG Rulings 
 This effect  targets  two monsters on the field. [1] 
 If there are not two valid targets on the field, the effect is not applied. [1] 
 " Remote Revenge " cannot be used against " Nobleman-Eater Bug " or any other effect which targets multiple monsters. [2] 
 Previously Official Rulings 
   These TCG rulings were issued by  Upper Deck Entertainment  and have since been deemed unofficial by Konami. [3]  They were previously considered official and can still be correct, as long as they follow the official gameplay rules, or unless Konami has issued a ruling that says otherwise. References:  [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] 
 
 If you  activate  the effect of " Nobleman-Eater Bug " and select 2  monsters , then " Ring of Destruction " is  chained  and  destroys  1 of the selected  monsters , you still  destroy  the remaining  monster  when " Nobleman-Eater Bug 's" effect  resolves . 
 If " Nobleman-Eater Bug " is the only  monster  on the  field  and it is  flipped   face-up , then it  destroys  itself with its effect.
