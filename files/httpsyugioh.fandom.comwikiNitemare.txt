 Nitemare , known as  Card Majin  (カード魔神  Kādo Majin , Card Demon God) in the Japanese version, is the main antagonist in a few of the  Yu-Gi-Oh!  video games. He has a less powerful form,  DarkNite , which he usually appears as at first. In the Japanese versions, DarkNite is referred to as "Card Majin", while Nitemare is referred to as "Card Majin (true form)". A majin is a malevolent deity that causes misfortune and disaster.
 He appears in  Yu-Gi-Oh! Dark Duel Stories ,  Yu-Gi-Oh! Forbidden Memories  and  Yu-Gi-Oh! The Falsebound Kingdom .  Manawyddan fab Llyr  is the  Yu-Gi-Oh! The Duelists of the Roses  incarnation of Nitemare and claims to be his brother.
 Kazuki Takahashi  included line art for Nitemare, along with other rough sketches for cards for the real life card and video games in  Yu-Gi-Oh! Duelist   volume 11 .

 Appearances 
 Dark Duel Stories 
       DarkNite, in  Dark Duel Stories     
 In  Yu-Gi-Oh! Dark Duel Stories , DarkNite is the only stage 4 opponent. He is unlocked by defeating all stage 3 opponents, at least five times each.
 
 
Nitemare is a stage 5 opponent, unlocked using the password "43504084".       Nitemare, in  Dark Duel Stories     
 Forbidden Memories 
       DarkNite, in  Forbidden Memories     
 In  Yu-Gi-Oh! Forbidden Memories , Nitemare is known to be the creator of the  Shadow Games . He is sealed away in the Forbidden Ruins, only to be awoken when the 7  Millennium Items  are brought there. 
 
         Nitemare, in  Forbidden Memories     
 When  Heishin  awakens DarkNite, he attempts to order him claiming it is part of the pact, but Darknite says that he does not recall making a pact with Heishin. When Heishin begins to plea with DarkNite, he quickly grows tired of the conversation and turns Heishin into a  card . Finding it to be the noisiest and ugliest he ever created, DarkNite burns it saying it doesn't deserve a place in his Deck.
 DarkNite then turns to  the prince  and  Seto  saying that they would make nice additions to his Deck. Seto reminds the prince about the  Millennium Item Cards . The prince then holds out the cards forcing DarkNite back. Unable to fully hold him back, the prince is left to duel DarkNite. After losing once DarkNite refuses to accept his defeat and turns into Nitemare demanding another Duel. The prince proceeds to defeat Nitemare, sending him back to where he came from to return in The Falsebound Kingdom. If the player loses to Nitemare, he'll rub in his victory and celebrate owning Earth all to himself.
 
 
 The Falsebound Kingdom 
         DarkNite in  The Falsebound Kingdom     
 In  Yu-Gi-Oh! The Falsebound Kingdom , DarkNite is the final boss. He is described as a "dark spirit," who is turned loose by  Scott Irvine  after the hero (either  Yami Yugi  or  Seto Kaiba ) dismantles Irvine's virtual world, The Kingdom.
 
         Nitemare in  The Falsebound Kingdom     
 Though DarkNite has only one monster, it's one of the powerful  Egyptian God Cards . Which god card is faced depends on the hero and seems to correspond to the God each hero has the most rivalry with; Yugi faces " Obelisk the Tormentor "and Seto faces " Slifer the Sky Dragon ." Post defeating him, The Kingdom is shut down once and for all.
 DarkNite doesn't appear in Joey's storyline since it is a prequel to the former two storylines where he faces Marik who uses the " The Winged Dragon of Ra " as his final opponent.
 On a replay game, it is possible to face him as Nitemare, whose God card will have maxed-out stats nor can be weakened.
 
 
 Deck 
 Darknite and Nitemare use a Labyrinth themed Deck. Nitemare uses  Gate Guardian  and the monsters who composite him:  Kazejin ,  Suijin  and  Sanga of the Thunder , as well as spells such as  Raigeki  or  Change of Heart .
