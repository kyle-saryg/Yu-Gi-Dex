 Event Details 
 The D.D. Castle: Emergence has 30 floors. 
 Duels are taken in Wave Duels, where it's you against 3 other enemies. Once the enemy reaches 0 LP, the next wave is started on their turn, regardless if it was your turn or not. 
 The player must defeat all monsters on a floor to move on to the next floor. Also, they will receive a reward each time they complete a floor. 
 There will be Duel Missions that the player can complete each day to earn Castle Keys (which only consist of playing Ranked Duels). There will also be a gift containing 10 Castle Keys each day as well as a daily 15 Castle Keys upon entering the D.D. Castle: Emergence page. 
 The player's LP carry over between waves, and so does the dueling status. 
 The enemy summons the card they're based after from outside the Duel at the start of the wave (Ex.  Skilled Dark Magician  summons  Skilled Dark Magician , etc.). If there are already monsters on the field when the wave starts, the enemy will send 1 monster to the Graveyard to summon the aforementioned monster. 
 There is an event exclusive item called EX Draw & Summon, letting you be able to draw 2 cards instead of 1 during your Draw Phase and allowing you to Normal Summon twice during your Main Phase. 
 There will also be occasional Castle Guards (those being  Turu-Purun ,  Star Boy ,  Karate Man ,  Imairuka ,  The Six Samurai - Yariza ,  Thunder Kid ,  The Six Samurai - Nisashi ,  Stray Asmodian , and  Doom Dozer ), these Duels do not require Castle Keys to duel and give out more Lottery Coins than usual, but you must wait until they appear again after you duel them. 
 There are also Castle Scouts that appear on the main map, such as  Beiige, Vanguard of Dark World  and  Scarr, Scout of Dark World . These are similar to Legendary Duelists, but use the wave format of the Castle. 
 If you deal battle damage with a monster that has an attribute that the enemy is weak to, then it deals 3 times the damage instead. 
 Axel Brodie  and  Tour Guide From the Underworld  appear as exhibition NPCs. Completing the 22nd floor unlocks Axel as a playable character.
