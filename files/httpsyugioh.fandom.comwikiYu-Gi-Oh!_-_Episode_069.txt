 Featured Duel: Joey Wheeler vs. Mako Tsunami, Part 2 
 Duel continued from previous episode. 
 Joey  has 3200  Life Points  remaining and controls " Alligator's Sword " (1500/1200) in Attack Position.
 Mako  has 3300 Life Points remaining and controls " Umi ".
 Turn 9: Joey 
 Joey  draws " Polymerization ". He then  Normal Summons  " Baby Dragon " (1200/700) in  Attack Position . Next he  activates  "Polymerization", fusing "Baby Dragon" and " Alligator's Sword " in order to  Fusion Summon  " Alligator's Sword Dragon " (1700/1600) in  Attack Position . Due to the rules of Battle City, Fusion Monsters are forbidden from attacking the turn they are Fusion Summoned.
 Turn 10: Mako 
 Mako  draws. He then  Sets  a  monster .
 Turn 11: Joey 
Joey draws. Since the only monster Mako controls is a set monster, "Alligator's Sword Dragon"  attacks   directly  via its own effect ( Mako Tsunami  3300 → 1600). 
 Turn 12: Mako 
 Mako  draws. He then  Sets  a card.
 Turn 13: Joey 
Joey draws. He then sets a card. "Alligator's Sword Dragon" attacks directly, but Mako  activates  his face-down " Tornado Wall ". Now while " Umi " is face-up, Mako will take no Battle Damage from any of Joey's attacking monsters. The attack continues, but Mako takes no damage.
 Turn 14: Mako 
 Mako   Tributes  his  Set   monster  in order to  Tribute Summon  " The Legendary Fisherman " (1850/1600) in  Attack Position . "The Legendary Fisherman" attacks "Alligator's Sword Dragon", but  Joey   activates  his face-down " Energy Drain " to  draw  a card and reduce the ATK of "The Legendary Fisherman" to 0. However, "The Legendary Fisherman" is unaffected by the  effects  of  Magic Cards  while " Umi " is on the  field , so "Energy Drain" doesn't work on it. "The Legendary Fisherman" then  destroys  "Alligator's Sword Dragon". ( Joey  3200 → 3050).
 Turn 15: Joey 
 Joey Wheeler  draws. He then  Sets  a  monster .
 Turn 16: Mako 
Mako draws. "The Legendary Fisherman"  attacks  and  destroys   Joey's   Set   monster . It's revealed to be " Tiny Guardian " (1400/1800).
 Turn 17: Joey 
 Joey Wheeler  draws. He then  Sets  a card and  Sets  a  monster .
 Turn 18: Mako 
Mako  activates  " Fortress Whale's Oath " to Tribute " Jellyfish " and " Great White " from his hand and  Ritual Summon  " Fortress Whale " (2350 → 2550/2150 → 2350) in Attack Position. "The Legendary Fisherman"  attacks  and  destroys   Joey 's  Set   monster . It's revealed to be " Rocket Warrior " (1500/1300). "Fortress Whale" attacks directly ( Joey  3050 → 500).
 Turn 19: Joey 
 Joey  draws "Lightning Blade". His hand contains " Scapegoat ", " Kunai with Chain ", " Panther Warrior ", and "Lightning Blade". Joey  Sets  two cards and  Normal Summons  "Panther Warrior" (2000/1600) in  Attack Position .
 Turn 20: Mako 
Mako draws. "Fortress Whale"  attacks  "Panther Warrior", but  Joey   activates  his face-down " Magic Arm Shield " to redirect the attack to "The Legendary Fisherman". "Fortress Whale"  destroys  "The Legendary Fisherman" ( Mako  1600 → 900).
 Turn 21: Joey 
Joey passes.
 Turn 22: Mako 
Mako draws. "Fortress Whale" attacks "Panther Warrior", but Joey  activates  his face-down "Kunai with Chain" to equip the latter to "Panther Warrior" and increase the ATK of "Panther Warrior" by 500 ("Panther Warrior": 2000 → 2500/1600). Joey then activates his face-down " Lightning Blade " to equip the latter to "Panther Warrior" and increase the ATK of "Panther Warrior" by 800 ("Panther Warrior": 2500 → 3300/1600). "Panther Warrior"  destroys  "Fortress Whale" (Mako 900 → 150). Mako then activates " Return of the Doomed " to discard one card and  Special Summon  "The Legendary Fisherman" (1850/1600) from his Graveyard in  Attack Position .
 Turn 23: Joey 
 Joey  draws " Giant Trunade " and subsequently activates it to return all  Magic / Trap Cards  from the  field  to their respective owners'  hands  ("Panther Warrior": 3300 → 2000/1600). Joey then activates "Scapegoat" to  Special Summon  four " Sheep Tokens " (0/0 for all four) in  Defense Position . Joey then  Tributes  one "Sheep Token" to allow "Panther Warrior" to attack. "Panther Warrior" attacks and destroys "The Legendary Fisherman" ( Mako  150 → 0).
 Epilogue 
 Joey  obtains " The Legendary Fisherman " and " Fortress Whale " from  Mako  as well as two Locator Cards as per the Battle City Rules.
 
 Changes to the dub 
 The sign reading  Domino City Aquarium  is replaced by a sign with some fish on it. 
 Cut from  Mako 's flashback, his father harpooning a marlin. 
 " Energy Drain " has been redesigned in the dub. 
 " The Legendary Fisherman " harpooning  Joey's   monsters  is obscured in the dub. 
 In the dub version, when the storm hit Mako's boat,  Mako's father  and the life boat were gone. In the Japanese version it was just Mako's father. 
 A tiny bit of the memorial is cut from the US version. 
 In the Japanese version, Joey thinks of a red ocean, then  Yami Yugi  appears. The scene is replaced in the dub with previous images of the  Duel  showing " Tornado Wall " raising waterspouts. 
 Cut from the dub are scenes of the  Rare Hunters  watching the Duel.
