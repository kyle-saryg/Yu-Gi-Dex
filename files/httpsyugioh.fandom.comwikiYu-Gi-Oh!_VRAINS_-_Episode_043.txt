 Featured Duel: Playmaker vs. Varis 
         
 This Duel is conducted as a  Master Duel .
 Turn 1: Varis 
Varis activates " Boot Sector Launch ", increasing the ATK and DEF of " Rokket " monsters by 300 and activates its effect, choosing to  Special Summon  up to 2 "Rokket" Monsters from his  hand  in  Defense Position . He summons " Metalrokket Dragon " (1700 → 2000/1400 → 1700) and " Shelrokket Dragon " (1100 → 1400/2000 → 2300). He then Normal Summons " Sniffer Dragon " (800/400) and activates its effect as it was Normal or Special Summoned to add another copy of itself to his hand. Varis uses his three monsters to  Link Summon  " Vorticular Drumgon " (1000/LINK-3/←↓→), and activates its effect as it was Special Summoned to  draw  a card. He activates " Link Coin " by sending a  Link Monster  he controls to the GY. Varis excavates cards from the top of his deck, equal to the sent monster's  Link Rating , puts a card from among them into his hand and the rest back in any order on top of his deck, and he can Special Summon the monster he sent back in his next turn. He sends "Vorticular Drumgon", excavates 3 cards, and adds " Mirror Force " to his hand. Varis sets a card
 Turn 2: Playmaker 
As Playmaker controls no monsters, he Special Summons " Linkslayer " (2000/600) by its own effect. He activates the effect of "Linkslayer" to discard up to 2 cards in order to destroy that many Spell or Trap cards on the field, once per turn. He discards " Latency " and destroys Varis' set card. As Varis' " Mirror Force Launcher " was destroyed while set, Varis can set it back from his GY as well as 1 " Mirror Force " from his deck, hand or GY, also, they can be activated this turn. Playmaker Normal Summons " ROM Cloudia " (1800/0) and activates its effect as it was Normal Summoned, he can target 1 Cyberse Monster in his GY and add it to his hand. He adds "Latency" and activates its effect as it was added from his GY to his hand to Special Summon it (0/0).
 Playmaker uses "Latency" and "ROM Cloudia" to Link Summon " Restoration Point Guard " (1000/LINK-2/←↙). As "Latency" was used for a Link Summon when it was summoned by its own effect, Playmaker draws a card. He then uses "Pointguard" and "Linkslayer" to Link Summon " Excode Talker " to the Right  Extra Monster Zone  (2300/LINK-3/←↑→). As "Excode" was Link Summoned, Playmaker can choose unused Main Monster Zones, up to the number of Monster in the Extra Monster Zone, and render them unusable. He chooses Varis' Main Monster Zone in the 2nd column, counting from Playmaker's left.
 "Excode Talker" attacks directly, but Varis activates "Mirror Force" as his opponent declared an attack to destroy all of Playmaker's Attack Position monsters. As a Link Monster that used "Pointguard" as Link Material was destroyed by an effect while it's in the GY, Playmaker Special Summons it in Attack Position. "Pointguard" attacks directly (Varis: 4000 → 3000).
 Duel continues in the next episode .
