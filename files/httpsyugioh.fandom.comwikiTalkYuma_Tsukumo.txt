 Character Picture 
 I went ahead and added a full-body image.-- 火星  Wages War  00:48, December 19, 2010 (UTC)
 
 I think we should stick with a landscape image. With the fullbody one, the information in the infobox is down lower than the rest of the article. --  Deltaneos  ( talk ) 12:01, December 19, 2010 (UTC) 
 I think the image should at least be the aspect ratio corrected image, while the formatting of the page is something to be concerned about I don't think images should be incorrectly portrayed for the sake of better looks on a page, on the real Wikipedia (which i think we should take most examples from in order to create a as correct and exact wiki as possible) they would never prioritize the looks of a page over the correct aspect ratio and true representation of what the article is portraying. What if wikipedia suddenly made the iconic olympic games icon flat?  Larz9220   —Preceding undated comment added 00:48, 1 January 2011 (UTC) 
 
 My understanding has always been that infobox images should provide a clear view of the subject's face. Full-body images  can  do this, but there are times when a smaller image would do a better job.  Cheesedude  ( talk  •  contribs ) 01:41, January 1, 2011 (UTC) 
 I'm not talking about the fullbody image, I'm talking about a version of the current image (white background) where the aspect ratio isn't obscured, however it seems someone has deleted the picture in an angry response to being corrected.  —This unsigned comment was made by  Larz9220  ( talk  •  contribs ) 02:21, 1 January 2011 (UTC) 
 I have uploaded a mirror example here.  http://img707.imageshack.us/i/yumatsukumo.jpg/  This version of the picture has the aspect ratio corrected and show a more exact and intended representation of the character in question.  Larz9220   —Preceding undated comment added 02:25, 1 January 2011 (UTC) 
 PoirotH  deleted  that image five minutes after you replaced it with the full body one. That was long before you posted the comment here, so it couldn't have been in response to that. That image wasn't available when I removed the full body one. Hence why the one before it was reverted to. --  Deltaneos  ( talk ) 02:35, January 1, 2011 (UTC) 
 I understand now then, sorry for the confusion.
Back to the image, I have located a very high quality version of the pic which has correct aspect ratio and the same dimensions as the previously used so that it doesn't tamper with the structure of the page as a whole, I have uploaded it to the page, is this image more to your liking?  Larz9220 
I have improved the image in Adobe Photoshop CS3, adjusted it with some color correction and resized it to fit better. The current image now has correct aspect ratio, and is a landscape image so that the info box is not lowered on the page. This version should make all peers satisfied hopefully. Also could someone delete the previous older versions I uploaded? It appears that feature is out of my reach.  Larz9220 
 
 Preview

 New archetype ? 
 I don't know if it's the right place to ask this but anyway... Do you guys think that a article about the "Sound Effects" monsters which are played by Yuma would be needed ? They are at least five now, so...  HPZ - O.N.E.  ( talk  •  contribs ) 00:50, April 15, 2011 (UTC)
 In Yuma's deck section, should add that some of his monsters only fit in the "Syllable" category in their japanese names like Full Elf, Fairy Joe, ect. Also, the Syllables can't be considered an actual archetype because they have no support, neither do their names have any common word that relates them with each other.  —This unsigned comment was made by  201.192.44.110  ( talk  •  contribs ) 14:27, July 13, 2011 
 
 Revise 
 Episode 6 synopsis clearly states Yuma uses Revise. Also, my guess is that it will be like the most recent Kamen Rider series, Kamen Rider OOO. In OOO, the mythical being (Ankh) keeps the Core Medals and give them to Eiji (the main character) for him to use whenever needed. The same can be applied here, with Astral keeping Revise and allows Yuma to use it whenever needed. 118.96.11.119  ( talk ) 07:41, April 19, 2011 (UTC)
 
 That episode has not been aired yet, so that monster does not belong to Yuma's Deck. Anyway, how do we know Yuma becomes the owner of a certian Number monster when it is absorbed/ taken by Astral? -- 93.86.20.101  ( talk ) 17:27, April 20, 2011 (UTC)

 The Warrior Returning Alive 
 I still can't seem to find this card anywhere in episode 1. I'm assuming it must have been in the beginning when he gathers up his cards, or when he drops them due to the cleanbot. Can anyone point it out to me? If no one can, it should probably be removed.  Cheesedude  ( talk  •  contribs ) 09:37, May 17, 2011 (UTC)

 Yuma's fate 
 How do you think this series will end up? Will Yuma's Dueling skills improve to the point that he no longer needs Astral's help?  RedDrgn  ( talk  •  contribs ) 02:30, July 4, 2011 (UTC)
 
    I'm not sure, but I'd guess, once all 99 of Astral's memories are gathered, Astral will return to his world, even though Yuma (by that time) will be sad watching him leave. But I'm also wondering if the final "boss" (Dr. Faker?) could be something like the Numbers 100, one that remained so hidden from Astral, even he did not realise its disappearance.
 
 F.E.A.R.  ( talk  •  contribs ) 09:46, July 4, 2011 (UTC)F.E.A.R.
 I think that when Astral recover his memory he will become evil.There is something strange with him, he forgot evrything so is possible that he is evil and he have something with the evil door from the first episode.

 Two Gagaga Magicians? 
When I heard that  The Warrior Returning Alive  was in episode 1, I went to search, but instead, I found out that Yuma have two Gagaga Magicians. The two Gagaga Magicians can be spot when  Tetsuo Takeda  kick the Heartland cleaning robot and Yuma's deck can be seen flying. Here is the evidence:       evidence       Also, I can't found The Warrior Returning Alive in episode 1.  WinterNightmare  ( talk  •  contribs ) 05:58, July 4, 2011 (UTC)
 Hm, interesting. Go ahead and add it to the Decklist with a note then. I think I'll use that picture for the episode 1 article as well.  Cheesedude  ( talk  •  contribs ) 06:44, July 5, 2011 (UTC)

 When you think about it, guys, it's probably just placeholders when Yuma's Deck was flung into the air. The same thing has happened plenty of times in past YGO! series. 
 BigBDawg 
 
 Sure, but we have no proof of that, so it should still be listed. And a lot of the past placeholders have been random dub changes as well.  Cheesedude  ( talk  •  contribs ) 14:11, July 24, 2011 (UTC) 
 Biography is a bit old 
 The anime biography is a bit old, just reaching to his duel with Tokunosuke, it should be updated.  —This unsigned comment was made by  201.192.44.110  ( talk  •  contribs ) 01:53, July 15, 2011 
 
 Yes, but we need to wait for complete knowledge of those later episodes, as well as SUB. Otherwise, we are just spamming the fake information and waste of their times just to reverse it back to normal. -- F r e d C a t  10:20, July 15, 2011 (UTC)

 Is there really necessary to put every detail about what happens in each episode?, because if they keep like this the article wil be about 10 or 15 miles long by the time Zexal ends.  —This unsigned comment was made by  192.44.110  ( talk  •  contribs ) 14:32, July 30, 2011 201 
 Decks 
 Should we list a separated decklist for his Statue Duel against  Rokujuro ? -- Aged Goblin  ( talk  •  contribs ) 19:41, July 18, 2011 (UTC)
 
 Absolutely. More or less to comparable to when Yusei used a separate Deck the Facility.  Cheesedude  ( talk  •  contribs ) 23:17, July 18, 2011 (UTC) 
 Why are cards seen on the pillar removed? It seems that the pillar functions as the opening hand. The R-guy had also his own pillar with a Deck. He also wouldn't able to OTK Yuma if he only used a card which he was supposed to draw during his turn. BTW, does anybody know what Deck the R-guy gave to Yuma and which card was seen on its bottom? -- Aged Goblin  ( talk  •  contribs ) 23:37, July 25, 2011 (UTC)
 
 Isn't Rokujuro shown with an actual hand of cards, though? I'm wrong about that, feel free to revert it.  Cheesedude  ( talk  •  contribs ) 23:49, July 25, 2011 (UTC) 
 Indeed, he didn't have any cards in hand prior to his turn like Yuma. -- Aged Goblin  ( talk  •  contribs ) 00:22, July 26, 2011 (UTC) 
 Can we have a separate deck starting from episode 17? yuma received a new deck in 16, and he (or tetsuo) mentioned he can strengthen his deck with this. is it possible that he mixed some cards from the new deck into the old deck? so maybe we can separate or wait till episode 17 to air then decide? - Lpoi  ( talk  •  contribs ) 05:35, July 29, 2011 (UTC)
 
 Yes. We should probably assume that the Deck he uses from now on is a different one. We'll see when the episode airs.  Cheesedude  ( talk  •  contribs ) 05:41, July 29, 2011 (UTC) 
 Even if Yuma obtains a new Number, he doesn't have to add it to his deck for astral to have it, so the Extra Deck should only include the Numbers he uses. Also, wouldn't it be easier to just put 1 note for all numbers saying "This card was won from a Numbers Holder"?  —This unsigned comment was made by  192.44.110  ( talk  •  contribs ) 14:36, July 30, 2011 201 
 
 That's something I've been meaning to bring up for a while. He only uses Hope and Revise. Terra-Byte was shown in his Extra Deck at one point though, so that should be listed too. The rest could be separated into an "owned cards" list. 
 As for the notes, I prefer one for each. This way it gives you the episode range you would expect to find the card in.  Cheesedude  ( talk  •  contribs ) 18:38, July 30, 2011 (UTC) 
 Seperate Deck Page? 
 The Deck List on Yuma's page is getting quite messy actually. We have 4 decks listed there already (1st deck, Statue Deck, new deck and manga deck). If Yuma duels more opponents with his new anime deck, the list of opponents would be very long and that isn't quite nice to see on character pages. So should we create a "Yuma Tsukumo's Decks" page, like other characters from the other series have? Then it is possible to mention the type of deck Yuma is using here and all the cards, opponents etc. there. That will keep this page nice also.  HellKaiserN  ( talk  •  contribs ) 18:40, August 8, 2011 (UTC)
 
 Sorry, it are 5 decks. I forgot about the Duel Terminal Deck.  HellKaiserN  ( talk  •  contribs ) 18:43, August 8, 2011 (UTC) 
 Yeah, I think a split would be a good idea. Especially with the separate Numbers list, which I do think is a good thing as well.  Cheesedude  ( talk  •  contribs ) 02:29, August 11, 2011 (UTC) 
 Relationship with his sister 
 Yuma's sister no longer forbids him to duel, since he won  Yamikawa . Shouldn't we present this change of her attitude?

 Adding Astral to Relationship section? 
 Could we add him in there? Their relationship seems like it is one of the driving points of the series just as Yugi and Atemu's was for the original series. It seems ashame not to have Astral in it.-- 67.180.124.242  ( talk ) 03:41, August 21, 2011 (UTC)

 Manga Profile? 
 When I was creating an Appearance for  Kagemucha Knight , this article lacked a Manga Profile... Like Yugi, Judai and Yusei have their own Manga article, why not this one get the same? -- F r e d C a t  15:41, March 21, 2012 (UTC)
 
 Because no one bothered to create it yet.  Cheesedude  ( talk  •  contribs ) 16:13, March 21, 2012 (UTC) 
 Relationships 
 Well, I just checked Yuma's page length, and in comparison with the other protagonists of the other series, it is quite long. Only Yugi's page is bigger. That is quite impressive, since ZEXAL has had 60 episodes, while the original series finsished at 224, which means Yuma's page will keep growing.
 Long pages aren't always that nice to read, and Yuma's page is a bit of a mess. It has the things the other pages have (like a seperate deck page, design info), but at the same time, it is not as tidy. We can clean it up (the biography is way more detailed in comparison to for example Yusei's), but that is a lot of work.
 Maybe it is less work to create a seperate page (and category) for Yuma's relationships, which could be quite handy for other characters also. In that case, we could list all relationships there, which would make a lot of pages tidier. Also: it would give us the possibility to discuss character relationships more detailed (Another example: Yuma's relationshiops are for more detailed in comparison to Jaden's). The system is also used on other wikia's.
 HellKaiserN  ( talk  •  contribs ) 16:03, June 19, 2012 (UTC)
 
 This isn't necessarily a problem. The end goal is really to have Judai and Yusei's articles be just as long - and be just as well written as Yugi's. Yuma's page has the distinct advantage of being edited often because his series is still ongoing - which can also be a disadvantage. Important stuff generally isn't excluded, but it also results in many unimportant things being included. It's a real double-edged sword and we saw the same with Yusei's when  5D's  was ongoing. Eventually, it gets chopped back down to size. Yugi and Judai's articles never had that problem, since I believe  DM  was already over when the wiki was created and  GX  was ongoing - but since the wiki had just started, there were way more important things to work on. 
 As for relationships, that's a sore point for me. I really wish we could nuke  every uncited sentence  that refers to relationships. Speculation and reading way too much into little "hints" gets taken as fact. Relationship sections in general need an overhaul.  Cheesedude  ( talk  •  contribs ) 16:45, June 19, 2012 (UTC)

 Zexal-ura? 
 In the episode 66, when Astral and Yuma combined and used the power of Zexal, Tokunosuke said something to the crowd, referring Yuma as a hero named "ZeXaL" but when Tokunosuke announced it, the audience misunderstood him and they referred Yuma and Astral as "ZEXAL-ura". Shouldn't we add both "ZeXaL" and "ZeXal-ura" as nicknames of both Yuma and Astral? -- SharkTenjo  13:53, August 11, 2012 (UTC)
 
 it's possible to be an honor word, like FredCat-sama or whatever, in the Japan; so that's not really necessary. -- i F r e d C a t  14:17, August 11, 2012 (UTC) 
 Fredcat is sort of correct. Its not technically an honor word, but what it is, is that  Flip (character)  in the Japanese version has a tendency to add "ura" after finishing his sentences, so the fans mistook it as zexal-ura since Flip is the only one that does this.  Neos01  ( talk  •  contribs ) 14:29, August 11, 2012 (UTC) 
 Oh, thank you for point that out - I forgot about him over this. -- i F r e d C a t  14:33, August 11, 2012 (UTC) 
 No problem, Flip isn't exactly a memorable character, so it is easy to forget that.  Neos01  ( talk  •  contribs ) 14:41, August 11, 2012 (UTC) 
 Well if you watch the episode, they referred Yuma as "ZeXal-ura" not as an honor word. Yuma was even shocked why there is a "ura". So i think we should put it in their nicknames. Its like "Koron-chan" to which "chan" is part of the name as discussed in Koron-Chan's talk page---- SharkTenjo  15:35, August 11, 2012 (UTC) 
 Dueling Skill 
 I added the bit from episode 98 in with a little bit more detail than the others; I thought it necessary because it was only a single turn in which he was alone, but it wasn't just random OP card effects he was just rattling off, he was actually using pure skill and logical thinking when he did all that; alone those effects were worthless, but together he pulled a narrow save that would've left other duelists in awe; basically it was sort of Yusei's "genius style", a testament to his growth. Not just that; I also put in the thing about him remaining calm because he used to just freak out in this scenario. 
 Basically, the time he spent dueling alone in that episode was too short and too epic to just mention without extra detail.  69.207.190.249  ( talk ) 23:49, April 7, 2013 (UTC)
