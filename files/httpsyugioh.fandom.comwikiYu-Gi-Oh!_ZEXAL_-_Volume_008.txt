 In a futuristic city, augmented reality Duels are all the rage. Duelists, using devices called D-Gazers, can interact and with their environment and their opponents as never before. With more awesome monsters and unbelievable cards, the future of Yu-Gi-Oh! starts right here! [1] 
 A Bond Between Us!! 
 The duel between Yagumo and Ryoga opens a door to another world that pulls in Yuma and his friends. On the other side, they discover that Yagumo is planning to use a black hole to destroy Earth and the Astral World! Yagumo, Ryoga, Kaito and Yuma band together to stop Yagumo, but even their combined strength may not be enough! [2] 
 
 Previously… 
 Yuma Tsukumo is crazy about dueling. One day, during a duel, the charm his parents left him—"the Emperor's Key"—triggered an encounter with a strange being who called himself Astral. Astral was a genius duelist, but his memories had turned into special cards called "Numbers" and were lost. Yuma begins working with Astral to find them! 
 Standing in their way are Dr. Faker, who's trying to use the power of the Numbers cards to destroy the Astral world, and Kaito, who hunting Numbers to save his little brother! Ryoga and Luna are also working to wipe out the Numbers. Meanwhile, Yagumo joins forces with with Dr. Faker and declares war on Yuma and their friends! The Numbers War begins! 
 Yuma's power of believing in people saves Kaito and Ryoga, and a bond begins to form between them. Just then, Yagumo takes Haruto hostage and forces Kaito to fight on his side. Meanwhile, Ryoga also faces off against Yagumo. How will these two duels end? [2]

 Message from Kazuki Takahashi 
 I'm going to driving school! It'd be great if I had my license by the time this volume comes out. Last time, it felt like too much work, so I quit partway through—but this time I'm serious! [2] 
 
 Message from Shin Yoshida 
 We're coming up to the climax of the "ZEXAL" manga! We're at the very peak of the action, but when I think about how soon I'll be have to say goodbye to Yuma, Astral and the rest, my loneliness peaks too! [2] 
 
 Message from Naohito Miyoshi 
 A long time ago, some people more experienced in the industry said that when a manga gets serialized, the artist gains weight… Now I'm experiencing that firsthand! I never go outside anymore… (LOL) But health is important for drawing good pictures! [2]
