 Profile 
 The Juvenile Officers are an organization that serve as enforcers for Duel Academy. Their primary duty is handling the institution's deserters who no longer desire to support the  Arc Project . Due to their status as a detention group, their members are authorized to use force.
 While facing an escapee, they can at best detain the offender and place it through a forceful "correctional program" or downright  seal them into cards  at worst, which is seemingly left to their own discretion.
 Like most members of Duel Academy, their agents Duel their target through ganging, subduing them through numbers. Their rank within the Duel Academy hierarchy is unknown.
 
 Biography 
 History 
 When students attempted to escape from  Duel Academy , the Juvenile Officers are dispatched to capture them. [1]  One day when a female student and  Alexis  escaped from Duel Academy, the officers caught them and  sealed  the girl in a card. Before they managed to seal Alexis away,  Yusho Sakaki  arrived and defeated them. [2]  Since then Alexis has been the only student they had problems catching. [1] 
 
 Heartland City 
 When the citizens of  City  thought  Zuzu  was fugitive from  Duel Academy  three Juvenile Officers chased her. When they cornered her, the officers were about to Duel Zuzu but  Alexis  stepped in and commenced a Battle Royal with the trio. The three Officers all  Fusion Summoned  " Full Armor Canine - Bullfortress " and boosted their  ATK  to high levels. Alexis questioned this as she activated " Machine Angel Ritual " to  Ritual Summon  " Cyber Angel Vrash ", purged the field of the Juvenile Officers' Fusion Monsters with its effect, and attacked all three directly after dealing  effect damage , winning the Duel. [1] 
 
 Deck 
 The Juvenile Officers use  " Armor Canine " Decks , which focus upon  Fusion Summoning  their ace card, " Full Armor Canine - Bullfortress ". They also run large numbers of " Fusion " and " Polymerization " cards to  send  to the  Graveyard  via the  effect  of "Bullfortress" in order to bolster its  ATK  and overwhelm the opponent through sheer force.
