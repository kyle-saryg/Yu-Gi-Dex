 The  World Racing Grand Prix , known as the  World Riding Duel Grand Prix  in the Japanese version, or initialed  WRGP  in both versions, is a prestigious tournament held on  New Domino City  within the series  Yu-Gi-Oh! 5D's  to celebrate the unification of the  Satellite  Sector with New Domino City, the tournament has participants from all over the world competing to be the champion.  
 Unlike standard tournaments though, competitors enter in teams of three and compete one at a time under special rules.  However, underneath the tournament's prestigious and slogan of international unity,  Iliaster  is using the WRGP to fuel their plans to complete the  Grand Design , an action that once completed will destroy New Domino City and alter the future of humanity by summoning the  Divine Temple .

 Sponsoring 
         An advertisement featuring " Phoenix Gearfried ", " Dragunity Darkspear ", " Mirror Force " and the tournament's sponsors.     
 A poster featured in  episode 98  reveals that the tournament was sponsored by several corporations featured in previous  Yu-Gi-Oh!  series, as well as implying that by this time,  Pegasus  had passed away.
 The listed sponsors were as follows: 
 
 Pegasus J. Crawford Memorial Foundation 
 The Bolger & Company 
 Garam  Motors Co., Ltd 
 Manjoume  Digital Entertainment Co., Ltd 
 Senrigan  Network Systems Co., Ltd 
 Schroider  Toys Japan Co., Ltd Cooperation 
 Gameplay mechanics 
 In accordance with the WRGP  Turbo Duels : rather than being a 1-on-1  Duel , it will be conducted through groups and each teams shares a pool of  Life Points  in each Duel, equal to 4000 times the number of  Duelists  on their team. 
 If 1 person on the team loses, all remaining cards on the  field  of that person are moved, if applicable, to the  field  of the next person on the team to Duel, and the turn immediately advances to the  End Phase . The losing player is still on the Duel during the end phase and can activate card effects (if able).
 The  Graveyard  does not move with the other cards.
 After a loss, the losing  Duelist  must reach the next member of their team in order to continue the Duel. If the losing Duelist absolutely cannot reach the next team member (e.g. due to their  Duel Runner  being  destroyed ), the team loses the match. The team also loses if someone tries to help the defeated player reach the pits.
 While a team changes their current player, The other team's  Speed Counters  increase by 1 for each lap their current active Duelist completes during the time it takes for the next  Duelist  to come out. If their Speed Counters reach  12, the maximum, each lap takes away 1 Speed Counter from the other team until it hits 0, which means they lose. This rule only occured in the  Memorial Circuit , since the Turbo Duel tracks used for the rest of the competition were too long for a Duelist to complete more than 1 lap before the other team switches players.
 The matches are Survival Duels, so the winner of each Duel must continue against the next opponent with the same stats he/she finished the last Duel (field, Life Points, hand, removed from play cards, and Graveyard.)
 If a Duelist enters the pits (for any reason) by notice of their team, they lose all Speed Counters but do not lose the Duel or the  Match ; whether or not the remaining person gains Speed Counters per lap in this case is unknown and unconfirmed as of now. 
 If a team decides to switch to the next member while the other team is switching, they continue with the accumulated  Speed Counters .
 Lastly, the Duels will also be done on Manual Mode, rather than auto-pilot.
 It was also because of the WRGP that the unique  Field Spell Card , " Speed World " was upgraded to " Speed World 2 ", which is an official card for this tournament. "Speed World 2" cannot be destroyed.
 
 Preliminary Rounds 
 The preliminary rounds for the WRGP are formed like a league and play in a round-robin style. There are 32 participating teams in total, which are then divided into 8 blocks with each block containing 4 teams. Those teams compete against each other. Originally the 2 top teams in each block would advance further in the tournament, but due to the competition being temporarily suspended to repair the damage to the city done during the Diablo incident, some of the matches were cancelled, therefore only 1 team in each block advanced.
 In Block A, the only teams known to be there are  Team 5D's ,  Team Unicorn  and  Team Catastrophe .
 In the end, the winning teams left, compete against each other in a tournament.
