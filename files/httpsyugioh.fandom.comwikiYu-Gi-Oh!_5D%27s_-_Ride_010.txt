 Sense VS Sense!! 
 
 "Clashing Pride!!"  is the tenth chapter of the  Yu-Gi-Oh! 5D's manga .
 This chapter was first printed on May 21, 2010 in the 07/2010 issue of the  V Jump  magazine. It was later reprinted in the American  Shonen Jump  magazine, and in  volume 2  of the  tankōbon .
 Greiger  vs.  Yusei . Yusei is suddenly put in a tricky situation by a  Fusion  combo. Greiger follows up by Summoning monsters, aiming for a  One Turn Kill .
 
 Summary 
 Sect  arrives at the stadium, wearing at the poncho and wonders if  Yusei  managed to make it on time. He looks up at the scoreboard, which says that  Greiger  and Yusei have 4000 and 1600  Life Points  respectively. He's surprised to see that Yusei's is behind. He yells at Yusei to show everyone the outcome of his special training.  Akiza  looks over at Sect as he does so.
 Greiger vows to crush Yusei in order to get his rematch with  Jack Atlas . Yusei realizes that are both in the tournament for the same reason. Greiger rams  his Duel Runner  into Yusei's and speeds on ahead.
 Greiger Summons " Pump-Action Commando ". The other participants, who are watching, realize that Greiger has not yet used his  Normal Summon  for the turn and due to " Ignition Beast Volcanon ", he has left Yusei's  field  open. "Pump Action Commando's"  ATK  is 1600, which is identical to Yusei's Life Points, they note, so Greiger is going for a  One Turn Kill .
 In  Goodwin's  box room,  Lazar  sniggers that they are going to see a One Turn Kill this early in the tournament.  Mina  reads out some stats on Greiger: He's the Mid-American Champion and is fearfully known as the "Undefeated Giant". Jack smirks and points out that he is not quite undefeated. Mina apologizes and Lazar laughs.
 
         Greiger 's loss to  Jack .     
 Greiger glances up at Jack and in the box room and recalls his defeat to Jack. A flashback shows Greiger lying on the ground with Jack's monster, " The King of Divine Punishment, Dark Highlander " holding its scythe up to his neck. Greiger's cards are fluttering around, while Jack sits nearby on  his Duel Runner . Greiger cannot forget such a day, having his pride stripped away. Jack said that he was disappointed as he had been expecting to face a man called the "Undefeated Giant", but realizes that Greiger is no more than a mere dump. In the present, Greiger believes that he will reach Jack again soon.
 Greiger gets "Pump-Action Commando" to  attack  Yusei  directly . Sect yells out to Yusei. However, Yusei has the situation under control. Since a a direct attack was declared on him, Yusei is able to  Special Summon  " Junk Defender " from his  hand  in  Defense Mode . Greiger continues and has "Pump-Action Commando" attack "Junk Defender" instead. Since its attacking a monster " Pump-Action Commando " gains 400  ATK , bringing it up to 2000. However, Yusei uses " Junk Defender 's" effect to raise its  DEF  to 2000. Since "Pump-Action Commando's" ATK is equal to "Junk Defender's" DEF, neither monster is destroyed. Yusei continues his counterattack. He activates his  face-down  " Backlash ". Since he had a Defense Mode monster that wasn't destroyed in battle, he inflicts 800  damage  to Greiger and draws a card. The audience are surprised that Yusei managed to block Greiger's attack and also inflict damage. Greiger is annoyed by the turn of events and  Sets  a card in his  Spell & Trap Card Zone , ending his turn.
 Yusei Summons " Righty Driver " and uses its effect to revive " Lefty Driver ". "Left Driver's" effect changes its  Level  to 3. Yusei tunes the Level 1 "Righty Driver" with the Level 3 "Lefty Driver" and the Level 3 "Junk Defender" to  Synchro Summon  the Level 7 " Seven Swords Warrior ". Sect is pleased and  Crow  comments that Yusei is doing well.
 
         " Seven Swords Warrior " uses its "Seven Sword Slash" attack to beat " Pump-Action Commando ".     
 Yusei gets "Seven Swords Warrior" to attack, but Greiger plays " Widespread Ruin ". Yusei  chains  " Trap Disposal ", which  negates  "Widespread Ruin" and changes it to an  Equip Card . The rubble from "Widespread Ruin" joins together into a staff, which Yusei equips to "Seven Swords Warrior". Since "Seven Swords Warrior" was equipped with something, its effect inflicts 700 damage to Greiger. "Seven Swords Warrior" continues its attack and uses " Seven Sword Slash " to slice-up "Pump-Action Commando" and destroy it, lowering Greiger's Life Points by another 700, leaving him at 1800. The impact of Yusei's  Sense  causes Greiger's Duel Runner to shake off course a bit.
 Yusei says that he feels sorry for Greiger, since Yusei believes himself to be one who will face reach Jack. Yusei announces that he shall win the  D1 Grand Prix  to reclaim his lost pride. Greiger along with the other contestants realize that Yusei is just like them.  Hunter Pace  says it's a nonsensical reason.
 Yusei Sets a card in his Spell & Trap Card Zone and ends his turn.
 
         Sect  getting shy when  Akiza  speaks to him.     
 Akiza  approaches Sect and asks if he's with Yusei. Sect gets shy and wonders if Yusei knows this pretty lady. Sect starts acting tough and introduces himself as Sect Ijuin, Yusei's rival. Akiza asks him about Yusei's training; If it means he has developed a new  Sense . Sect is stunned and wonders if Akiza has psychic powers. Akiza smiles at him and he says that she is right.
 Yusei and Greiger finish their first lap, leaving with two more. Greiger compliments Yusei on his Sense, but says that he himself shall still be the winner. Greiger activates " Extra Fusion ", fusing " Bombing Beast Fire Bomber " and " Firebird, the Burning Skywing " from his  Extra Deck  to  Fusion Summon  " Blaze Fenix, the Burning Bombardment Bird ". He had been saving his "Sense Pressure" for Jack, he says, but shall use it on Yusei. This sounds interesting to Yusei, who accepts his challenge.
