 Starter Decks  (Japanese: スターターデッキ  Sutātā Dekki ) are pre-constructed decks usually styled after a specific character's Deck, though this does not always ring true.
 As opposed to  Structure Decks , they are made for beginner players to learn how to play the game. As a result, the guides they give are more generally aimed (unlike Structure Decks, which are much more specific). Their content also contains generic, splashable or staple cards, such as " Mystical Space Typhoon " or " Mirror Force ".
 The mat also does not feature the cover monster, but has a general background design. The original Starter decks (before Starter Deck 2006) had 50 cards, but the newest usually have 40-45 cards each.
 The first two, the  Yugi  and  Kaiba  Starter Decks, are each half of the first Yu-Gi-Oh card game product released in Japan, set EX.
