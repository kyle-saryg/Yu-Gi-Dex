 Yu-Gi-Oh! ARC-V 
 In  episode 141 ,  Sylvio Sawatari  uses this card during the Battle Royal  Action Duel  against  Yuya Sakaki ,  Gong Strong  and  Moon Shadow . On the second turn, Sylvio  Normal Summons  this card. It then attacks Yuya's " Performapal Hip Hippo ", its effect doubling its ATK because Sylvio controls no other cards. Yuya finds and activates the  Action Card  " Evasion " to negate the attack. In the  following episode , Sylvio activates his face-down " Abyss Improv ", expecting to nullify Yuya's use of the Action Card " Miracle " through the former's effect, which would increase the battle damage Yuya takes by the ATK of this card and thus eliminate Yuya, but Gong intervenes, discarding " Superheavy Samurai Helper " to make the DEF of the  Defense Position  attack target the same as one " Superheavy Samurai Big Benkei " he controls. On Yuya's next turn, his " Odd-Eyes Pendulum Dragon " attacks this card. Sylvio applies this card's effect again before it is destroyed. On Sylvio's next turn, with the  Pendulum Scales  set at 1 and 8, he  Pendulum Summons  this card from his  Extra Deck , and " Abyss Actor - Superstar " from his hand. He then uses " Abyss Actor - Funky Comedian 's"  Pendulum Effect  to return this card to his  Extra Deck  and boost "Superstar's" ATK by this card's 1100.
