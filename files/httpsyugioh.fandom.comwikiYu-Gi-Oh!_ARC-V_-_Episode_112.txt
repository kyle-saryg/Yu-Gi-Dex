 Featured Duel: Yusho Sakaki vs. Dennis McField 
       Yusho  vs.  Dennis     
 Turn 1: Yusho 
 Yusho   Sets  a card.
 Turn 2: Dennis 
 Dennis   draws  " Performage Fire Dancer ". Dennis  activates  " Performage Mirror Conductor " (   3) and "Fire Dancer" (   6) in his  Pendulum Zones . Dennis  Pendulum Summons  " Performage Ball Balancer " (1000/1800) and " Performage Plushfire " (1000/1000) from his  hand , both in  Attack Position . He then  overlays  his two  Level  4  monsters  to  Xyz Summon  " Performage Trapeze Magician " (2500/2000) in Attack Position. Dennis activates the  effect  of "Trapeze Magician",  detaching  an  Overlay Unit  to let a  monster  he  controls   attack  twice during this  turn 's  Battle Phase . He  selects  "Trapeze Magician". "Trapeze Magician" attacks Yusho  directly  . As a monster Dennis controls attacked, Yusho activates his  face-down  " Miraculous Hats ", letting him  Special Summon  a monster and a  Spell / Trap Card  from his hand in face-down Attack Position as  Normal Monsters  (0/0), without  revealing  them. Dennis can now only attack with one monster this turn, and if the card he attacks is a monster,  battle damage  to Yusho will be doubled, but if he attacks a Spell/Trap Card, no damage will be inflicted. "Trapeze Magician" attacks and  destroys  the first "Hat", the Spell Card " Wonder Balloons "; so no damage is inflicted. "Trapeze Magician" attacks and destroys the other "Hat", the Spell Card " Paper Doll ", which can be treated as a monster while in Yusho's hand. As the attacked card isn't a monster, no damage is inflicted.
 At this point, Yusho and the others escape from Dennis and the Duel Academy Students, leaving the  Duel  with no outcome.
