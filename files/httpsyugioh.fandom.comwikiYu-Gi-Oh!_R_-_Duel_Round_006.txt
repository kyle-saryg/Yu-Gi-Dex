 Summary 
 The man in milatary garb walks towards  Dark Yugi , musing that his friends are always watching over him when he fights. The  Card Professors  don't understand it, but he hears that Yugi is a lot tougher with his friends around. He comments that they need to exclude such uncertain factors, and Dark Yugi realizes that the bobboy trap was the man's doing, and the man introduces himself as  Kirk Dixon , saluting. He comments that Yugi's friends were easy prey; they walked right into the first trap. They would have found a lot more had they made it further, too. Dark Yugi doesn't respond, so Kirk comments that he must be in a hurry, so they should get this underway, and Duel. He grins nastily, asking if Yugi can't fight without his little friends. Still kneeling on the floor, Dark Yugi asks where  Jonouchi  and  Honda  are. Kirk admimts that with all the security traps in the building, he isn't sure which leads where - he could ask the owner. Though if Yugi were to ask Kirk, he's sure they would up right where they belong, like the garbage room. Dark Yugi loses his temper, refusing to let Kirk continue to insult his friends. He'll pay with his defeat. 
 The Duel begins, and Kirk thinks to himself that they'll see if Yugi can keep up with his "warrior deck". Yugi starts, drawing, and then Setting two cards, and Summoning " Alpha the Magnet Warrior " in  Defense Position , ending his turn. He tells Kirk that now it's his turn - bring it on. Kirk snorts, thinking that Yugi should laugh while he can. He plays his own face-down card, and Summons " Machina Soldier ", then activates " Ties of the Brethren " from his hand, allowing him to pay 1000  Life Points  to  Special Summon  " Machina Sniper " and " Machina Defender " from his Deck. Dark Yugi is shocked to see Kirk Summon three monsters in a single turn, but Kirk ends his turn there, as none of his monsters can bring down "Alpha". Dark Yugi draw, thinking that the two Special Summoned monsters can neither attack, or be Tributed, and he wonders what Kirk is doing. He decides that he'll figure it out, Setting another card, and then Tributing "Alpha" to Summon " Dark Magician Girl ". She attacks "Machina Defender" with her "Black Burning" attack, and Kirk comments that that's more like it. He activates his Set " Intruder Alarm - Yellow Alert ", allowing him to Special Summon his 2700  ATK  " Caterpillar Tank " from his hand and redirect the attack to it. Commenting that he hates to see a lovely magician perish so quickly, he has "Caterpillar Tank" counterattack with " Buster Cannon ". Dark Yugi saves his "Magician" with " Spellbinding Circle ", preventing the counterattack, and reducing the "Tank's" ATK by 700. Kirk admits that at the end of the  Battle Phase , "Caterpillar Tank" returns to his hand. 
 He begins his next turn, claiming that this is the ultimate formation of his armed division. He Summons " Commander Covington ", which will keep the " Machina " on his field together. "Covington" raises his hand, and the parts of the three "Machina" combine into a massive four-armed, four legged "Machina", " Machina Force ". The ATK and  DEF  of "Machina Force" are equal to the total of its combined parts - 4600 and 4100 respectively. Paying 1000 Life Points to attack, Kirk does so, and "Machina Force" attacks with "Machine Knuckle", but the attack stops before it can connect. Dark Yugi has activated a face-down card, " Spellbinding Illusion ", which negates "Covington's" ability, and reduces its ATK by 500, as well as preventing "Machina Force" from remaining fused. Then, on Dark Yugi's turn, he activates " Diffusion Wave-Motion ", paying 1000 Life Points himself to have his "Dark Magician Girl" attack all of Kirk's monsters. Kirk is horrified that his army will be destroyed in a single attack, and "Dark Magician Girl" attacks with "Super Magic Wave Bullets" and destroys all of Kirk's monsters, reducing his Life Points to zero. 
 Shellshocked, Kirk drops his cards, as well as the key card, and as Dark Yugi tells him that he's won, Kirk looks at his hands, stating that it can't be; he lost. Before he can make any further comments, he stands on another booby trap that tosses him into a trash can. Dark Yugi remarks that Kirk fell into his own trap, and picks up the key card. The  Millennium Puzzle  glows, and  Yugi  points out that they're fine. They don't know where they are now, but they do know where they're headed. He reminds Dark Yugi of when he said that they would keep winning no matter what. Dark Yugi agrees, walking over to the key card and picking it up. He thinks that  Yako  should just wait. 
 Meanwhile, as Jonouchi and Honda climb a flight of stairs, Kirk falls out of the trash chute into a dumpster, much to their surprise.

 Notes 
 
 ↑   In the  TCG / OCG , " Spellbinding Circle " has no effect on the  target 's  ATK . 
 
 ↑   In the  TCG / OCG , the  effect  of " Commander Covington " being  negated  would not affect " Machina Force ", as it had already been Summoned. 
 
 ↑   In the  TCG / OCG , " Diffusion Wave-Motion " affects only  monsters  of  Level  7 and higher. Dark Magician Girl" is Level 6, so it would not be a valid target.
