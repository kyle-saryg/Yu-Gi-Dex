 Battle Pack 2: War of the Giants  is the second booster set in the  TCG  exclusive  Battle Pack  series.

This set later received a  Round 2  (named  Reinforcements  outside of North America) expansion pack, adapting it for use in the  Draft Format .

 Features 
 For the very first time, the  Egyptian God Cards  are playable as legal  Effect Monsters  with their original artworks. 
 Per the set's name, heavily focuses on using  Normal Summoned / Tribute Summoned   Level  7 and higher monsters to battle, along with numerous cards that focus on changing the outcome of a battle. 
 There are 26  Level  7 and higher monsters in the set. 
 There are only ten Level 5 and 6 monsters in the set, mostly designed to be inherently  Special Summoned  to aid in Tribute Summoning, rather than to be used for battle. 
 Aside from the Egyptian Gods, there are only 10 cards in the set with  effects  that can remove  monsters  from the  field  without having to  destroy  them by  battle . 
 There are only 4 cards in the set that are capable of destroying  Spell / Trap Cards : " Beast King Barbaros ", " Evocator Chevalier ", " Chiron the Mage " and " Photon Wyvern ". 
 There are no  Extra Deck  cards in the set. 
 Breakdown 
 The set contains 215 cards:
 
 50 Rare cards 
 162 Common cards 
 3 Mosaic Rare-exclusive cards, the  Egyptian God  Cards
 All other 212 cards are also available as Mosaic Rare 
 Each pack contains 5 cards:
 
 1  Rare  card (with glossy black title) 
 3  Common  cards 
 1  Mosaic Rare  card (new rarity) 
 Unlike with  the previous  Battle Pack , each card in the pack has an equal chance of being any card in the set with the right rarity; the cards in the set are not ordered into "slots".
 
 Last year we launched Battle Pack: Epic Dawn to rave reviews from our gaming community but this year we are planning to build a set that's bigger, better, and more bad-ass, we've assembled the largest and most powerful monsters ever created, in a carefully constructed tournament environment. Like the first Battle Pack, Battle Pack 2: War of the Giants is designed with sealed play in mind, where Duelists use only their new cards, right out of the packs. War of the Giants is designed to take tactical, skillful play to a level never seen before. 
 High-level monsters have always been popular with Duelists, but their high-risk, high-reward nature has made them risky in tournament play. War of the Giants finally brings these titans front and center, with a game environment designed specifically with them in mind. And since no booster set that's focused on the biggest monsters in history would be complete without them, Battle Pack 2: War of the Giants also includes playable versions of all 3 of the most legendary beasts in Yu-Gi-Oh!: The Egyptian God Cards!

 Trivia 
 Due to this pack's unique construction and the possibility that a player's initial hand might contain too many high-Level Tribute Summon monsters with no way to Summon them, official tournaments conducted using this pack implemented a re- draw  rule where a player could choose to re-draw a new  hand  of five cards at the start of a  Duel , once per  Match  only. [1] 
 " Tyrant Dragon " was originally a candidate for being in this pack, but was rejected due to its underperformance in playtesting. [2] 
 This set debuted the printing of an  archetype condition  for the " Archfiend "  archetype , clarifying " Axe of Despair " as a member of the archetype for the first time. The remaining "Archfiend" cards without "Archfiend" in their English names would receive conditions later in  Legendary Collection 4: Joey's World Mega Pack .
