 Major Events 
 Second Duel of the " Battle City " Semi-Finals. 
 Yugi and Kaiba Duel in a hologram of an ancient Roman coliseum. 
 " Spell Sanctuary " is in play throughout the whole duel, letting both players use face-down Spell Cards as quick play spells 
 When " Slifer the Sky Dragon " and " Obelisk the Tormentor " clash, the power of the Egyptian Gods is revealed:  Battle City 's giant TV screens explode and a vision of the past is displayed to Yugi and Seto's minds. 
 Spanning 6 episodes, this duel and the duel between  Dartz , Yugi, and Kaiba, are the longest in the  Yu-Gi-Oh! anime . 
 When "Slifer the Sky Dragon's" attack misses, it hits the skyline causing lightning bolts to shoot down from the sky. This reactivates the power levels of Seto's blimp, allowing Mokuba to call a helicopter for Joey and activating the broadcast of the Duel on Battle City's giant screens.(episode 130)

Kaiba's hand contains " Lullaby of Obedience ", " Power Balance ", "Obelisk the Tormentor", "Soul Exchange", and " Interdimensional Matter Transporter ". Kaiba activates "Soul Exchange" in order to allow himself to Tribute Yugi's monsters as if they were his monsters. Kaiba plans to Tribute Yugi's "Queen's Knight" and "Alpha the Magnet Warrior" with his own "X-Head Cannon" in order to Tribute Summon "Obelisk the Tormentor", but Yugi activates his face-down "Change of Heart" to take control of Seto's "X-Head Cannon" until the end of the turn. 
 Seto then activates his face-down " Enemy Controller " to pay 1000 Life Points ( Seto  4000 → 3000) and take control of "X-Head Cannon".

 Differences in adaptations 
 When  Joey  dreams about himself dueling, in the Japanese he says he is at "The Domino City Tournament". 
 " Lightforce Sword " is changed from a Magic to a Trap Card in the dub. 
 A shot of  Yugi  looking at his face-down card and wondering if that is the reason that  Kaiba  did not attack him is cut from the dub. 
 In the dub, " XY-Dragon Cannon " is shown on Kaiba's  Duel Disk ; in the Japanese version, " X-Head Cannon " is on the Duel Disk.
