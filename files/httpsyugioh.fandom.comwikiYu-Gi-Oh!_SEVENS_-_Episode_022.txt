 " Cleaning Time! ", known in Japan as " The Sealed Devil " is the twenty-second episode of the  Yu-Gi-Oh! SEVENS  anime. It aired in Japan on October 31, 2020.
 Yuga  and co. use the coupons they got from  Mimi  and enjoy a meal at the  A.I. Restaurant . There, they feel that someone is watching them... and it turns out to be  Arata Arai ! After bringing  Luke  to the dishwashing room, Arai begins a Cheat Duel against him. For some reason, Luke can't use his special power "Luke Devil"...!?
 
 Featured Duel: Lucidien "Luke" Kallister vs. Arata Arai 
 The Duel is conducted as a  Rush Duel .
 Turn 1: Luke Luke Normal Summons " Twin-Edge Dragon " (1000/0), " Dragolite " (1500/0) and " Dragon's Upsetter " (1000/0). He then sets a card.
 Turn 2: Arai Before conducting his normal draw, Arai uses a cheating mechanism to put " Cleanliness General - Big Tidy " on top of his deck, which he then draws. Arai sets a card, then uses the cheating mechanism to swap his set card with " The Bridge on the River Klean ". Arai sends the top card of his Deck to the GY to activate his set "River Klean", letting both players draw a card and if that card is a monster, they can Special Summon it in face-up Defense Position. Arai uses the cheating mechanism to put " Washing Santa Cloth " on top of his deck, which he draws and Special Summons (100/1800). Luke draws " Fire Guardian ", but is unable to summon it because all his  Monster Card Zones  are occupied. Arai activates the effect of "Santa Cloth", letting Luke draw cards equal to the number of monsters he controls and then increasing Arai's LP by that amount x 300 (Arai: 4000 → 4900 LP). This repeats twice, with Arai using his cheating mechanism to activate two more copies of "River Klean", Special Summoning two more copies of "Santa Cloth" and activating both of their effects (Arai: 4900 → 5800 → 6700 LP). 
 Arai tributes two copies of "Santa Cloth" to Tribute Summon "Cleanliness General - Big Tidy" (1000/2600). He activates the effect of "Big Tidy", switching it to Defense Position to send the top card of each player's deck to the GY. If either of the cards sent is a monster, Luke has to send his entire hand to the GY and draw cards equal to the amount sent to the GY by that effect. Before drawing, Arai uses his cheating mechanism to put " Clean Beret - Colonel Mop " on top of his deck, which he then draws while Luke draws " Return of Dragon ". Since one of the players drew a monster, Luke discards his hand and draws 13 cards (Luke's Deck: 22 → 9 cards). 
 Arai tributes "Santa Cloth" and "Big Tidy" to Tribute Summon another "Cleanliness General - Big Tidy" (1000/2600). Arai intends to activate the effect of "Big Tidy" again to make Luke lose via  Deck Out , but since Arai Normal Summoned a Level 7 or higher monster, Luke activates his set " Dragonic Disorder ", letting him send 1 Dragon Normal Monster from his hand to the GY to change "Big Tidy" to face-down Defense Position. 
 Turn 3: Luke Luke activates " Dragonic Pressure ", allowing him to send 3  Dragon  monsters from his hand to the GY to destroy all monsters on the field, and if a monster is destroyed by this effect, Luke can Special Summon a Level 4 or lower Dragon monster from his GY in face-up Defense Position. Luke Special Summons "Dragon's Upsetter" (1000/0) from the GY. Since he controls no other monsters, he activates the effect of "Upsetter" to Special Summon " Dragon's Setupper " (0/1000) from his GY in Defense Position, but his Level 6 or lower monsters cannot attack this turn. Luke tributes "Upsetter" and "Setupper" to Tribute Summon " Shocklead Dragon " (1600/2500). 
 Luke Normal Summons " Dragon's Defender " (300/700) then tributes it to Tribute Summon " Dragon's Keyperson " (400/1900). Luke Normal Summons " Dragon's Striker " (1300/200). Since he controls a face-up "Dragon's Keyperson", the effect of "Striker" lets Luke send one card from his hand to the GY to target 1 face-up monster he controls and increase its ATK by 400 as well as allow it to deal piercing damage this turn. He targets "Shocklead Dragon" ("Shocklead Dragon": 1600 → 2000 ATK). Luke tributes "Keyperson" and "Striker" to Tribute Summon " Thrust Dragon Bunker Strike " (2300/1800). 
 Luke Normal Summons " Phoenix Dragon " (500/500). He activates the effect of "Phoenix Dragon", letting him send one card from his hand to the GY to return " Rush Dragon Dragears " from his GY to his hand. He then tributes "Phoenix Dragon" to Tribute Summon " Justice Dragon " (1200/1200). Luke activates the effect of "Justice Dragon", letting him shuffle 2 Dragon monsters from his GY into the Deck to treat "Justice Dragon" as two tributes for the Tribute Summon of a Dragon monster this turn. Luke tributes "Justice Dragon" to Tribute Summon "Rush Dragon Dragears" (2500/1500).
 "Dragears", "Shocklead Dragon" and "Bunker Strike" attack Arai directly (Arai: 6700 → 4200 → 2200 → 0 LP).
