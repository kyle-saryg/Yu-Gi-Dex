 History 
       The Millennium Scale.     
 Ancient Egypt 
 The Scale was originally owned by  Karim , and after being stolen by  Bakura , was used to resurrect  Zorc Necrophades .
 
 Yu-Gi-Oh! 
 A faction of the  Tomb Keepers  watched over the Scale, along with the  Key ,  Eye , and  Ring . After the Eye and Ring were given to others,  Shadi  kept the Key and Scale.
 In the  first anime series ,  Shadi  uses this to play the  Question of Truth   Shadow Game  with  Kanekura .
 In the  Yu-Gi-Oh! GX  manga , the Scale was used by Karim's predecessor to  judge   Tragoedia 's heart.
 The scale appears with the rest of the items in the artwork of " Ma'at ".
 
 Abilities 
       Thief King Bakura  with the Scale     
 The Scale's power is the ability to weigh a person's sin against the  Feather of Ma'at . Suppose a person lies while being interrogated by the Scale owner or is revealed to be genuinely evil. In that case, the side opposite of the feather will lower, as if weighted down by the person's sins. If the side without the feather drops to the bottom, the person's soul will be eaten by  Ammit , causing death. By placing the Scale close to a person's heart, if the Scale tilts, then the person is noted to have darkness in his heart. The Scale has its limits regarding individuals with highly evil hearts;  Bandit King Bakura  was so evil that the Scale fluctuated when Karim tried to weigh his evil, while the absorbed heart of  Tragoedia  turned the white " Winged Kuriboh " dark.
 This item also contains the power of fusion. It has been shown to Summon  Rabid Horseman ,  Duos Dragon , and  Dragon Master Knight  by fusing  ka .
 
 Trivia 
 Due to the nature of its powers, the Scales did not play much of a part in the   Yu-Gi-Oh! Duel Monsters  anime aside from being revealed to be Shadi's possession in the final season, which is based on the manga's  Millennium World  arc. 
 The use of the scales is similar to the method the Egyptian god Anubis judged souls in the underworld. Should the person fail the test, they would be eaten by a crocodile demon name Ammit. 
 Notes 
 
 ↑   Bakari  as in  Sennenbakari  is the  compound-only voiced form  of  hakari  "measuring; weighing → measuring instrument; scales", which derives from the verb  hakaru  "to measure; to weigh".
