 Design 
 Appearance 
         Téa's design incorporates multiple layers of clothing and a wide range of expressions. Depicted here is the character in her Duelist Kingdom clothing, from the anime, from front, side, and rear views and alongside views of her head from different angles.     
 Téa's character design was overseen by  Kazuki Takahashi .
 In the manga, Anzu originally had a conventional, short hairstyle. Her first color image, seen in  Duel 1 , featured dark brown hair and amber eyes. As Takahashi continued drawing the manga, Anzu gained more feminine and cute facial features. Her hair style became longer and less conventional. Color images from Volume 3 and onward portray her hair as a lighter brown color. Sometimes her eyes are blue and sometimes they are reddish brown. By the final volume of the manga, Anzu's hair touches her shoulders. Anzu's usual outfit is the standard female Domino High School uniform, consisting of a pink coat, a white oxford shirt, a blue tie, and a blue pleated skirt, though she does not stick to any usual casual outfit and wears several throughout the series.
 In the first series anime, her hair and eyes are of a reddish brown color. Her school uniform color differs; her coat is orange and her tie and skirt are green. In the amusement park episode, she wore a light-green bikini.
 In the second series anime, she has brown hair and blue eyes. On occasions she wore the school uniform colored in the same manner as in the manga. Her brown shoulder-length hair is sectioned into two layers, consisting of a darker shade of brown inner layer, with the outer layer of a lighter shade.
 
During the first season of the anime, her usual outfit is comprised of a yellow shirt, which flows like a skirt at her thighs, with a pink waistcoat over it, and a blue miniskirt. A pair of brown knee-high boots completed her ensemble.         Téa Gardner during the Battle City and Virtual World arcs.     In the second and third season, her clothes consists of a light green sleeveless buttoned shirt with yellow collar, pink and blue bracelets, navy shorts with a light blue belt, white thigh-high socks, and blue strapped platform sandals. Prior to being held captive by the Rare Hunters, she also possessed a light yellow handbag. She also wears a yellow tank-top with the word "SPIRIT" on it (which was removed from the dub) and a red skirt on occasion in the second season.
 She also wears another outfit: a yellow tube-top, red choker, light pink shorts, black thigh-high socks, red platform sandals, and a pink jacket. In the fourth and fifth season she wears a black sleeveless shirt that reveals her belly button, a red skirt and a pair of white high-heeled boots. During the trip to  Industrial Illusions , she wears a white jacket over a red tank top, a pleated yellow skirt, and tan boots and she also wears the same outfit at the KC Grand Championship.
 In the 4th season, she wears a yellow jacket, blue shirt, short shorts, cyan socks and blue and white sneakers. In the 4th episode of said season, she wears a black tank top which slightly covers her belly button, navy short shorts with a gray belt, and yellow wristbands.
 In  Yu-Gi-Oh! Capsule Monsters , her clothes consists of a dark pink jacket, light green shirt, with a beige and neck tie, an emerald-green skirt and brown boots.
 
 Personality 
         Téa's more pushy attitude.     
 At the beginning of the manga, Anzu has a spunky, tomboyish personality and was able to scare away Joey (Jonouchi) and Tristan (Honda) after they bully Yugi. She's very kind-hearted, strong-willed and supportive.
 In the second series anime, she is usually shown to be cheering her friends and standing up for what she believes in; it is also shown that she will do anything to help her friends. She plays the role of the strong, down-to-earth, caring, compassionate voice of reason of the group. 
 She is also shown to feel more affection towards Yugi than the Pharaoh in this series (hinted at during the final Duel, and during the Waking the Dragons arc). She is also shown to get easily jealous, such as when Mai (initially), Rebecca and Vivian flirt with Yugi — sometimes to the point where she has an explosive outburst.
 Despite her strong bond of friendship, Téa is not above keeping the others, mainly Joey and Tristan, in line when they get out of control or act foolishly. She often says "I need more female friends", yet she loves them deeply. Because of this, Téa serves as something of a sister-figure to her friends.
 
 Etymology 
 Her Japanese name "Anzu" means "apricot" while her surname "Mazaki" means "Cape of truth".
 Her English dub name "Téa" is a shortened form of "Dorothea" or "Theodora" means "gift of  god" while her surname "Gardner" could be a corruption of the word "guard" or "the one who guards", reflecting her role as Yugi's "guardian" to some degree. It's also possible that her name is a joke on Tea and Gardening.
 
 Biography 
 Duelist Kingdom 
 Téa defeats  Joey  in  Duel Monsters  five times at school, with four of the Duels being offscreen.
 Téa draws symbols on her, Yugi, Joey and  Tristan's  hands to symbolize their friendship before Yugi faces Kaiba, after Kaiba tears up  Solomon Muto 's " Blue-Eyes White Dragon ".
 
         Téa in her Duelist Kingdom anime attire.     
 Téa and  Tristan  sneak onto the boat to  Duelist Kingdom  to support Yugi and  Joey  in the tournament. Téa mostly stands on the sidelines giving the boys encouraging speeches.
 Yugi and his friends faced  Yami Bakura  in a Shadow Game of Duel Monsters, where the players are trapped in cards similar to their  Monster World  pieces. Téa becomes the card " Magician of Faith " in the Duel. As she is upset over Joey's sacrifice, she uses her effect to return " Monster Reborn " to Yami Yugi's hand, which allows him to revive Joey.
 
         Téa working as a waitress in a flashback.     
 As they approached  Pegasus Castle , Tea wonders if there really are two Yugi's. She thinks back to when she first meets Yugi and Joey at  Burgerpalooza . She then wonders what they are doing there and thinks they could get her in trouble since she had to be 18 to work at the restaurant and if they let it slip she is still in school, she'll get fired and won't have enough money to pay for her dance lessons. As she serves Joey and Yugi their food she gives a sinister glare and pours ketchup all over their food. She reveals she wants to study dance in New York but instead of laughing, Yugi and Joey support Téa. The next day Tea gets a letter from Yugi saying they found a warehouse in Spring St. for Téa to use as a dance studio. When she arrives a mugger holds her hostage and Yami Yugi saves her when she blacked out.
 Kaiba defeats Yugi in the tournament by standing on the edge of the castle, so Yugi's last attack would knock him off. Yugi relinquishes the Duel to Kaiba. Téa then argues with Kaiba over his strategy. Kaiba explains how  Duelists  are given one chip and must use it in whatever way allows them to win. Téa argues back that Kaiba only won because he couldn't live without the chip and insists that Yugi won the Duel.
 After losing to Kaiba, Yugi no longer has enough  Star Chips  to enter the tournament finals.  Mai  offers Yugi her excessive Star Chips. Yugi initially refuses, feeling unworthy. Téa Duels Mai for the Star Chips. Using a combination of  Magic Cards , Téa makes her " Shining Friendship " card defeat Mai's " Harpie Lady ". Although Mai is able to turn the Duel around, using " Harpie's Feather Duster ", she is impressed by Téa's performance and wants to give Yugi the Chips, so she surrenders saying "Harpie Lady" was her best monster and Téa defeated it.
 Kemo  doesn't allow Téa, Tristan or  Bakura  to enter the castle, where the finals are held, as they are not finalists, but Mai distracts him long enough for them to sneak in.
 Inside they witness Kaiba and Pegasus Dueling. Pegasus was able to predict Kaiba's moves and easily win. Tristan suspects that Pegasus cheated, so that night he talks with Téa and Bakura on the subject. The three inspect the Duel arena and find a hole that shines moonlight directly at the Duel arena. Tristan spots a tower and the three head towards it. In the tower, they are confronted by Pegasus, who uses his Millennium Eye to transport them to another dimension. They wake up and enter a room, where a  Shadow Game  between two robed men is taking place while others are chanting. The winning man, Pegasus confronts the three and tries to take Bakura's  Millennium Ring . Yami Bakura takes over Bakura's body and sends Téa and Tristan back to their rooms and erases their memories.
 During the final rounds, Téa cheers on Yugi and Joey in their Duels. She is unable to watch the end of Yugi's Duel with Pegasus, as Pegasus takes the Duel to the Shadow Realm. Despite this Yugi feels his friends are with him in spirit and manages to defeat Pegasus.
 Pegasus disappears after the Duel. The gang proceed to a tower, where they find Pegasus' diary, which Téa reads. She learns that Pegasus had a wife  Cecelia , who died and Pegasus was trying to revive her using the  Millennium Items  and  Kaiba Corporation  technology.
 Téa and her friends are taken home by  Seto Kaiba  in his helicopter.
 
 Battle City 
         Téa on her "date" with Yami Yugi.     
 Yugi asks Téa to go out with Yami. After visiting many shops and attractions, they enter an arcade. Inside Téa beats  Johnny Steps  in a dance game. Not taking his loss too well, Johnny later catches up with Yami and Téa, and challenges Téa to another game with a condition: if she loses, she must become his girlfriend. Yami instead challenges Johnny to a game of  Duel Monsters . If he wins, Johnny must leave Téa alone. If Johnny wins, Téa must go on a date with him. Yami reveals himself to be Yugi Muto, towards the end of the Duel Johnny recognizes Yugi Muto as the one who beat Pegasus, causing Johnny to surrender and run. Téa stops him to tell him how quitting isn't going to get him far, and he must keep trying to achieve his goals.
 Afterwards Téa and Yami go to an Ancient Egyptian exhibition to find clues to Yami's past. Here they meet  Ishizu Ishtar , who shows Yami some information about his past as a pharaoh and tells him he must enter the  Battle City  tournament to learn more.
 
         Téa being used as a hostage during Yugi and Joey's duel to the death.     
 During the preliminary rounds of the tournament, Téa accompanies and encourages Joey along the side lines for his Duels, before being captured by the  Rare Hunters  along with Joey. The hunters take them to a warehouse at the docks where they keep them locked in separate rooms. The hunters lock Téa alone inside a compartment filled with cardboard boxes while Joey is tied to a chair in another part of the building. She attempts to escape by standing on some of the boxes so that she reach a window in the room. The boxes can’t support her weight, however, causing her to fall just as her hand reaches the window. Soon later,  Mokuba , who had also been kidnapped by the Rare Hunters, is locked in the same room as her. The two then work together to escape by stacking all the room’s boxes together so that they can climb towards the room’s skylight. As they climb towards it, however, the Rare Hunters enter and begin climbing after them, causing the stack to collapse. Though Téa falls and is restrained by the hunters, Mokuba manages to escape, promising to come back with help to rescue her.
 After this, Téa is possessed by Marik, who turns her into one of his mind slaves to lure the Pharaoh into a Duel with Joey, who is also possessed by  Marik Ishtar . The Duel is set up, so the loser would drown. Téa is made to sit on a chair which restrains her hands and feet while under a large crate hanging from a crane. A push of a button will release the crate and crush her, should Yugi refuse to Duel Joey or anyone else interfere. Téa is then released from Marik's control after she is forced to explain the provisions to the Duel and helplessly tries to help Joey break free of Marik's control several times while also doing her best to remain brave and cheer Yugi on, despite the fact that her own life was in danger. During the duel, Kaiba remote-controls his helicopter to ram the crane into the water in order to save Téa. upon seeing this, the Rare Hunter holding the control to the crate attempts to push the button but is stopped and knocked unconscious by Kaiba. The chopper successfully knocks the crane into the water thus saving Téa’s life. After Mokuba manages to free her from the chair, she joins her friends in attempting to stop  Joey and Yugi’s duel, but are unable to free them in time before both are pulled under the water. When it seems as though both are doomed, Téa drops to her knees in crying despair, only to be shocked and relieved when Yugi rises to the surface and later when Serenity, who has regained her eyesight, rescues her brother from underwater.  
 Téa, along with Tristan,  Serenity  and  Duke Devlin  proceed to the  KaibaCorp  blimp to cheer for Yugi, Joey and Mai in the finals.  Roland  initially refuses to let them board, as they aren't finalists, but Mokuba talks him into letting them on. Despite Joey's objections, all of them take residence in his room for the finals.
 Téa cheers for Yugi and Joey, during their quarter-final Duels. When Joey tells Mai, she wasn't in his dream, which his friends appeared in and jokes about it, Téa seizes him after Mai leaves and tells him off.
 During this time, Marik's spirit inhabits Téa's body and occasionally possesses her, since Yami Marik took over his body, using her to try to talk to Yami Marik and Ishizu.
 
 Virtual World 
 As the blimp traveled to the Duel Tower, it was sucked into an underground lair, by  Noah Kaiba . Téa along with Yugi, Joey, Tristan, Duke Devlin, Serenity, Mokuba and Seto Kaiba emerge from the blimp to investigate. Here they are sucked into the  Virtual World . [5] 
 
         Téa being attacked by a band of Hitotsu-Me Giant hunters in the Virtual World.     
 The gang encounter Noah and  the Big Five , all of whom seek revenge on Seto Kaiba and require a body to return to the real world. In order to do this, they intend on defeating the protagonists in individual duels before downloading their consciousnesses into their bodies in the real world. The Big Five then separate them all, sending them to different environments in the Virtual World. Téa ends up being separated from all the others and finds herself transported to a large canyon in the middle of a desert. As she wanders deeper into the canyon, hoping to find her friends, she ends up being stalked and later attacked by a gang of four  Hitotsu-Me Giants , who believe her to be game for hunting. After spotting one of the  Hitotsu-Me Giants  watching her from the side of a nearby cliff, the giants reveal themselves and surround Téa. She attempts to walk back slowly without agitating the cyclops-giants, but ends up stepping on a loose rock, the noise of which arouses them into attacking her.
 
         An unconscious Téa being carried over the shoulder of a Hitotsu-Me Giant as she is taken into their cave.     
 During the attack, one of the giants furiously throws its large stone axe at Téa. It misses her but kicks up a barrage of small sharp rocks through the air, with one hitting Téa and giving her a small but bleeding cut under her left eye, despite that everything is supposed to be a virtual illusion (In the dub, Tea's blood is censored). Though terrified and reeling from the cut on her face, Téa attempts to flee from the encroaching Hitotsu-Me Giants, with the monsters quickly give chase after her. One of them manages to intercept the fleeing Téa, taking her by surprise and cornering her, before knocking her out with a swipe from its claws.
 
         Téa being held prisoner by her Hitotsu-Me Giant abductors.     
 Immediately afterward, one of the Hitotsu-Me Giants, the presumed leader of the pack, who is responsible for the cut on her cheek, drapes Téa over its shoulder and, with the others following behind, proceeds to carry the insensate girl far across the barren landscape. Eventually, the giants  reach their cave-lair where they intend on having her for dinner. Once inside, the Hitotsu-Me Giant carrying Téa drops her onto the rock surface of the cave's floor, causing her to moan and her body to squirm as the giants amusingly watch her struggle in pain. Eventually, Téa regains consciousness but finds herself trapped on a large stone-shelf while her cyclops captors lurk below. After realizing that they intend to eat her, Téa manages to escape with the aid of a mysterious penguin, who drops down a loose vine so that she may climb out of the pit. The giants, however, notice her escape and once again give chase, driving her towards a rickety old rope-bridge above a river with a powerful current.
 
         The rope-bridge giving out under the combined weight of Téa and the four Hitotsu-Me Giants.     
 Téa is initially too frightened to cross, but through the memory of her friends she gains the courage to cross over. The Hitotsu-Me Giants end up chasing on the bridge as well, but it soon gives out under their combined weight. The giants fall to their deaths and drown in the raging river, but Téa survives by holding onto a surviving portion of the bridge and climbs to the top but she passes out soon afterword. 
 While she's unconscious, Téa has a dream where she and Yugi went to see a show about  Dark Magician Girl , where she is chosen as a member of the audience and gets dressed up in Dark Magician Girl's outfit. She is woken up by the penguin that helped her escape from the giants' lair, which leads her across the Virtual World to a temple made of ice. Inside she meets  Crump  of the Big Five, who has taken the form of the duel monster  Nightmare Penguin  . [6]  there Crump reveals his intention to defeat Téa in a Duel so that he may return to the real world using her body.
 
         Téa faces off against Crump     
 Téa attempts to flee, but Crump imposes a Duel and takes her to an icy region, where both players stand on opposite icebergs in freezing water. Téa is made to assemble a Deck, by selecting from a monitor of cards appearing before her. Though she has played in very few duels, she uses her experiences from her friends' duels to help her pick the right cards to select. After she assembles her deck, Téa must decide on which of the monster cards she selected to be her Deck Master. Remembering her dream, she chooses " Dark Magician Girl " as her own Deck Master, while " Nightmare Penguin " is Crump's. [6] 
 
         Téa almost completely frozen in ice during her Duel with Crump.     
 During the  Duel , as Téa's  Life Points  lower, she becomes engulfed in ice, starting with her feet upon losing her first set of Life Points. [6]  Her deck-master Dark Magician Girl, whose deck-master ability allows her to telepathically communicate with her dullest, helps Téa during the Duel by offering advice, strategy, and emotional support. In much of the duel, Téa manages to hold her own against Crump despite her lack of experience in actually playing the game. Towards the end however, Crump manages to gain the upper hand, causing Téa to loose almost all of her Life Points. By the near-end of the duel, Téa's body becomes almost completely engulfed in ice, with only her head and arms uncovered. When all hope seems lost, Dark Magician Girl steps and shows her how to win. Using her Deck Master's effect and the " Sage's Stone "  Magic Card  to Special Summon " Dark Magician " from Yugi's Deck, Téa is able to defeat Crump as she attacks him with both Magicians. [7] 
 
         Téa tearfully hugging Yugi after she regains consciousness following her duel with Crump.     
 After the Duel, Téa is released from the ice and passes out from exhaustion. Yugi, who had witnessed the last few moments of the Duel, makes his towards her and helps her to regain consciousness. Upon awakening as she is being held in Yugi's arms, Téa tearfully hugs him out of relief, with the young-man clearly flustered by her gesture. The two begin walking through the ice-covered landscape, in an effort to find their missing friends.
 
         Yugi giving Téa his jacket to keep her warm.     
 Unlike Yugi, who is warmer due to wearing long pants and a jacket,  Téa begins to stagger from the sheer cold due to her sleeveless shirt. Seeing this, Yugi then selflessly places his coat on her shoulders to keep her warm despite the cold now taking a toll on him. The two then stop for a while, with Yugi expressing his worries for their other friends, particularly Tristan and Serenity, due to their general inexperience with Duel Monsters. When they proceed walking, they eventually find a door that leads to a virtual courtroom, where Joey is Dueling  Johnson . [8]  The two the proceed to sit among the audience sets and watch as the duel continues. As it goes on, Joey finds himself on the loosing end (secretly caused by Johnson cheating), with all most all of his life points drained. Both Téa and Yugi greatly worry for Joey as he nears defeat, but celebrate when he manages to win in the end. However, when Yugi tells Joey of the threat that the other Big Five members pose to the weaker members of the group, he (Joey) runs off in search of his sister Serenity, with Téa and Yugi following him.
 
         Téa being turned to stone by Noah.     
 Afterwards, the three friends meet up with Serenity and Duke as they are dueling Nesbitt, but Tristan is missing because he lost the Duel. When Téa learns of Tristan’s fate, she falls to her knees in despair. After Serenity and Duke defeat Nesbitt, the gang find that Tristan is trapped as a robot monkey with his real body storing Nesbitt’s mind.  A few Duels happens between Kaiba and Lector, Yugi (Yami) and Joey between all the Big 5 members, Kaiba and Noah which changes to Yugi (Yami) and Noah. During Yugi’s Duel with Noah, the young villain sadistically begins turning all Yugi’s friends into stone statues for every turn in which Yugi is unable to defeat him. Téa is the last among Yugi’s friends standing, having watched in horror as the others were turned to stone before her eyes. Eventually, she is turned to stone as well, but is eventually freed with her friends after Yami Yugi manages to defeat Noah and win the Duel
 
After this Duel, Gozaburo shows up. Then, they all try to escape with Noah's help but he tricks them eventually taking over Mokuba's body and getting out into the real world, first wanting to trap their minds in the virtual world. However he then had a change of heart and realized he was wrong and helped them out instead. When they were all out, they got back to Battle City.
 
 Back to Battle City 
 Battle City continues right after the Virtual World. They arrive at  KaibaCorp  Island where the Battle City finals begin at Duel Tower. Téa supports Yugi and Joey in the battle royal to determine who faces who in the semi-finals.
 
         Worried for his safety after Joey's defeat, Téa begs Yami Yugi not to duel Kaiba.     
 Téa cheers for Joey in his semi-final against Marik and rushes to his aid after he collapses.
 As Yugi prepares to face Kaiba, Téa informs Yami that she would rather he didn't Duel, as she is afraid of what might happen to him, but Yami tells her he need to Duel Kaiba to Duel Marik so he can save the world and she understands and lets him go. She stays back with everyone to try and help Joey but is still cheering Yugi on.
 
         Tea, possessed by Marik, battling Yami Marik.     
 Near the end of Yugi and Kaiba's Duel Joey wakes up and at first doesn't remember anything but slowly does. Then he asks Téa if Yugi started the Duel yet.She tells him he did and Joey wants to go immediately. Just then the doctors show up,but Joey demands to go and Téa tells him not to because so many people got hurt and he was just in critical condition. Joey says he made a promise to Yugi and he has to be there for him which reminds her of what Yami told her before his Duel. Then Joey, Téa, Duke and Tristan go to the Duel Tower just in time to see the ending of Yugi's Duel.
 Since Yugi won he moves onto the finals to Duel Yami Marik but first Joey challenges Kaiba to a Duel to see who gets third place. Before the Duel starts Marik takes over Téa's body so he can go talk to Ishizu. He then tells Ishizu that he needs to confront Yami Marik and runs off to the Duel Tower to do so. Yami Marik is already up there trying to figure out what happened during Yugi and Kaiba's Duel then he gets annoyed and throws the rod, which lands near Téa. She picks it up and is holding it up at Yami Marik while Marik is talking to him. Yami Marik ends up getting the rod back, and he tries to get rid of Marik with the rod. Then Ishizu comes up just in time to stop him. Marik then tells Ishizu to forget about him and stops taking control of Téa. She is knocked out for a while, and Yami comes up to find out what happened to Téa and starts talking to Yami Marik, and he eventually leaves. Yami then talks to Ishizu about what was going on, and Téa wakes up, not knowing what happened. Yugi decides not to tell her about how Marik was taking control of her. They go back down to see how Joey's Duel was going, and they tell her that he lost, so they get ready for Yugi's Duel with Marik.
 
         Téa celebrates the end of Battle City with Serenity and her friends.     
 Yami's Duel with Yami Marik begins, and everyone is worried about how this Duel will turn out. Téa is cheering Yugi on the whole time but is worried because Yami Marik was able to stop Slifer the Sky Dragon and make a copy of Obelisk the Tormentor. Also, every time Yami loses life points Yugi is slowly being sent to the Shadow Realm and the same with the good Marik every time Yami Marik loses life points. During the Duel, Marik took over Téa again, this time to encourage Yami to in the duel even though victory would cost Marik his life, but he eventually went back into his own body, leaving Téa confused about what just happened, although she quickly got over that and focused on the Duel. Then Odion shows up, which gives Marik the strength to take over Yami Marik for a little while so Yami could win the Duel. Even though the Duel was finally over, Kaiba said they should get off the island because he was going to blow it up.

 Pyramid of Light 
   This section  may require  cleanup  to meet this wiki's standards. 
   The following events from  Yu-Gi-Oh! The Movie: Pyramid of Light  are of disputed canon. 
 The movie starts out with Yugi, Joey, Téa, and Tristan at school. They were just leaving when the noticed a big crowd of people. When they went to see what it was all about, it turned out to be a group of people wanting to Duel Yugi. Joey tells Téa to get Yugi away from such a situation. They run out of the crowd and notice people are scattered everywhere looking for Yugi. Téa noticed the museum, thus they hide in there. She tells Yugi that no one would look there for them. Yugi notices his grandpa there so they go over to talk to him. They talk about a new artifact that was just brought to the museum, the Pyramid of Light. After they look at that, they go over to one of the mummies, Anubis, and there was writing in the display. Yugi's grandpa reads it and as he finishes it there was a blinding light which showed Yugi a Duel with him and Kaiba. In this particular duel, Kaiba gets hurt. Téa wakes Yugi up and he asks her to stay with grandpa so he can go see Kaiba and they notice the mummy and the Pyramid of Light was gone.
 The next time you see Téa and Grandpa, they are walking and they see the Kaiba Dome explode with a beam of light. They rush over to see what's going on, when they get there they see a huge blue pyramid. Mokuba tells them Kaiba and Yugi are in there Dueling. Téa hops they are okay. The ground begins to crack and just in time Pegasus came with a helicopter and saves them. Téa feels that her friends need her help so she stands in the edge of the helicopter and looks into the eye of the Pyramid of Light which separated her mind from her body and she almost falls but Pegasus, Mokuba, and grandpa bring her back in. Her mind is sent into the Millennium Puzzle like Yugi's, Joey's and Tristan's. When she first gets there she is floating in the air and starts talking to them about there friendship symbol she drew on them in the first episode. There are mummies below her and she falls down. She is a afraid of the mummies so Joey and Tristan help her by beating them up but it doesn't work because they are already dead. Eventually they are surrounded but Yugi saves them by throwing a dagger at the eye in the wall.
 Téa wakes up next to Joey and Tristan and Yugi is back with Yami. The card Pyramid of Light was destroyed by Yami so they could see the Duel. Téa, Joey, Tristan, Pegasus, Mokuba, and grandpa cheer him on. Yami is now facing Anubis because Kaiba is knocked out. Anubis loses but he sends out a real monster and Kaiba wakes up and they have to defeat it. Téa and everyone else has to leave because it was to dangerous. Yugi and Yami defeat the monster with a card of Kaiba's, he was unable to do anything because he was hurt so he gave the card to Yugi. Once the monster was defeated everyone started talking to each other. Kaiba and Mokuba leave and Yugi talks about friendship and lastly he talks to Yami.
 
 Waking the Dragons 
 Téa is on the roof of the school wondering why Yugi left early. Joey and Tristan come up; they're wondering the same thing. They end up finding Yugi at the museum. Later they find out that someone stole the Egyptian God Cards. Yugi has a Duel with Gurimo, which is where they learn about the Seal of Orichalcos.
 The next day they run into  Rebecca , and she calls Yugi her boyfriend, which Téa doesn't like. She takes them to see  Professor Hawkins ,who starts talking about how the monsters coming to life could have something to do with Atlantis. After that, everyone heads home.
 Later they're all at Yugi's house. Yugi gets a package from Pegasus with a video. Pegasus asks Yugi to come and see him right away. The next day they go on a private jet then in a limo. The limo breaks down so they have to walk for a while, Téa is able to get a driver to stop and give them a ride to Industrial Illusions.
 Later on, they are on a train to Florida, but the train splits apart, separating Téa and Yami from Joey and Tristan. Most of the time Téa is trying to help Pharaoh from being upset about Yugi while she herself is also upset. After a while they just focus on finding Joey and Tristan. They are reunited later when Kaiba's plane crashes and then they are all taken back by Kaiba's helicopter to try and stop Dartz.
 Kaiba's company was taken over by Dartz. Joey runs off to Duel Valon and Mai. While Joey Duels, Tristan, Téa, and the Pharaoh go to look for him, but when they find him he already lost his soul.
 After Pharaoh's Duel with Rafael the gang goes to Dartz in Kaiba's helicopter. Kaiba and the Pharaoh Duel Dartz; after Kaiba loses the Duel the Pharaoh continues while Téa, Tristan, and Mokuba are unconscious.
 The Duel is won by the Pharaoh. Yugi, Kaiba, and Joey come back and Mokuba, Tristan, and Téa wake up. Seeing Yugi back they have a group hug. Then they're off to finish off Dartz. Téa wishes Yugi good luck as he, along with Joey and Kaiba, have their final battle with Dartz.
 
 Grand Championship 
 Téa does not have a prominent role in the  Grand Championship  arc, but as always, she is Yugi and Joey's cheerleader throughout their Duels. 
 Téa also meets and despises  Vivian , because of her feelings for Yugi. She also develops a habit of saying the line "I need some female friends" whenever the others start getting on her nerves.
 
 Capsule Monsters 
   This section  may require  cleanup  to meet this wiki's standards. 
   The following events from  Yu-Gi-Oh! Capsule Monsters  are of disputed canon. 
 In the beginning of Capsule Monsters, Téa is seen with Yugi playing the Capsule Monsters board game. When  Joey  wins four tickets to India, Téa has a bad feeling about the trip.
 Later, while on the plane, Téa is seen looking out the window saying that  "There's nothing but nature for miles" .
 Yugi says to himself that Téa is more excited about this trip then anyone else.
 Later in the series, after they enter the Capsule Monsters world, all Téa wants is to go home.
 Upon being chased, she releases " Happy Lover " from a capsule and uses it to revitalize Tristan's " Thunder Kid ". She later releases " Dark Witch " from another capsule when the gang are being attacked by " Wood Remains " and " The Wandering Doomed ".
 Téa was entrusted with a magic pendant, where each section would change color every time the gang passes a test. During the second test she stayed behind to take care of Yugi, who was exhausted from the first test. During the fourth test, as she was attacked by a " Jirai Gumo " She managed to unleash a " Seiyaryu " and attacked "Jirai Gumo".
 
 Dawn of the Duel 
 Téa, Tristan and Joey accompanied Yugi to Egypt so they could help the Pharaoh figured out his memories. She also had noticeably had a change in clothing, and was now wearing white heels, a red skirt and a black sleeveless top. The Pharaoh presented the Egyptian God cards to the Tablet of Lost Memories, and was pulled into the Shadow RPG, where he would find out his memories. However, after discovering that Yami Bakura followed him, the gang went after Yami. 
 Later, Téa figured out that the key to stopping Bakura was to tell the Pharaoh his real name, as it was also the key to unlocking his memory. The gang was betrayed by Tristan, who was possessed by Bakura and almost killed, but jumped to a cliff and saved themselves. Téa pulled Yugi up, who was hanging onto Joey and then both her and Yugi saved Joey. When they found Tristan, he revealed that he had been possessed by Bakura and Dueled Yugi. 
 Téa noted that Yugi had to Duel without Yami. Yugi still won, though. When they found Yami, they gave him his name by thinking of the symbols and putting them on a necklace-like item. Yami then remembered who he was and revealed that his true name was Atem. Atem was then able to Summon  The Creator of Light  to destroy  Zorc Necrophades . The gang then returned to the real world.
 
 Ceremonial Battle 
 Téa is mostly seen torn with the idea of Atem passing on the spirit world. As she believes that, though he deserves to reunite with those in his past and finally achieve peace, she also doesn't want him to leave because of the feelings she has for him. Thus, she usually appears having this mental debate within herself, with the outcome ending in her crying. However, whilst dealing with this emotional turmoil, she displays a happy facade to the rest of the group, especially around Yugi and Atem.
 During the beginning of the Duel, she outwardly supports Yugi to win but inwardly wishes Atem to be victorious so that he can't leave. However as the Duel progresses she increasingly cheers on Yugi to the point where she shocks herself on how she changed sides of who she wanted to win.
 However though Yugi won the Duel in the end, her feelings for Atem had not weakened and she is saddened to such an extent of the possibility of him leaving, that just as the spirit of the Pharaoh is about to pass through the gates of the afterlife, she tries to run after him however her attempt is stopped by Joey. All witnesses of said last match then look up at the sky in Egypt ending the anime once the last words are spoken.
 
 Yu-Gi-Oh! GX 
         Téa,  Yugi ,  Joey ,  Tristan  and  Kaiba  on the Battle City V2 Flyer     
 Téa is never mentioned in  Yu-Gi-Oh! GX  but for a brief moment she can be seen on a flier that  Jaden Yuki  picks up, along with  Yugi ,  Joey ,  Tristan  and  Kaiba . [9]  As this is seen when  Jaden Yuki  had traveled to the past, it therefore places Battle City V2 after  Battle City  but before the  Ceremonial Battle .

 Romance with Yugi Muto and Yami Yugi 
 Téa is Yugi's close friend, but is uncertain if it is the Pharaoh or regular Yugi that she loves more. Even though in the manga and first series anime she has been best friends with Yugi since childhood, she is unaware that he is in love with her.
 During the first chapter in the manga, she hung out with Yugi instead of playing basketball like the rest of the girls. In another manga chapter (Duel 45: 13 O'clock Terror!), when on a date with Yugi, Téa tries to bring out Yami (thinking that if she goes to extreme measures and plays a joke on Yugi, he will change into Yami). She makes Yugi fearful for her safety by going on a Ferris Wheel when it was known that a bomber was in the park; she was "pretending" to be in danger so she could "make the Yugi she wants to appear", not knowing that she placed herself in danger of being blown up for real. She is rescued by Yami Yugi, so her ploy succeeds in the end.
 In the manga and the anime for much of the series, Téa believes that Yami Yugi is a more mature personality of regular Yugi. While at Duelist Kingdom, Yugi tells Téa that he "knows" that she prefers Yami Yugi. When he offers to switch out with Yami Yugi to give them time alone, Téa stops Yugi and tells him that there's no need because Yugi and Yami Yugi are both Yugi, so there's no need for him to change, as she really cares for both "personalities". It is only later on in the series when Yugi is in the hospital after trying to save Yami Yugi that she finally accepts the fact that Yugi and Yami Yugi are two separate people, but in the second series anime she knows they are two different people. This, then, causes confusion as to who Téa is really in love with: Yugi Muto or Yami Yugi.
 The last references to this in the anime are during the final Duel, when Téa wishes Atem to be victorious so she does not have to say goodbye to him, but also roots for Yugi without even realizing it. She also does have friendly feelings toward the original Yugi as it is shown in many episodes when Rebecca Hawkins hugs Yugi, Téa appears upset; though this is before she accepts that Yugi and Yami are two alter egos with separate personalities. Téa has also hugged Yugi on two occasions during the second series anime - Once during the Virtual World Arc, after she beats Crump in a Duel after being nearly encased in ice and Yugi comes to her aid, and again during the Waking the Dragons Arc after Yami Yugi defeats Dartz, and Yugi's soul is returned to his body, along with Kaiba's and Joey's. Both of these cases occur during anime-only arcs in the story as neither the Virtual World arc or the  Waking the Dragons  arc are present in the manga. However towards the end of the fifth season though she is still seen unable to decide for her affections greatly reside in either Yugi Muto or Yami Yugi, however after the Ceremonial Duel and Atem walks through the Gates of the afterlife she is seen trying to run after him however stopped by Joey. She does really care about Yami and has genuine and intense romantic affection for him too.
 However, in the Japanese anime credits, the gang returns back home. Rebecca is seen embracing Yugi, and Téa is still annoyed. This shows that whichever Yugi it may be, Yami Yugi or Yugi Muto, she has romantic feelings and affections for both of them, although she never has had the courage to actually confess her strong romantic feelings to either Atem or Yugi.
 
 Decks 
 Main article:  Téa Gardner's Decks 
 Téa uses a Deck full of mostly  Fairy  cards, but in the  Virtual World  arc, she played with a Deck mostly made of  Spellcasters . Like  Mai Valentine , most of her monsters are female-related. She combines her Spell Cards with Monster Cards to boost the overall strength of her monsters and she uses Trap Cards like " Waboku " and " Mirror Force " to protect her monsters from harm. She  Duels  once in the manga and seven times during the course of the second anime series (four of which were off-screen).
 
 Trivia 
 Although Téa's Dueling skills are slightly better than mediocre compared to others, she is the only character in the  Yu-Gi-Oh!  franchise who never lost a Duel she participated in; beating  Mai Valentine  alone and even besting  Crump  of  The Big Five  (though she had help from  Dark Magician Girl  when facing the latter). Knowing this, Tristan seemed to have taken her place in Capsule Monsters. Serenity and Mokuba are too insignificant to count. 
 Téa is the only female lead who has never Dueled against the  main protagonist  of her series. She does, however, play Capsule Monsters with Yugi in which the former was winning.
