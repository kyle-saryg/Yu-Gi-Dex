 Summary 
 Dark Yugi  thinks that he and  Kaiba  will fight in Battle City. Kaiba looks down at Yugi, and he tells Yugi to wait for him, thinking that their rivalry will overcome fate.
 Ishizu  declares her  Battle Phase , ordering " Zolga " to attack " Des Feral Imp ." "Zolga's" " Cape of Deadly Wind " slices Kaiba's monster apart, and Kaiba furiously thinks that that was his only defensive monster. Ishizu's " Kelbek " then attacks Kaiba directly, reducing him to 1350  Life Points . Kaiba angrily thinks that he's had enough. Ishizu Sets a card and she ends her turn.
 Remembering what happened on his last turn, Kaiba knows that Ishizu's face-down card, or the card she just drew, is probably a trap to destroy " Crush Card ." He knows that he has to step in,  knowing there's a trap, he must endure this. He'll pay Ishizu back for this humiliation by trampling her with " The God of the Obelisk ." He draws, and sure enough, Ishizu activates another  Trap Card , a second " Muko ," sending the drawn "Crush Card" to the Graveyard. Kaiba thinks that he knew it. Down on the sidelines,  Jonouchi  observes that Kaiba's Deck was switched with the cards in his Graveyard; Ishizu knows all the cards in Kaiba's Deck. He's in bad shape. Dark Yugi thinks that there's always a chance, mentally urging Kaiba to ignite the light of hope in his eyes. But Ishizu thinks that the light is already out.
 Kaiba looks at his hand, thinking that his one chance is " Soul Exchange ," a  Spell Card  that lets him sacrifice the monsters on Ishizu's side of the field. Then he can Summon a high-Level monster. Ishizu has two monsters on the field. On her next turn, when she Summons a third monster, "Obelisk" will come to life and eat their souls. Noting Ishizu's 1400 Life Points, Kaiba Sets his "Soul Exchange, " but Ishizu knows it's there. She thinks that the game will end on Kaiba's next turn, just as her vision foretold. Kaiba ends his turn. Jonouchi is surprised at Kaiba's actions, pointing out that Kaiba doesn't have any monsters on his side; if Ishizu's monsters attack, Kaiba's dead. Dark Yugi realizes that Kaiba must have his "Soul Exchange," but he thinks that Ishizu knows it's coming. 
 Ishizu takes her turn and she draws. She plays a face-down card, and Kaiba irritably wonders what it is this time. Ishizu thinks that it is the greatest trap Kaiba will ever fall in; the Trap Card " Blast Held by a Tribute ." The card plants a bomb on one of her monsters, hiding it under "Zolga's" cape. A monster that is Summoned using "Zolga" as a sacrifice, even a God, will be destroyed the moment it attacks. And all Kaiba's God's attack power will strike back at Kaiba, and pierce his heart. Ishizu Summons a third monster,  " Agido ." 
 Kaiba seizes his chance, now that there are three sacrifices on Ishizu's field. He activates "Soul Exchange," sacrificing Ishizu's three monsters and he thinks that he'll show her God. He tells "The God of the Obelisk" to obey him, and the massive blue-skinned giant rises up behind him.  Dark Marik  and Jonouchi both observe "Obelisk" for the first time,  while Dark Yugi thinks that Ishizu doesn't have any monsters left to defend herself, wondering if Kaiba turned the tables that easily. With "Obelisk" looming over the field behind him, Kaiba declares that on his next turn, God's fist will shatter Ishizu's future. Closing her eyes, Ishizu ends her turn, thinking that when the "Giant God" moves, its task is done.

Kaiba draws " Crush Card ," but Ishizu activates her Set " Muko " to send "Crush Card" to the  Graveyard . Kaiba Sets " Soul Exchange ." 
 Turn 10: Ishizu 
Ishizu draws, and then she Sets " Blast Held by a Tribute ." She selects "Zolga" as the target for the  Trap Card . If "Zolga" is  Tributed , the Tribute Summoned monster will gain the effect to be destroyed when it declares an attack, and inflict its  ATK  to the controller's  Life Points . Ishizu  Normal Summons  " Agido " in  Attack Position . (1500/1300) Kaiba activates his Set "Soul Exchange," allowing him to Tribute up to three of Ishizu's monsters for a Tribute Summon. He Normal Summons " The God of the Obelisk " in Attack Position. (4000/4000)
