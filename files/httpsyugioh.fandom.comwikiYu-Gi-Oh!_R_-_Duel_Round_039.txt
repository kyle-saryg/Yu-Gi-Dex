 Summary 
 " The Wicked Eraser 's" " Digestive Breath " strikes " Arcana Knight Joker ," who fends the attack off with it's shield as it's boiled away.  Dark Yugi  is shocked that "Arcana Knight Joker" was destroyed in just one attack as "The Wicked Eraser" closes its beak.  Kaiba  and  Gekko  watch the "Eraser" in shock, thinking that this is "The Wicked Eraser." Kaiba asks Gekko if that's  Yako 's third God. He muses that "The Wicked Eraser's"  ATK  is determined by the number of cards on the other player's field. For a God, it isn't very self-sufficient. He snorts, commenting that he knew it, "Eraser's" nothing more than a false God. Gekko is worried by the statement, and thinks his brother's name. The attack has reduced Yugi to 2800  Life Points , while Yako is on 2100, as the latter Sets a card to end his turn. 
 Dark Yugi thinks, so this is "The Wicked Eraser". Right now all he has on the field is a single face-down card. If he puts a  Monster Card  on the field, the "Eraser's" ATK will jump to 2000. In that case, he'll use this. He plays " Big Shield Gardna " in  Defense Position , boosting Yako's "Eraser" to 2000 ATK; not enough to break through "Big Shield Gardna's" 2600  DEF . Yako laughs softly, commenting that Yugi must be so pleased with himself, stopping a God with a  four-star  monster. Does he really think that'll work. Dark Yugi and his supporters are shocked, as Yako explains that "The Wicked Eraser" is a being that erases everything; even other Gods. Yugi thinks he can defeat the "Eraser", but Yako will erase his arrogance instead. Arrogance, Dark Yugi asks. Yako draws, asking if it's his turn. 
 Telling Yugi to watch this, he adds his card to his hand and then points into the air - declaring that he's  sacrificing the "Eraser" . Dark Yugi and Gekko are floored, and Kaiba is shocked that Yako is sacrificing his own God. Yako laughs madly as "Eraser" begins to disappear, becoming a whirling tornado of black ash that begins burning away the cards on Yugi's field. Yako explains that when "The Wicked Eraser" goes to the  Graveyard , it takes all the other cards on the field along with it. As Dark Yugi's cards begin to burn he looks horrified that they're vanishing. A demonic form descends from the tornado, and Gekko explains that " Gaap the Divine Soldier " is a  six-star  monster; Yako used the  Wicked God  as a sacrifice to Summon it. And thanks to the "Eraser's" effect, Yugi's field is completely empty, so "Gaap's" attack can't fail to get through. 
 Yako adds that in addition, if he reveals the  God - Type  monsters in his hand, "Gaap's" ATK is boosted. He comments that the only God-monster in his hand is this one - " The Wicked Avatar ." Gekko is horrified to see that Yako already had the God in his hand. Yako explains that his "Avatar" gives "Gaap" strength as "Gaap's" ATK is increased from 2200 to 2500. Yako Sets a card, and declares that his God will guide "Gaap" straight to Yugi, its aim is unerring. Dark Yugi growls inwardly, as Yako tells Yugi he's coming, ordering "Gaap the Divine Soldier" to  attack directly . "Gaap's" second set of arms slash at Dark Yugi, and he gasps as his Life Points are reduced to 300 in a single attack. 
 Then a card floats out of his Graveyard, and Yako protests in shock that all of Yugi's face-down cards should have been erased. Yugi explains that it was the card that "Eraser" sent to the Graveyard, and when it's sent to the Graveyard, he can activate a  Spell  or  Trap Card  from his hand. The card he's activating is " Stairway to the Underworld ." The card summons the dark ones, the "Emissaries of Darkness": " Gorz " and " Kaien ". Yako is horrified - a second ago, Yugi had lost everything, and now he's Summoned two  seven-star  monsters. He grits his teeth, thinking that this is the Duelist who defeated Master  Pegasus . Gekko thinks that he knew Yugi could do it, but he's only closed the gap; Yako's still on equal footing with him. Kaiba is impressed as well; Yugi took a bad hit, but he survived, and now he's taken the lead with two seven-star monsters. But, Dark Yugi thinks, lurking in Yako's hand is another Wicked God. 
 Yugi draws, thinking that even so, the Wicked Gods are  ten-star  monsters. To Summon one, he'll need three monsters to use as sacrifices. Setting a card, he and Yako face off, and Yako wonders if this is it. Yugi thinks that he has to keep Yako from Summoning the "Avatar," and "Gorz the Emissary of Darkness" attacks, slaying "Gaap the Divine Soldier." Yako is reduced to 1900 Life Points. Dark Yugi declares a direct attack with "Kaien," and Yako plays his Trap Card, " Intruder Alarm - Yellow Alert ." He  Special Summons  a monster from his hand to shield him, " Tellus the Little Angel ," who is split in half by "Kaien" with ease. Yako reminds Yugi that although "Tellus" is dead, it leaves a wing on the field. Dark Yugi is surprised that Yako didn't use "Yellow Alert" to call out the Wicked God and take down one of the "Emissaries of Darkness," rather than use "Tellus" as a shield. " Tellus Wing " floats on the field as Yako laughs, asking if Yugi hears it. The pulse of the Wicked God is getting louder. 
 As Dark Yugi reacts in shock, Yako draws, and activates " Multiply " from his hand, splitting his "Tellus Wing" into three. Gekko protests that it can't be, to think that Yako would get three sacrifices so easily. Yako tells Yugi that now another Wicked God will manifest itself towards him, laughing madly as he sacrifices his three monsters, telling Yugi to look and despair as he Summons "The Wicked Avatar," the dark sun appearing above him and his right eye bulging.
