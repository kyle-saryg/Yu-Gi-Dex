 Featured Duel: Yuga Ohdo vs. Nail Saionji 
 Turn 1: Yuga 
 Yuga Normal Summons " Dark Sorcerer " (1500/0) and " Stray Familiar " (0/1400), then tributes them to Tribute Summon " Bascule the Moving Fortress " (0/2500). Yuga activates the effect of "Bascule", sending the top three cards of his deck to the GY to switch it to Defense Position and then Special Summon 1  EARTH  Normal Monster from his GY. He Special Summons "Stray Familiar" (0/1400) in Defense Position. He then sets 2 cards.
 Turn 2: Nail 
 Nail Normal Summons " Femtron " (1400/100), then tributes it to Tribute Summon " Picock Hightron " (1600/100). Since he controls no other monsters and has "Femtron" in his GY, Nail activates the effect of "Picock Hightron", sending it to the GY to draw 2 cards and then send the top 2 cards of his Deck to the GY.  Nail Normal Summons " Yoctron " (100/100). Since "Femtron", " Attron ", and " Zeptron " are in Nail's GY, Nail returns them to the bottom of his Deck in any order to activate the effect of "Yoctron", sending it to the GY and drawing three cards, then sending three cards from his hand to the GY. He then sets a card.
 Nail Maximum Summons " Yggdrago the Heavenly Emperor Dragon Tree ", " Yggdrago the Heavenly Emperor Dragon Tree [L] ", and " Yggdrago the Heavenly Emperor Dragon Tree [R] " (Max. 4000/0). Yuga activates his set Trap " Magiquartet Shock ", letting him shuffle 4 Normal Monsters from his GY to his Deck to destroy 1 monster Nail controls. He targets "Yggdrago", but the effect of "Yggdrago" prevents it from being destroyed by Trap effects. Nail activates the effect of "Yggdrago the Heavenly Emperor Dragon Tree [L]", sending the top three cards of his Deck to the GY to destroy 1 level 8 or lower monster Yuga controls. He destroys "Bascule". He then activates the effect of "Yggdrago the Heavenly Emperor Dragon Tree [R]", sending the top three cards of his Deck to the GY to switch 1 Defense Position monster Yuga controls to Attack Position. He targets "Stray Familiar". 
 "Yggdrago" attacks and destroys "Stray Familiar", but Yuga activates his set Trap " Trick Guard ", sending the top card of his Deck to the GY to reduce all Battle Damage to 0 since Nail declared an attack while Yuga controlled a face-up monster with 0 ATK. 
 Turn 3: Yuga 
 Since Yuga has no cards in hand, he draws five cards. Yuga sets a card. Yuga then Maximum Summons " Super Magitek Deity Magnum Over Road ", " Super Magitek Deity Magnum Over Road [L] " and " Super Magitek Deity Magnum Over Road [R] " (Max. 3500/0). 
 Duel continues in the next episode .
