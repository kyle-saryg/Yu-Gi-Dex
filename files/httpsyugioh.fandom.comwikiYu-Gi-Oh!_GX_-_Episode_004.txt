 Summary 
   This summary is currently incomplete. 
 A fleet of naval vessels was making its way towards  Duel Academy , with the captain of the lead vessel stating that they were delivering a new batch of cards for the Academy's card shop.
 It's also the day of promotion exams. Students of the same dorm  duelled  each other, with the winner possibly being allowed to advance to the next dorm up. A written test came first, then the practical exam.  Jaden Yuki  was late for the exam, and encountered an old woman attempting to push her van up the hill towards  Duel Academy . He stopped to aid her. The new cards arrived; however, all but one pack was bought by a single individual. The owner of the card shop,  Ms. Dorothy , gave Jaden a few cards she saved as repayment for helping her with her van earlier.
 The person who bought all the cards was  Dr. Crowler . He decided to give the cards to  Chazz Princeton , and revealed that he will pull some strings so that Jaden and Chazz will face each other in the practical exams rather than someone from their own dorms. The Duel began with Chazz gaining an early advantage with the " VWXYZ " series, while Jaden played defensively. Ultimately, Jaden won using Winged Kuriboh (which had all the girls infatuated by his cuteness) and the " Transcendent Wings " card he got from Ms. Dorothy, which lets him evolve " Winged Kuriboh " into " Winged Kuriboh LV10 ".  Chancellor Sheppard  intended to promote Jaden to  Ra Yellow  for his impressive win, but he declined, preferring to stay in  Slifer Red  with his friends instead.
 
 Featured Duel: Jaden Yuki vs. Chazz Princeton 
 
 This Duel uses  Yu-Gi-Oh! GX  anime gameplay . Rules and  card effects  may differ from that of the  TCG / OCG . See the individual card articles for more information.     
 Turn 1: Jaden 
 Jaden   draws  " Winged Kuriboh ". He then  Normal Summons  " Elemental HERO Clayman " (800/2000) in  Defense Position .
 Turn 2: Chazz 
 Chazz  draws " Magical Mallet " and subsequently  activates  it to  return  it and four other cards from his  hand  to his  Deck  and draw five new cards. One of the drawn cards is "Magical Mallet", so Chazz activates the latter card again to return it and two other cards to his Deck and draw three new cards (one of which is " V-Tiger Jet "). 
 Chazz Normal Summons "V-Tiger Jet" (1600/1800) in  Attack Position . He then activates " Frontline Base ". Now  once per turn , during Chazz's  Main Phase , he can  Special Summon  a  Level  4 or lower  Union Monster  from his hand. Chazz then activates the effect of "Frontline Base" to  Special Summon  " W-Wing Catapult " (1300/1500) in Attack Position. Chazz then  removes  "V-Tiger Jet" and "W-Wing Catapult" from play to Special Summon " VW-Tiger Catapult " (2000/2100) in Attack Position. He then activates the  effect  of "VW-Tiger Catapult" to  discard  " Y-Dragon Head " and switch "Clayman" to Attack Position. "VW-Tiger Catapult"  attacks  and  destroys  "Clayman" (Jaden: 4000 → 2800 LP). Chazz then  Sets  a card.
 Turn 3: Jaden 
Jaden draws. He then Normal Summons " Elemental HERO Sparkman " (1600/1400) in Defense Position and Sets a card.
 Turn 4: Chazz 
Chazz draws. He Normal Summons " X-Head Cannon " (1800/1500) in Attack Position. Chazz then activates the effect of "Frontline Base" to Special Summon " Z-Metal Tank " (1500/1300) in Attack Position. He then activates his  face-down  " Call of the Haunted " to revive "Y-Dragon Head" (1500/1600) in Attack Position. Chazz then removes "X-Head Cannon", "Y-Dragon Head", and "Z-Metal Tank" from play to Special Summon " XYZ-Dragon Cannon " (2800/2600) in Attack Position. Chazz then removes "VW-Tiger Catapult" and "XYZ-Dragon Cannon" from play to Special Summon " VWXYZ-Dragon Catapult Cannon " (3000/2800) in Attack Position. 
 Chazz activates the first effect of "VWXYZ" to remove "Sparkman" from play. "VWXYZ" then attacks  directly , but Jaden activates his face-down " A Hero Emerges " to force Chazz to  select  a card from Jaden's hand. If it is a  monster , he can Special Summon it. Chazz chooses a card and Jaden reveals it to be " Elemental HERO Burstinatrix ", so Jaden Special Summons "Burstinatrix" (1200/800) in Defense Position. A  replay  occurs and Chazz uses "VWXYZ" to attack "Burstinatrix". Chazz then activates the second effect of "VWXYZ" to switch "Burstinatrix" to Attack Position. "VWXYZ" destroys "Burstinatrix" (Jaden: 2800 → 1000 LP).
 Turn 5: Jaden 
Jaden draws " Transcendent Wings ". He then Normal Summons "Winged Kuriboh" (300/200) in Defense Position and Sets a card.
 Turn 6: Chazz 
Chazz draws. "VWXYZ" attacks "Winged Kuriboh", but Jaden activates his face-down "Transcendent Wings" to discard two cards in his hand and  Tribute  "Winged Kuriboh" to Special Summon " Winged Kuriboh LV10 " (300/200) from his Deck in Attack Position. Jaden then activates the effect of "Winged Kuriboh LV10" to Tribute the latter and destroy "VWXYZ" as well as inflict  damage  to Chazz equal to the  ATK  of "VWXYZ" (Chazz: 4000 → 1000 LP).
 Turn 7: Jaden 
Jaden draws " Elemental HERO Avian " and subsequently Normal Summons it (1000/1000) in Attack Position. "Avian" then attacks directly (Chazz: 1000 → 0 LP).
 
 Trivia 
 Crowler was wearing a hat and trenchcoat similar to Jotaro Kujo from Jojo's Bizarre Adventure Stardust Crusaders. 
 Differences in adaptations 
 The shot of a nameless Slifer Red asking himself how somebody like Jaden could have defeated Crowler during the written exam is removed from the dub. 
 In the dub, Jaden states that the reason he turned down promotion to the Ra Yellow dorm is because he would no longer be with Syrus if he accepted. In the original, he simply prefers the Slifer Red dorm.
