In the  following episode , Ghost Gal activates this card, equipping " Altergeist Primebanshee " with it to prevent "Primebanshee" from being attacked, or targeted by other card effects. A second copy of this card is then  excavated  from Ghost Gal's Deck and sent to the Graveyard by her "Secret Cure"  Skill . Playmaker then uses the effect of " Scan Doll ", paying 1000 Life Points to activate this card from Ghost Gal's Graveyard. He equips this card to Ghost Gal's " Altergeist Silquitous ". This allows Playmaker's monsters to bypass "Silquitous" and attack Ghost Gal directly, which is how he wins the duel.
