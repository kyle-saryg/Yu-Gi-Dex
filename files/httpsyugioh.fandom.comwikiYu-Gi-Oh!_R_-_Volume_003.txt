 Message from Kazuki Takahashi 
 Lately I've been learning how to draw pictures with a computer. I never had a head for digital things, so I've been having lots of trouble, but it's still fun. If you get a chance to look at them, please do! [2] 
 
 Message from Akira Ito 
 Just a little while into the New Year, I got sick and was hospitalized for about three weeks. I caused a lot of trouble and worry for the readers, Mr. Takahashi and everyone involved in this project. I never thought I'd be responsible for a "series suspended due to creator's sudden illness" notice. That was a shock. [2]

 Story 
 When the tenth grader Yugi solved the ancient Egyptian Millennium Puzzle, another spirit took up residence in his body…Yu-Gi-Oh, the King of Games! Using his gaming skills, Yugi fought ruthless adversaries like Maximillion Pegasus, the multimillionaire creator of the collectible card game Duel Monsters, and Seto Kaiba, the teenager president of Kaiba Corporation. After winning the Battle City tournament, Yugi acquired the most powerful cards in the world: the three Egyptian God Cards "Slifer the Sky Dragon," "The God of the Obelisk" and "The Sun Dragon Ra", which were created by Pegasus based on a mysterious ancient Egyptian card game. 
 But now a new enemy has appeared. Yako Tenma of Industrial Illusions, Pegasus's company, has made a hostile takeover of Kaiba Corporation and challenged Yugi to a duel. To ensure Yugi's participation, he has kidnapped Yugi's friend Anzu, intending to use her for the diabolical R.A. Project…resurrecting Pegasus's spirit in Anzu's body. To rescue Anzu, Yugi and his friends rush to Kaiba Corporation skyscraper. Inside, they are attacked by the "Card Professors," Tenma's henchmen. But Gekko Tenma, Yako's brother, has joined forces with Yugi to stop his brother's madness… [2] 
 
 In the Next Volume… 
 It's a battle for the heart of KibaCorp—and the soul of Anzu! Gekko and Yugi fight against Richie and his gunslinger deck, while deeper within the building, Kaiba faces Yako—and Yako's evil gods! Will gods or dragons reign supreme? And will anyone be able to stop the "R.A. Project" as the spectre of Pegasus is summoned at last…?
