 Summary 
 A small boat is floating in the ocean near  Duel Academy . In it is a coffin, which opens to reveal a female vampire.  Jaden Yuki  awakens in the infirmary while recovering from his  Shadow Game  with  Nightshroud , and its revealed that the previous scene was a dream of his. He asks how  Alexis' brother  is, and  Nurse Fontaine  tells him that he's still unconscious, but should be fine. Jaden's dream appears to have really been a vision of a current event, as the vampire releases a horde of bats, vowing not to be defeated as Nightshroud was. Rumors soon being circulating about the presence of the vampire, and  Chancellor Sheppard  warns the holders of the  Spirit Keys  to be on their guard.  Chazz Princeton ,  Bastion Misawa  and  Zane Truesdale  all attempt to prepare themselves for the imminent confrontation, but are unaware that each is being spied on by a bat, who then relay the contents of each of their Decks to the vampire.  Vellian Crowler  is skeptical, while  Professor Banner  hangs numerous cloves of garlic from the ceiling of his room. The bats report back to the vampire, and she selects Zane as her first target, appearing to find him quite attractive.
 
       Camula  with " Vampire Bat " and " Zombie Werewolf ".     
 Chumley Huffington  later reports he saw the vampire down at the lake, and all of the key holders besides Jaden and  Alexis Rhodes  gather there. A red carpet is rolled out above the water, and Chazz, Zane and Bastion deliberate who will Duel first. Crowler and Banner both slink backwards, not wishing to Duel, though the bump into each other, and Crowler jumps forwards. Under the impression that he is volunteering, the others agree with the choice. He eventually agrees, and Chumley runs to the infirmary to inform Jaden, Alexis and  Syrus Truesdale . The vampire finally approaches them from down the red carpet, but appears disappointed that her opponent isn't Zane. She introduces herself as  Camula  and explains that that the loser's soul will sealed inside a doll. The Duel begins, with her wielding a gold  Duel Disk  in the shape of a bat's wing. She Summons " Zombie Werewolf " in  Attack Position  and  Sets  a card to end her turn. Crowler believes she is using the weak monster as bait for her face-down  Trap Card  and activates " Ancient Gear Castle " before Summoning " Ancient Gear Soldier " in Attack Position. The attack of the latter is increased by the effect of the former, and Crowler attacks, as "Ancient Gear Soldier" prevents the opponent from activating Trap Cards during the  damage step . Camula reveals the effect of her "Zombie Werewolf" - when its  destroyed in battle , she is permitted to  Special Summon  another copy of it from her  Deck , with an attack increase of 500. Crowler Sets a card to end his turn.
 Camula chides Crowler, and Summons " Vampire Bat " in Attack Position, whose effect increases the attack points of all  Zombie - type  monsters by 200 points. "Zombie Werewolf" attacks and destroys "Ancient Gear Soldier", while "Vampire Bat" attacks  directly . Crowler is reduced to 2700  Life Points , and realizes he is feeling real pain. Camula offers Crowler the chance to switch with Zane, and he declines, stating that she will have to through him before laying a finger on any of his students. Crowler activates his face-down " Damage Condenser ", which lets him Special Summon a monster from his Deck with attack points equal to or less than the damage he took this turn. He Summons another "Ancient Gear Soldier" in attack position, and begins his turn,  Tributing  it to Summon " Ancient Gear Beast ". Crowler attacks, but the others object, reminding him of "Zombie Werewolf's" effect. Crowler reveals that "Ancient Gear Beast" will  negate  the effects of monsters it destroys in battle, and the attack continues, with "Zombie Werewolf" being destroyed. Camula draws, and plays " Infernalvania ", which lets her discard a Zombie-type monster to destroy every monster on the field. She discards " Vampire Lord ", but "Vampire Bat" is immune to destruction should Camula send another copy of it from her Deck to the Graveyard. She does so, and every other monster on the field is destroyed. She attacks directly, ending her turn. Crowler collapses, and Zane wishes to step in, but Crowler urges him back. Camula calls Crowler weak, and Jaden arrives with help from Chumley. He tells Camula that he knows Crowler isn't weak, as he's  dueled him .
 
       Dr. Crowler 's soul sealed inside of  Camula 's doll.     
 Crowler rises to his feet and begins his turn, Summoning " Ancient Gear Golem ". He reveals that he will require no Tributes, as two " Ancient Gear " monsters have been  Normal Summoned  since "Ancient Gear Castle" was played, so it may substitute for them. Crowler attacks, reducing Camula to 1200 Life Points due to "Ancient Gear Golem's"  piercing  effect. However, she discards a "Vampire Bat" from her Deck to retain the one she had the on the  Field . In an effort to prevent the effect of "Infernalvania" from being used again, Crowler plays " Heavy Storm " destroying all Spell and Trap Cards on the field. However, Camula's  face-down  " Zombie Bed " triggers upon its destruction, letting her Summon another "Zombie Werewolf" from her Deck. Everyone questions how she is able to predict Crowler's every moves, and she reveals that she used her bats to spy on everyone. Camula plays " Book of Life ",  removing  the "Ancient Gear Beast" in Crowler's Graveyard from play to Special Summon the "Vampire Lord" in her's. She immediately removes him from play to Special Summon " Vampire Genesis ", in Attack Position, who receives a 200 point boost from "Vampire Bat". Realizing he's lost, Crowler tells his students never to give up, and to believe in themselves, and that the power of light can destroy darkness. Camula destroys "Ancient Gear Golem" with "Vampire Genesis", and then attacks directly with "Zombie Werewolf" and "Vampire Bat", winning the Duel. Camula takes Crowler's Spirit Key, and his soul is transferred into the doll. However, she does not want the doll, and simply drops it to the ground. Camula vanishes along with her bats, back to her castle, but tells them that soon they'll receive an invitation for another Duel.
 
 Featured Duel: Vellian Crowler vs. Camula 
 
 This Duel uses  Yu-Gi-Oh! GX  anime gameplay . Rules and  card effects  may differ from that of the  TCG / OCG . See the individual card articles for more information.     
 Turn 1: Camula 
Camula draws " Zombie Werewolf " and subsequently Normal Summons it (1200/1200) in  Attack Position . She then  Sets  a card.
 Turn 2: Crowler 
Crowler draws. He then  activates  " Ancient Gear Castle ". Now all " Ancient Gear " monsters will gain 300  ATK  while "Ancient Gear Castle" will gain 1  Counter  whenever Crowler Normal Summons or Sets a monster. If Crowler Tribute Summons a monster he can substitute "Ancient Gear Castle" for a Tribute(s) if the number of counters on "Ancient Gear Castle" is greater than or equal to the number of Tributes required. He then Normal Summons " Ancient Gear Soldier " (1300 → 1600/1300) in Attack Position. Due to this card's effect, Camula is forbidden from activating any Spells or Traps when it attacks until the end of the Damage Step. "Ancient Gear Castle" gains one Counter due to its effect. 
 "Ancient Gear Soldier" attacks and destroys "Zombie Werewolf" (Camula 4000 → 3600). Since "Zombie Werewolf" was  destroyed in battle  and sent to the  Graveyard , its effect activates, allowing Camula to  Special Summon  another "Zombie Werewolf" from her  Deck  in Attack Position (1200/1200) and increase its ATK by 500 (newly summoned "Zombie Werewolf": 1200 → 1700/1200). Crowler Sets a card.
 Turn 3: Camula 
Camula draws. She then Normal Summons " Vampire Bat " (800/1200) in Attack Position. Due to this card's effect, all  Zombie - Type  monsters that Camula controls will gain 200 ATK while "Vampire Bat" is on the field  ("Vampire Bat": 800 → 1000/800; "Zombie Werewolf": 1700 → 1900/1200). "Zombie Werewolf" attacks and destroys "Ancient Gear Soldier" (Crowler 4000 → 3700). "Vampire Bat" attacks  directly  (Crowler 3700 → 2700). Crowler then activates his face-down " Damage Condenser " to Special Summon another "Ancient Gear Soldier" (1300 → 1600/1300) in Attack Position (as its ATK is equal or less than the combined  Battle Damage  Crowler took this turn).
 Turn 4: Crowler 
Crowler draws " Heavy Storm ". He then  Tributes  "Ancient Gear Soldier" in order to Tribute Summon " Ancient Gear Beast " (2000 → 2300/2000) in Attack Position. "Ancient Gear Castle" then gains one Counter, giving it a total of two. "Ancient Gear Beast" attacks and destroys "Zombie Werewolf" (Camula 3600 → 3200). Due to the effect of "Ancient Gear Beast", the effects of "Zombie Werewolf" are  negated  when "Ancient Gear Beast" destroys it in battle, so Camula cannot Special Summon her third "Zombie Werewolf" from her Deck.
 Turn 5: Camula 
Camula draws " Infernalvania " and subsequently activates it. Now during each player's  Main Phase , that player can  discard  a Zombie-Type monster from their hand to  destroy  all monsters on the  field , but that player will be forbidden from doing a Normal Summon or Set this turn. Camula then activates the effect of "Infernalvania" to discard " Vampire Lord " and destroy all monsters on the field. Camula then activates the second effect of "Vampire Bat" to send another "Vampire Bat" from her Deck to the  Graveyard  and prevent "Vampire Bat" from being destroyed. "Vampire Bat" attacks directly (Crowler 2700 → 1700).
 Turn 6: Crowler 
Crowler draws " Ancient Gear Golem " and subsequently Normal Summons it (3000/3000) in Attack Position by Tributing "Ancient Gear Castle". "Ancient Gear Golem" then attacks "Vampire Bat", but Camula sends another copy of "Vampire Bat" from her Deck to the Graveyard to prevent her "Vampire Bat" from being destroyed, however she still takes Battle Damage (Camula 3200 → 1200). Crowler then activates " Heavy Storm " to destroy all  Spell  and  Trap Cards  on the field. Since " Zombie Bed " was destroyed and sent to the Graveyard while it was face-down on the field, its effect activates, allowing Camula to Special Summon "Zombie Werewolf" (1200 → 1400/1200) from her Deck in Attack Position.
 Turn 7: Camula 
Camula draws. She then activates " Book of Life " to Special Summon "Vampire Lord" from her Graveyard (2000 → 2200/1500) in Attack Position and remove from play "Ancient Gear Beast" from Crowler's Graveyard. Next Camula removes from play "Vampire Lord" in order to Special Summon " Vampire Genesis " (3000 → 3200/2100) in Attack Position. "Vampire Genesis" attacks and destroys "Ancient Gear Golem" (Crowler 1700 → 1500). "Zombie Werewolf" and "Vampire Bat" then attack directly (Crowler 1500 → 100 → 0).
