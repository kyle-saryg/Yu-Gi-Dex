 " Rushing for Ramen ", known in Japan as " Sorry for the Noodles! Ramen Duel! " is the sixth episode of the  Yu-Gi-Oh! SEVENS  anime. It was scheduled to first air in Japan on May 9, 2020, but it has been delayed to June 13, 2020, due to the  2019–20 coronavirus pandemic . [1] 
 Rush Dueling has been spreading throughout the city thanks to the Seventh Elementary newspaper. When Yuga and his friends check the news, they find out that their favorite restaurant will be closing, so they head there in order to eat its famous ramen before it closes! However, they'll have to face Menzaburo the Gourmet Duelist in a never-before-seen Ramen Duel over the restaurant owner's last ramen!
 
 Featured Duel: Yuga Ohdo vs Menzaburo Oomori 
 The Duel is conducted as a  Rush Duel .
 Turn 1: Menzaburo 
Menzaburo's  hand  contains " Art of Masked Fiery Noodle Scorching Burner ", " Art of Masked Fiery Noodle Cooking Pot ", " Masked Fiery Noodle Jonin Gockboot ", " Masked Fiery Noodle Ninja Barikata ", and " Masked Fiery Noodle Ninja Chiji Red ". Menzaburo  Normal Summons  "Barikata" (Level ?/1000/1200) and "Chiji Red" ( Level  ?/800/1000). He then  tributes  "Barikata" and "Chiji Red" to Tribute Summon "Gockboot" (Level ?/2200/0). He then  sets  2 cards.
 Turn 2: Yuga 
Yuga Normal Summons " Dark Sorcerer " (Level 4/1500/0) and " Stray Familiar " (Level 1/0/1400). He then tributes "Dark Sorcerer" and "Stray Familiar" to  Tribute Summon  " Sevens Road Magician " (Level 7/2100/1500). Yuga  activates  the effect of "Sevens Road Magician", allowing him to send the top card of his  Deck  to the  GY  to increase the  ATK  of "Sevens Road Magician" by 300 for each monster with a different  Attribute  in his GY. He sends " Curtain of Sparks " to the GY, and there are 2 monsters with different Attributes ("Sevens Road Magician": 2100 → 2700 ATK). Since a Level 7 or higher monster Yuga controlled activated its effect, Menzaburo activates his  face-down  "Art of Masked Fiery Noodle Cooking Pot"  Normal Trap Card , allowing him to  decrease  the ATK of a monster Yuga controls by 1000 and gain 500  LP . He chooses "Sevens Road Magician" ("Sevens Road Magician": 2700 → 1700 ATK; Menzaburo: 4000 → 4500 LP). Yuga sets 2 cards. At the end of the  turn , the effects of "Cooking Pot" and "Sevens Road Magician" expire ("Sevens Road Magician": 1700 → 2100 ATK).
 Turn 3: Menzaburo 
Menzaburo activates " Art of Masked Fiery Noodle Drawing-Out-The-Rich-Tasty-Flavor Reversal "  Normal Spell Card , allowing him to send cards from his hand to the GY equal to the number of  Normal Monsters  in his GY to draw an equal number of cards. There are 2 Normal Monsters, so he sends " Silent Doom " and " Tribute Doll " and  draws  2 cards. Menzaburo Normal Summons a second "Barikata" and a second "Chiji Red". Menzaburo activates the effect of "Gockboot", allowing him to send the top card of his Deck to the GY to increase the ATK of all  Pyro  monsters he controls by 100 for each Normal Monster in his GY until the end of the turn. He sends an unknown card to the GY, and he has 2 Normal Monsters in his GY ("Gockboot": 2200 → 2400 ATK; "Chiji Red": 800 → 1000 ATK; "Barikata": 1000 → 1200 ATK). Menzaburo activates his set "Art of Masked Fiery Noodle Scorching Burner" Normal Spell Card, allowing him to increase the ATK of all Pyro monsters he controls by 100 for each Normal Monster in each player's GY until the end of the turn. Both Yuga and Menzaburo have 2 Normal Monsters in their GY ("Gockboot": 2400/0 → 2800/0 ATK; "Chiji Red": 1000 → 1400 ATK; "Barikata": 1200 → 1600 ATK).
 Menzaburo activates " Art of Masked Fiery Noodle Heartburn-Inducing Pork Roast Fat " Normal Spell Card, allowing him to decrease the ATK of a monster Yuga controls by 400 for each Pyro monster he controls until the end of the turn. He chooses "Sevens Road Magician", and Menzaburo controls 3 Pyro monsters ("Sevens Road Magician": 2100 → 900 ATK). Menzaburo Sets 1 Card. "Gockboot" attacks "Sevens Road Magician", but Yuga activates his face-down " Magic Fire Guard ", allowing him to prevent an Attack Position Spellcaster monster he controls from being  destroyed  by battle this turn. He chooses "Sevens Road Magician". The attack continues, but "Sevens Road Magician" is not destroyed (Yuga: 4000 → 2100 LP). "Barikata" and "Chiji Red" attack "Sevens Road Magician" (Yuga: 2100 → 1400 → 900 LP).
 Turn 4: Yuga 
Yuga's hand contains " Road Magic - Explosion ", " Road Magic - Tempest ", " High Magic - Double Accel ", " Answerer the Demonic Swordsman ", and " Windcaster Torna ". Yuga activates the effect of "Sevens Road Magician", sending an unknown card from the top of his Deck to the GY. There are 2 monsters with different Attributes in Yuga's GY ("Sevens Road Magician": 2100 → 2700 ATK). Menzaburo activates his face-down "Cooking Pot", choosing "Sevens Road Magician" ("Sevens Road Magician": 2700 → 1700 ATK; Menzaburo: 4500 → 5000 LP). Since Yuga controls a Level 7 or higher Spellcaster monster, he activates "Road Magic - Explosion" Normal Spell Card, allowing him to send a  FIRE  monster from his hand to the GY to inflict 400 damage to Menzaburo for each card he controls. Yuga sends "Answerer" to the GY, and Menzaburo controls 3 cards (Menzaburo: 5000 → 3800 LP).
 Since Yuga controls a Level 7 or higher Spellcaster monster, he activates "Road Magic - Tempest", allowing him to send a  WIND  monster from his hand to the GY to change the  battle positions  of up to 3 monsters Menzaburo controls. Yuga sends "Windcaster Torna" to the GY and changes "Gockboot" to Defense Position. Yuga activates "High Magic - Double Accel", allowing him to return 2 Level 5 or higher Spellcaster monsters from his GY to his Deck to increase the ATK of a Spellcaster monster he controls by its original ATK. He returns "Answerer" and "Windcaster Torna" and increases the ATK of "Sevens Road Magician" ("Sevens Road Magician": 1700 → 3800 ATK). Yuga activates his face-down " Piercing!
