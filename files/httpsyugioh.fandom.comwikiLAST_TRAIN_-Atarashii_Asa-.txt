 Looking out over the great beyond,  
I've simply noticed how small my field of view is. 
 
It would be easier to just give up on myself,  
but I wanted to stick it out the best I could. 
 
No matter how bad today may be, 
you just gotta spark up...  
that little bit of light, tomorrow,  
the way you would next time. 
 
So that it still goes on, so that it never fades, I'll make certain of myself, 
and even if I get hurt more times than I can count,  
I'll run with my wishes to a sure tomorrow coming  
through a now-or-never today... 
 
So that it still goes on, so that it never fades...
 
 
 
 Today's the day to carry out a plan. 
I'll finally escape from my saturated life today 
 
I don't know what is going on today 
But somehow I feel that my answer isn't here 
 
Though I don't know how my life will end, 
I never wanna be a slave 
'Cause there is always the chance to change 
I guess it's up to you 
 
I'm trying to be a better person 
I will get on the train 
I don't wanna become a slave 
I will live for myself 
I'm trying to be another me 
'Cause I won't lose my life 
My life will succeed 
I'll reach my goal 
 
I try to smile but I can't remember how 
I don't know 
please tell me, how'd I become so Jaded? 
 
Sometimes I feel like I might be dead soon 
But I know that it gave me something to believe 
 
Though I don't know how my life will end 
I never wanna be a slave 
'Cause there is always the chance to change 
I guess it's up to you 
 
I'm trying to be a better person 
I will get on the train 
I don't wanna become a slave 
I will live for myself 
I'm trying to be another me 
'Cause I won't lose my life 
My life will succeed 
I'll reach my goal 
 
I'm waiting for my dawn 
I'm dreaming of freedom 
Nobody Knows my worries 
No need to understand me 
I wanna get this small freedom 
I break away my worries 
 
It's time to say goodbye 
I'm not afraid of you 
I need to walk away 
'Cause I don't wanna be a liar 
If I cannot live my life, 
I am as good as dead 
 
I'm trying to be a better person 
I will get on the train 
I don't wanna become a slave 
I will live for myself 
I'm trying to be another me 
'Cause I won't lose my life 
My life will succeed I'll reach my goal 
 
My new story 
My life is just about to start 
 
I'm trying to be a better person 
I will get on the train 
I don't wanna become a slave 
I will live for myself 
I'm trying to be another me 
'Cause I won't lose my life 
My life will succeed 
I'll reach my goal
