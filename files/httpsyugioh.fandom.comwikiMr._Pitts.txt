 Mr. Pitts  (unnamed in the Japanese version) is the chief editor at the newspaper  Carly Carmine  freelances for. In the English version, he also has Carly make coffee for him and regards that as her more important job.
 Despite Carly not actually working for his paper, he has threatened to fire her on multiple occasions, as she fails to get the "scoops" she promises. In the English version, he fired her once and after her second failing called her to his office to re-fire her.
 In the English version, he is distrusting of  Rex Goodwin . He also tends to prefer celebrity gossip (or "dirt" as he calls it) to actual news.
