 Mr. Ryuga  is a teacher trainee assigned to Duel fifty students at  Duel Academy . On the condition that he could defeat them all, he would be recognized as an official professor of the school. He however had bigger plans in store once he became a professor. He is rumored to take the cards of those he defeats. When he Duels, he cheats by using a  special ring  to emit an electromagnetic force that disables his opponent's  Duel Disk , preventing their use of  Spell Cards . He challenges  Jaden Yuki , but the Duelist defeats Ryuga with his " Alternate Fusion "  Trap Card . Afterward, the ring broke and he lost his chance to become a teacher at Duel Academy.
 
 Deck
