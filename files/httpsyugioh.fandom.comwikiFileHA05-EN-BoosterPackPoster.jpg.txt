 OCG  Booster Packs contain 5 cards each, whereas  TCG  packs contain 9 cards. 
 
 TCG 
 Each main series Booster Pack is  guaranteed  a  Rare , 7  Commons , and a ninth card which will either be another Common or a foil card ( Super Rare  rarity or higher).
 As of  Breakers of Shadow , the ninth card is guaranteed to be at least a Super Rare, with a 1:6 chance of it being an  Ultra Rare  and a 1:12 chance of it being a  Secret Rare . This also applies to side series sets such as  High-Speed Riders  and  Wing Raiders . Previously, the chances of a single pack containing a Super Rare was 1:5, with Ultra Rare and Secret Rare chances being 1:12 and 1:23; in some older historical sets, the latter two chances were 1:24 and 1:31 instead.
