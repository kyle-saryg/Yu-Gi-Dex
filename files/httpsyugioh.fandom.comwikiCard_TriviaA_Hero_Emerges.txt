 " Zombyra the Dark " appears in this card's artwork. This is fitting, as said monster is based on  Zombire . 
 This card's artwork is taken from  Yu-Gi-Oh!   Duel 022: " American Hero (Part 1) " ", appropriately the first panel seen from the Zombire comic book where he "emerges" to save the day. 
 The lore of this card's effect in both its release within  Dark Revelation Volume 2  and the International release of  Invasion of Chaos  incorrectly states that 'you', rather than 'your opponent', chooses the card randomly. 
 Each time this card was activated in the  anime , this card's effect succeeded in  Special Summoning  a monster. 
 Although this card has the word "Hero" in its name, it has no affiliation with the " HERO "  archetype .
 Ironically though,  Jaden Yuki , who runs an " Elemental HERO "  Deck , has used this card in the anime during some of his Duels, namely to Special Summon "Elemental HEROes" in a pinch.
