 Nurse Puppet's turn 
"Chimera" can turn the forest into wasteland, increasing "Chimera's" ATK by 50% ("Chimæra": 800 → 1200/150, "Dark Mammoth": 900 → 600/300). "Dark Mammoth" is destroyed instead (Yugi: 2000 → 1700  Life Points , but should be 1400).
 Yugi's turn 
Yugi summons " Dark Dragon " ( 1500 / 600 ).
 Nurse Puppet's turn 
Nurse Puppet summons " Zombie " ( 800 / 500 ) in  defense position .
 Several turns pass 
Some scenes of both players losing life points are shown (Yugi: 1015 → 950 → 800 Life Points, Nurse Puppet: 2000 → 1800 Life Points).
 Nurse Puppet's turn 
Nurse Puppet summons " Aphrodite " ( 300 / 500 ) in  attack position .
 Yugi's turn 
Yugi summons " Black Scorpion " ( 800 / 450 ) and attacks "Aphrodite", but Nurse Puppet combos "Aphrodite" with " Tsunami ", destroying "Black Scorpion". (In the real card game you can't activate normal spells during your opponent's turn. However, "Tsunami" is implied to be already on the field before this turn.)
 Nurse Puppet wins and takes " Neon Knight " as her prize.
 
 Yugi Mutou vs Ridley Sheldon 
 Ridley's turn 
Ridley summons " Neon Knight " ( 1800 / 1200 ) in the mountain in attack position.
 Yugi's turn 
Yugi summons " Devil Dragon " ( 1500 / 800 ) in the wasteland in defense position.
 Ridley's turn 
"Neon Knight" attacks and destroys "Devil Dragon".
 Yugi's turn 
Yugi summons " Death Wolf " ( 1200 / 1200 ) in the forest in attack position and " Shadowman " ( ??? / ??? ).
 Ridley's turn 
Ridley summons " King Beetle " ( 1400 / 1000 ) and attacks "Death Wolf" but "Shadowman" turns the entire field into darkness which increases "Death Wolf's" ATK (by how much is unknown, but it is enough to destroy Neon Knight). Since "Death Wolf's" ATK is higher, "Neon Knight" is destroyed.
 Yugi's turn 
"Death Wolf" attacks and destroys "King Beetle".
 Ridley's turn 
Ridley summons " Gargoyle " ( 1000 / 500 ) in the mountain.
 Yugi's turn 
Yugi summons " Night Soldier " ( ??? / ??? ). Yugi attacks "Gargoyle" with "Night Soldier", thinking "Night Soldier" will destroy "Gargoyle". However, "Gargoyle's" durability is raised by Sheldon's "doll field" and "Night Soldier" is destroyed instead. Yugi then activates an unnamed card, increasing "Death Wolf's" defense.
 Ridley's turn 
Ridley summons " Salamandra " ( 1000 / 900 ) to attack "Death Wolf", but Yugi has Death Wolf respond with a non-physical "howl" attack. "Salamandra" and "Gargoyle" are destroyed by "Death Wolf's" howl instead.
 Yugi wins.
