 Story 
 Anime 
 In order to protect  his younger brother , Kite used "Photon Transformation" to hunt " Numbers " as it negated the effects of the "Number" cards that amplified hidden desires. When a " Photon " card was played, Kite's body lit up with the power of " Galaxy-Eyes Photon Dragon ".
 
       Kite's Barian power.     
 When  Hart  transferred his remaining powers to Kite during  Vetrix 's ritual, his clothes were covered with a red aura, giving him the ability to  Xyz Summon  " Neo Galaxy-Eyes Photon Dragon ". [1] 
 
       Kaito using Photon Change in the manga     
 Photon Transformation's power cannot be used for long periods of time, which is one reason for Kite to finish his Duels quickly. [2]  It seems the more Kite uses this transformation, the more damage his body takes over time. [3]  As the  World Duel Carnival  finals began, Kite had reached his limit. Tests that were administered by  Orbital 7  revealed that if he continued the way he was going, he would die. [4] . As of the second season of  Yu-Gi-Oh! ZEXAL  the transformation no longer seems to have any effect on  Kite  as he no longer seems to be in pain when he uses it, though he neither carries as many "Number" cards, nor Duels as often as he had in the past as a Number Hunter.
 It would seem the damage Kite was taking was a backlash from resisting the Numbers' powers; as he was not consumed by their influence like most or had the protection of Astral and the Emperor's Key.
