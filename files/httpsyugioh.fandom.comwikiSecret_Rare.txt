 A  Secret Rare  (シークレットレア  Shīkuretto Rea , or simply  Secret [ citation needed ] ) card is identified by having a holographic rainbow card name and by the artwork having a unique holofoil known as parallel holofoil (named due to the parallel dot effect on the image). With the release of  Duelist Revolution , the parallel dot effect has become much sharper and the spacing has become smaller. On first edition printings and some collector tins the foil on the letters of Secret Rare cards sometimes "spill over", creating a thin film over the counter of the letters. This spill-over has also manifested in some Super Rare cards. 
 In sets that are older than  Tactical Evolution , Secret Rares are all either the first (#000) or last cards in a set. Since the  OCG Series 4 , there hasn't been a Secret Rare in OCG Booster Packs, until the release of  The New Challengers , which included Secret Rare versions of  Ultra Rares  from the set; in the TCG there has been always at least 2 Secret Rares per pack, and since  The Duelist Genesis , each pack has 8 Secrets, some of them  TCG exclusive  cards (like " Evolzar Dolkka "), some were cards original released on the OCG as promos (like " Metaion, the Timelord ") and others were cards whose rarity was increased (like in the case of " Rescue Rabbit ").
 Secret Rares were discontinued after the  Soul of the Duelist  packs due to excessive use of electronic  scales , however, they have been re-introduced in  Strike of Neos . The odds of getting a Secret Rare in a Booster Pack was 1:31 before the release of  The Shining Darkness , when the ratio changed to 1:23. The exceptions are the  Premium Pack ,  Premium Pack 2  and the  Hidden Arsenal  Booster Packs, since the set ratio for the Premium Packs is 2:1 for Secret Rares and 3:1 for  Super Rares , while in Hidden Arsenals, the set ratio for Secret Rares is 1:1 and for Super Rares is 4:1.
 Secret Rares are also the rarity of Collector Tin Promo cards, the Master Collection 1 and 2, and  several -SE packs (e.g.  EEN-ENSE ).
 In the  TCG , almost all Secret Rare cards use a diagonal foil pattern, with the exception of  Prismatic Secret Rare  cards. In the  OCG , almost all Secret Rare cards instead use a horizontal and vertical parallel foil pattern like the  TCG ' s Prismatic Secret Rare, except for those found in  Extra Pack  sets , which use the diagonal foil pattern.
