 " Mermail Abyssgaios " is featured in this card's artwork. Also, the wave he is summoning is similar to the head of " Poseidra, the Atlantean Dragon ". 
 This card's name is a portmanteau word of  Abyss  and  Maelstrom . 
 This is the only " Abyss- "  Spell / Trap Card  that does not  support  the " Mermail " archetype.
