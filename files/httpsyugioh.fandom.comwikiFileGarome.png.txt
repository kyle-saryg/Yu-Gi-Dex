 Biography 
 Piero is a slick loan shark who rips off the people he deals with by making them sign false documents, then taking their belongings. After  Carly Carmine  and  Jack Atlas  learn about Piero's shady dealings, Jack challenges Piero to a  Duel  to win back the illicit contracts and lift the debts, wagering " Red Dragon Archfiend " and the  Phoenix Whirlwind .
 Although Piero's cards flooded Jack's  field  with " Loan Tokens ", Jack was able to win and defeated Piero (nearly knocking the hairpiece from his head). After Piero's defeat, his men fled the scene with Piero, dropping the contracts and leaving them to be ripped apart by Jack, freeing everyone who was in Piero's debt. [2] 
 
 Deck 
 Don Piero plays a  Loan Deck  which focuses on  swarming  " Loan Tokens " to his opponent's side of the  field  and using them to inflict  damage .
