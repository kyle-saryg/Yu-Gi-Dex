 Mr. Stein , known in Japan as  Professor Kouji Satou  「佐藤浩二,  Satō Kōji 」, is a  Duel Academy  professor only seen in the third season, though flashbacks indicate he was present in the first year, seeing as  Chumley Huffington  appears in one of them. A former  Pro League  Duelist who came from a poverty-stricken family, Mr. Stein fosters a grudge towards  Jaden Yuki  for ruining the interest of other students in his lectures because of the boy's position as the academy's top  Duelist  despite having his horrendous grades. This sets an example for others that they don't need to study to succeed, causing most of them opting to sleep through his classes. His grudge increased when his one good student,  Alexis Rhodes , ditched his class, sending him over the edge. [2] 
 
       Mr. Stein in the  Pro League .     
 During his days as a pro Duelist, he was also studying to become a teacher so he didn't have much time to practice. He once Dueled  The D  but fell ill before being able to complete the match due to his extensive studying. It is revealed that when Stein could no longer Duel professionally, " Scar-Knight " "transformed into a bitter hardened version of himself", creating the separate " Scab Scarknight ". He tried to prevent Jaden from reaching  Thelonious Viper  in the lab where the monkey  Wheeler  was trained, but is defeated. Afterwards, when he attempts to pick up his precious "Scar-Knight" card, he seemingly falls to his death into the abyss. [1]  In the dub, he is characterized as a parody of  Ben Stein , particularly Stein's role in  Ferris Bueller's Day Off . He is noted as having a dull accent. In the Japanese version, Satou quotes  Uncle Ben Parker 's famous line "With great power comes great responsibility" from  Spider-Man .
 Later, Mr. Stein is seen when  Jim Crocodile Cook  uses the  Eye of Orichalcum  to look into Jaden's dark mind in a scene that was cut from the dub. [3] 
 Stein is seen one more time prior to Jaden's Duel with  Yubel , as Jaden remembers all the people Yubel has wronged. [4]

 Personality 
 Stein despises ignorance of any kind, as demonstrated by an analogy he uses: A piece of trash is on the ground, and two people pass it. The first sees it but does not pick it up, while the second does not see it, and while Jaden believes that the first is the worse person for intentionally leaving it there, Stein believes that the second is the worse person because the first  might  come back to pick it up, but the second  never  will, since he knows nothing of it. He despises Jaden in particular for having a negative impact towards other students, as his apathy towards actual schoolwork and talent in dueling has inspired other students to stop attending classes, believing that they don't need hard work to become great duelists themselves (while this is a valid complaint against Jaden, Stein's ideology is still rather lopsided since, as noted above, he views outright failing to notice a problem as worse than willfully ignoring it). He also hates Alexis since she stopped attending his class, which he viewed as a form of betrayal given that he had previously considered her an ideal student.
 In the dub, Stein's mannerisms are modeled after actor Ben Stein, as he speaks in a monotone that is comically boring during his lectures (though his lectures are still comically boring in the original version, since not even Bastion is able to sit through them). In both the dub and the Japanese version, Stein is polite even as he blames Jaden for ruining everything.
 
 Deck 
 Mr. Stein plays a  Scab Scarknight  Deck , which focuses on the abilities of the eponymous card (based on Unit 01 from  Neon Genesis Evangelion ) to gain  control  of his opponent's  monsters .
