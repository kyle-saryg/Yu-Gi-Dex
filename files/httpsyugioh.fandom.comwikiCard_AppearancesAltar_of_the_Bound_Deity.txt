 In  episode 45 ,  Roman Goodwin  uses this card during his Ground Duel against  Yusei Fudo . He activates this card after Yusei destroys " Underground Arachnid " through the effect of " Turbo Booster ". Roman then explains how he can use this card to Summon an  Earthbound Immortal . This made Yusei and  Akiza Izinski  extremely worried as  John  and  Mitch  were within the  geoglyph  and they could be sacrificed to Summon an Earthbound Immortal if they don't gain protection. In  the next episode , this card gained one  Earthbound Immortal Counter  on Roman's Standby Phase since Yusei controlled one Defense Position Monster. On Roman's next Standby Phase, this card gained one more Earthbound Immortal Counter since Yusei controlled one Defense Position Monster. Roman then activates " Offerings to the Bound Deity " to place two more Earthbound Immortal Counters on this card. This gave this card a total of four Earthbound Immortal Counters. Roman then sends this card to the Graveyard in order to Special Summon " Earthbound Immortal Uru " from his Deck. Before John and Mitch could be sacrificed,  Jack Atlas  comes in and gets to where the two boys are, sparing them from being sacrificed. 
 In  episode 56 , this card appears at the bottom of Roman's Deck before he inserts it into his Duel Disk.
