 History 
       The  Legendary Signer  facing Red Nova.     
 The Crimson Dragon and its five servants all fought the Crimson Devil, Red Nova. [1] 
 From the fires of a volcano, a male Signer appeared. He bore the full  Mark of the Dragon  on the left of his chest. He performed a miracle when he faced the Crimson Devil: The Signer took the Crimson Dragon's power, through  Blazing Soul  and used it to fight the Devil, defeating it and sealing it. [1]
