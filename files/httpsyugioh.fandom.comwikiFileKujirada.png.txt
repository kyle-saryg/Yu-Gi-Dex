 Biography 
 Kujirada's Digital Pet is a Hidden Character. It lived for two months while other pets only live for twenty-one days. The monster, who kept waking his master for food and grew tired of eating digital pet food only, commands Kujirada to link up with other people's devices so the monster can eat other people's digital pets.  Katsuya Jonouchi 's  pet , and  Anzu Mazaki 's pet,  Peachy  are eaten.  Yugi's  pet,  U2 , fights back and destroys Kujirada's monster. Though somewhat disappointed at the loss of his prized monster, he was happy to finally be able to get some decent sleep.
