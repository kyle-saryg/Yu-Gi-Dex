 The  Rare Hunters , known as  Ghouls  in the Japanese version and  Jackals  in some video games, is an underground cult of rogue duelists, card thieves, bootleggers, cheaters, con artists, and liars in the  Yu-Gi-Oh!   manga  and  anime , and  Yu-Gi-Oh! GX  anime series. They acted as the main antagonists of the  Battle City  arc of  Yu-Gi-Oh! . In the manga and Japanese anime, the Ghouls are the main group, and the Rare Hunters is the combat section of the Ghouls.

 History 
 Origins 
 The Rare Hunters were formed by  Marik Ishtar  to collect the  Egyptian God Cards  and other cards of value. It is not specified exactly when they were formed, but it was some time after Marik murdered his father and left with Odion the following day. The Rare Hunters are known to be Marik's underlings and assist him in his goals with  Odion  being the second in command.
 They are known to have stolen two of the three  Egyptian Gods , but failed to steal  Obelisk the Tormentor  thanks to the intervention of  Ishizu Ishtar . Also, they designed counterfeit copies of rare cards, including  The Winged Dragon of Ra  and the five pieces of  Exodia .
 
 Battle City 
 The first Rare Hunter to appear (although not addressed as one) was  Bandit Keith , who stole the  Millennium Puzzle  from  Yugi Muto . Yugi won the Puzzle back, but not before meeting Marik through his mind control of Keith, who warned Yugi he will return. In this Duel the methods of the Rare Hunters was also set: nearly all of the Rare Hunters cheat in their duels.
 When  Seto Kaiba  organized the Battle City Tournament (which he did to lure out the Rare Hunters who had the other two Egyptian God Cards), Marik ordered his minions to go to the tournament and defeat the Duelists there, hoping to seize many rare cards that the world's best duelists would surely have. The Rare Hunters hacked into Battle City's computer system and registered themselves in the tournament. However, upon discovering his sister  Ishizu Ishtar  gave the final God card to Kaiba, Marik traveled to Battle City himself to take the card back. Yugi was also in the tournament, giving Marik the perfect opportunity to take both the Millennium Puzzle and the final God card.
 As he traveled to Domino, Marik had several other Rare Hunters attempt to defeat Yugi, but they failed and ended up having their minds banished to the  Shadow Realm  as punishment for their failure to defeat Yugi. Marik was desperate enough to duel Yugi himself by controlling  Strings  using his God card, " Slifer the Sky Dragon ". When Yugi prevailed again and acquired "Slifer", Marik attempted to have two Rare Hunters named  Lumis and Umbra  defeat him and Kaiba in a  Tag-Team Duel . This failed as well. As Kaiba and Yugi had enough Locator Cards to enter the finals, Marik brainwashed Joey into a near flawlessly constructed death duel with Yugi. Once this failed, Marik decided there was nothing else to do but face the two himself, and he and Odion entered the finals.
 
 Aftermath 
 After this, the fate of the Rare Hunters was not known, though the video game  Yu-Gi-Oh! Reshef of Destruction , which is an alternate-universe game set in the aftermath of Battle City, portrays them as still seeking the God cards with Bandit Keith as their new leader. Since Marik and Odion returned their loyalty to the Pharaoh during the tournament after Yami Marik took over his body, they are assumed to have left the Rare Hunters after the finale, thus leaving the group without a leader or second-in-command. This can be evidenced since after taking back control of his body from Yami Marik, he surrendered his Duel with the Pharaoh to  willingly  give him the last Egyptian God and rarest Duel Monsters card (Ra), along with Odion only following Marik's "wrong" orders at the time since he was the only person who could protect Marik from his darker half emerging and possessing him. So it is unknown if the rest of the Rare Hunters either broke up or chose a different leader.
 
 GX 
 While  Pegasus  is explaining to Jaden how God cards can be dangerous during  episode 85 , a flashback features some Rare Hunters who have been punished by  The Winged Dragon of Ra  from  episode 88  of the original series.
 The Rare Hunters are shown as a part of  Chazz 's darkness in his heart, after he lost to  Trueman  and being sent to the  World of Darkness . During his illusions of failing in his career as a pro and quitting it, Chazz suddenly finds himself on the street, and is challenged to an  Ante Duel  by a gang of Rare Hunters.

 Trivia 
 In the manga, before the  Tournament Finals , each Rare Hunter lost to Yugi in a different way (excluding  Mask of Light  and  Mask of Darkness ):  the first Rare Hunter  surrendered,  Pandora  lost all of his Life Points,  Marik  controlling  Doll  lost through a  Deck out , and Marik controlling  Jonouchi  lost by default (as Marik was technically was Dueling, and he couldn't control Jonouchi anymore). 
 In some mythology, ghouls were said to kill wounded soldiers and loot their corpses. The Ghouls organization named themselves after these creatures because they steal from defeated Duelists. 
 In the English dub, the Rare Hunters are not counterfeiters and are never explicitly stated to be thieves (although the latter is heavily implied). It is only stated that they acquire cards through ante rules. The only counterfeit card shown in the ghouls' possession is the counterfeit " The Winged Dragon of Ra ".
