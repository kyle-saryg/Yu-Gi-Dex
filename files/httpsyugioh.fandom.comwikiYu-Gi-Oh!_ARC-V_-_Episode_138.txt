 Featured Duel: Gong Strong and Jack Atlas vs. Z-ARC 
 Duel continues from the previous episode . 
 Z-ARC  has 6000  LP  and  controls  " Supreme King Z-ARC " (4000/4000) and two copies of " Supreme King Dragon Darkwurm " (1800/1200). He also has " Supreme King Gate Zero " (   0) and " Supreme King Gate Infinity " (   13) in his  Pendulum Zones , and 2 cards in his hand.  Gong Strong  and  Jack Atlas  both have 5 cards in their hand and 2000 LP. " Crossover " is active on the field.
 Turn 8: Jack 
 Jack  draws " Dark Resonator ". As Jack controls no monsters, he  Special Summons  " Red Gargoyle " (1200/1400) from his hand via its own effect. He then  Normal Summons  " Red Resonator " (600/200). Jack  activates  the effect of "Gargoyle", allowing him to double the Level of a monster he controls. He doubles the Level of "Resonator". Jack  tunes  the Level 4 "Gargoyle" with the Level 4  Tuner monster  "Red Resonator" to  Synchro Summon  " Scarlight Red Dragon Archfiend " (3000/2000) in  Attack Position . As his opponent Synchro Summoned while  Z-ARC  controls "Z-ARC", he activates the effect of " Supreme King Dragon Clear Wing " in his Extra Deck, Tributing two " Supreme King Dragon " monsters he controls to Synchro Summon it in Attack Position (2500/2000).
 As "Clear Wing" was Synchro Summoned, Z-ARC activates its effect,  negating  the effects of all monsters his opponent controls, and destroying them. Jack  activates  the effect of " Brutal Red " in his hand, sending it to the  Graveyard  as a " Red " monster would be destroyed. This turn, it cannot be destroyed and it gains 1000 ATK. Jack targets "Scarlight" (3000 → 4000). "Scarlight" attacks "Clear Wing". As "Clear Wing" is  battling , Z-ARC activates its effect to negate the attack,  destroy  the opponent's batting monster, and inflict damage to Jack equal to the ATK of the destroyed monster. "Scarlight" is not destroyed due to the effect of "Brutal Red". Jack  Sets  a card.
 Turn 9: Gong 
Gong Normal Summons " Superheavy Samurai Battleball " (100/800). He Special Summons " Superheavy Samurai Hexagon " (600/???) from his hand by its effect. Gong tunes the Level 6 "Hexagon" with the Level 2 Tuner monster "Battleball" to Synchro Summon " Superheavy Samurai Swordsmith " (0/2400) in  Defense Position . As "Swordsmith" was Special Summoned, Gong activates its effect to Special Summon as many " Superheavy Samurai " monster from his hand as possible. Gong Special Summons " Superheavy Samurai Blue Brawler " (0/2000), " Superheavy Samurai Swordsman " (1000/1800), and " Superheavy Samurai Big Benkei " (1000/3500), all in Defense Position.
 Turn 10: Z-ARC 
Z-ARC  equips  "Clear Wing" with " Supreme Presence ". While active, "Supreme Presence" allows Z-ARC to change an effect that targets only one of his opponent's monsters to affect all monsters his opponents control instead. "Clear Wing" attacks "Benkei", with Z-ARC activating the former's effect to destroy "Benkei" and inflict its ATK as damage. The effect of "Supreme Presence" allows the effect of "Clear Wing" to affect all opposing monsters instead. As an effect would destroy cards on the field, Gong activates the effect of " Superheavy Samurai Ward Chief Heavystrong " in his hand by Tributing a "Superheavy Samurai" monster he controls to Special Summon it from his hand. Gong Tributes "Swordsman" to Special Summon "Heavystrong" (1000/3000) in Defense Position. As "Heavystrong" was Special Summoned by its own effect, the  Battle Phase  ends. Gong activates the effect of "Heavystrong", allowing him to prevent two monsters he controls from being destroyed while it is face-up on the field until the end of the turn. He targets "Heavystrong" and "Scarlight". The effect of "Clear Wing" continues and "Benkei", "Blue Brawler", and "Swordsmith" are destroyed. The sum of their ATK is 1000 (Gong / Jack: 2000 → 1000 LP).
 Turn 11: Jack 
Jack activates the  Trap Card  " Vision Synchro ", allowing him to Synchro Summon a monster using monsters from his hand, but the Summoned monster will return to the Extra Deck during the End Phase. Jack  double tunes  the Level 4 " Red Sprinter " with the Level 3 Tuner monsters "Dark Resonator" and " Net Resonator " from his hand to Synchro Summon " Tyrant Red Dragon Archfiend " in Attack Position (3500/3000). As "Net Resonator" was used for a Synchro Summon, its effect prevents Jack from taking  effect damage  while he controls the Summoned monster. Gong activates the effect of "Heavystrong" to prevent "Scarlight" and "Tyrant" from being destroyed this turn.
 "Scarlight" attacks "Clear Wing", but Z-ARC activates the effect of "Clear Wing" to try to negate the attack, destroy "Scarlight", and inflict its ATK as damage. "Scarlight" is not destroyed, due to the effect of "Heavystrong". The effect of "Supreme Presence" makes the effect of "Clear Wing" affect all opposing monsters instead. "Heavystrong" is destroyed. (Gong: 1000 → 0 LP).
 "Tyrant" attacks "Clear Wing" and destroys it. The Pendulum Effect of "Supreme King Gate Zero" prevents Z-ARC from taking damage, while the Pendulum Effect of "Supreme King Gate Infinity" increases his LP by the damage he would have taken (Z-ARC: 6000 → 7000 LP).
 Due to the effect of "Vision Synchro", "Tyrant" returns to Jack's Extra Deck during his End Phase.
 Turn 12: Z-ARC 
At this point,  Sylvio Sawatari  and  Crow Hogan  join the Duel, taking the intrusion penalty (Sylvio / Crow: 4000 → 2000 LP)
 "Z-ARC" attacks and destroys "Scarlight". (Jack: 1000 → 0 LP).
 Duel continues in the next episode . 
 
 
 Differences in Adaptation 
 In the dub, throughout Z-ARC's Duel against Jack and Gong, background music from  Yu-Gi-Oh! 5D's  is being played whenever it it Jack's turn. 
 The dub also implies that Jack was unaware of the effects of "Supreme King Gate Zero" and "Supreme King Gate Infinity" by having Z-ARC point out the fact that he did not witness that part of the Duel. This would cause a plot hole in the next episode in which  Leo Akaba  somehow knew that there were two  Fusion Monsters  in the  Graveyard  despite not being there himself.
