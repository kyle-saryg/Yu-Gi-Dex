 " Journey to the Duelist Kingdom " 
 " The Ultimate Great Moth " 
 
 
 
 
 "Into the Hornet's Nest" , known as  "Insector Combo"  in the Japanese version, is the fourth episode of the  Yu-Gi-Oh!  second series anime . It first aired in Japan on May 9, 2000 and in the United States on October 20, 2001.
 As the ferry to  Duelist Kingdom  arrives,  Yugi 's first opponent is  Weevil , as revenge for destroying his  Exodia  cards. However, Weevil, a sneaky cheater, tricks Yugi into dueling in an arena where all his  Insect  cards get a power boost, pushing Yugi to his limit.
 When this episode first aired in the United States on  Kids WB! , it was merged with the following episode, so the Duel took place in just one episode titled " The Ultimate Great Moth ". The two separate episodes were dubbed, but were only seen in other countries and on DVD and VHS until  4Kids TV  aired episode 5 on November 25, 2006.

 Summary 
 Featured Duel: Yami Yugi vs. Weevil Underwood 
 
 This Duel uses  Duelist Kingdom  gameplay. Rules and  card effects  may differ from that of the  TCG / OCG . See the individual card articles for more information.     
 Monsters  compatible with  Forest (terrain)  or  Desert  receive a 30%  Field Power Bonus . This includes  Beast ,  Beast-Warrior ,  Dinosaur ,  Insect ,  Plant ,  Rock  and  Zombie - Type  monsters.
 Turn 1: Weevil 
Weevil  draws . He then  Normal Summons  " Killer Needle " (1200 → 1560/1000 → 1300) in  Attack Position .
 Turn 2: Yami Yugi 
Yugi draws. He then Normal Summons " Mammoth Graveyard " (1200 → 1560/800 → 1040) in Attack Position. "Mammoth Graveyard"  attacks  "Killer Needle",  destroying  both monsters in a  Double KO .
 Turn 3: Weevil 
Weevil draws. He then Normal Summons " Hercules Beetle " (1500 → 1950/2000 → 2600) in Attack Position.
 Turn 4: Yami Yugi 
Yugi draws. He then Normal Summons " Feral Imp " (1300/1400) in Attack Position. Yugi then  activates  " Horn of the Unicorn ", equipping it to "Feral Imp" and increasing its  ATK  and  DEF  by 700 ("Feral Imp": 1300 → 2000/1400 → 2100). "Feral Imp" attacks "Hercules Beetle". Because "Hercules Beetle" has a Field Power Bonus and it is battling a monster that has an Equip Card, the effects of "Horn of the Unicorn" are negated ("Feral Imp": 2000 → 1300/2100 → 1400). "Hercules Beetle" destroys "Feral Imp" (Yugi: 2000 → 1350  LP ).
 Turn 5: Weevil 
Weevil passes.
 Turn 6: Yami Yugi 
Yugi draws. He then  Sets  a monster.
 Turn 7: Weevil 
Weevil draws. He then Normal Summons " Basic Insect " (500 → 650/700 → 910) in Attack Position. Weevil then activates " Level 3 Laser Cannon ", equipping it to "Basic Insect" and increasing its ATK and DEF by 300 ("Basic Insect": 650 → 950/910 → 1210). He then activates " Lev. 2 Power Boost ", equipping it to "Basic Insect" and increasing its ATK by 1200 and its DEF by 200 ("Basic Insect": 950 → 2150/1210 → 1410). "Basic Insect" attacks and destroys Yugi's Set " Griffore " (1200 → 1560/1500 → 1950).

Yugi draws " Dark Magician " and subsequently Sets it.
 Turn 17: Weevil 
Weevil draws. "Basic Insect" attacks Yugi's Set "Dark Magician" (2500/2100). Yugi then activates his face-down " Mirror Force " to destroy every monster on Weevil's side of the field and inflict damage to him equal to the difference between the ATK of "Basic Insect" and the ATK of all other monsters destroyed by this effect. Weevil tries to stop the attack but Yugi got the better of him (Weevil: 2000 → 555 LP).
 Duel continues in the next episode . 
 
 Notes 
 During the last step of this episode,  Yami  activates "Mirror Force" to reflect  Weevil 's "Basic Insect" attack right back to his monsters. Weevil's  Life Points  drop from 2000 to 555, for a net decrease of  1445  .
 In the anime, "Mirror Force" has the ability to inflict  Battle Damage  to an opponent based on the difference between the  ATK  power of the reflected attack (in this case, Basic Insect's i.e. 2150) and the ATK of each of the destroyed monsters. In this episode however, applying this rule with the exact calculations would have made Weevil lose the Duel immediately, as explained by the table below:

 SURPLUS

 The total damage Weevil should have been dealt equals  2035 . Yet the damage only amounted to  1445 , a surplus difference of  590 . One possibility is that the writers ignored the damage from either "Big Insect" or "Gokibore", in order to allow the Duel to continue.
 
 Differences from the TCG 
 The Duels in this episode followed the earlier  Duel Monsters  rules, so 2000  Life Points  were used as opposed to 8000,  Tributes  were not required for  Level  5 or higher  monsters  and players could not attack each other  directly .
 Differences in individual cards included:
 
 Changes to the English dub 
 In the Japanese version, when Weevil challenges Yugi to a duel Yugi accepts, the Millennium Puzzle flashes and Yami appears. In the Dub the whole transformation sequence is added. 
 In the Japanese version, Weevil was granted sole knowledge of the Duelist Kingdom's rules because he won the Regionals. In the English version, Weevil stole the rulebook. 
 The Japanese version of the episode ends with Yugi's successful move. The dub version ends with Weevil gloating. 
 In the Japanese version, Joey refers to Tea and Tristan as "funny sidekicks" when some other duelists pass by to see Weevil and Yugi's duel. In the dub, he calls them "trespassers." 
 In the Japanese version, Yugi refers to the duel between him and Weevil as a "live or die match" as he is betting his card deck, which is referred to as his "life as a duelist." This is interesting as in the manga, Yugi bets his only star chip and "his life" against Weevil's two star chips with the implication that if Weevil wins, Yugi will commit suicide and Weevil will get his deck. All references or words implying dying are omitted from the dub and Yugi simply bets his only star chip and his grandfather's deck. 
 The artwork of the card "LV2 Power Boost" was changed. 
 The words "TO BE CONTINUED" are added at the end of the dub episode. 
 Mistakes 
 In the dub, " Saggi the Dark Clown " is shown instead of " Kamakiriman ". 
 In the English dub, " Hercules Beetle " is shown to have 1200 Attack Points on its card when Weevil holds it up. However, when its Attack Points are shown by the counter, they are then correctly displayed as 1500. This may be due to the fact that it could have been edited directly from " Killer Needle ", which  actually has  1200 Attack Points. 
 In both versions, Weevil had four cards in his hand after he Normal Summoned "Kamakiriman", when he should only have three at the moment since he just played a card from his hand, and he still had four cards in his hand before he attacked. 
 This episode contradicts itself: when " Feral Imp " equipped with " Horn of the Unicorn " attacked, it was destroyed by "Hercules Beetle" due to the Field Power Bonus rules negating "Horn of the Unicorn". In that case, Yugi's " Griffore " should've survived the attack that Weevil's " Basic Insect " launched, as the former got a Field Power Bonus while the latter had both the Field Bonus AND two  Equip Cards  on it. So by those rules and the above example, the boost from the two Equip Cards attached to "Basic Insect" should've been negated, as "Griffore" gained a Field Power Bonus, meaning that "Griffore" should've survived the attack and reflected the difference back as damage, as "Griffore's" Defense was much higher than "Basic Insect's" Attack with or without the Field Power Bonus.
