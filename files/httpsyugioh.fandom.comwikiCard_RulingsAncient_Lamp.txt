 OCG Rulings 
 Damage inflicted by " Armory Arm " is inflicted to the opponent of the controller of " Armory Arm ".  When the equipped monster attacks and destroys your own monster because of " Ancient Lamp ", then " Armory Arm " will still inflict damage to your opponent. [1] 
 When this card is flipped face-up by an opponent's attack, the effect activates (and starts a  Chain ). [2] 
 You can only Special Summon a " La Jinn the Mystical Genie of the Lamp " from your hand. [2] 
 The effect which Special Summons " La Jinn the Mystical Genie of the Lamp " is an  Ignition Effect  which can only be activated during your Main Phase, and can only be used by the controller of " Ancient Lamp " [3] 
 If " Drillroid " attacks a face-down " Ancient Lamp ", then the effect of " Drillroid " activates as the first link in the Chain, and then the effect of " Ancient Lamp " activates.  Resolving backwards, you first resolve the effect of " Ancient Lamp ".  The effect of " Ancient Lamp " makes you perform  damage calculation , so the effect of " Drillroid " cannot destroy " Ancient Lamp ". [4] 
 Previously Official Rulings 
   These TCG rulings were issued by  Upper Deck Entertainment  and have since been deemed unofficial by Konami. [5]  They were previously considered official and can still be correct, as long as they follow the official gameplay rules, or unless Konami has issued a ruling that says otherwise.

 Neo-Spacian Glow Moss : If a monster attacks a face-down " Ancient Lamp ", and " Ancient Lamp " re-directs the  attack  to " Neo-Spacian Glow Moss ", the effect of " Neo-Spacian Glow Moss " will not activate, because the effect of " Ancient Lamp " causes it to  miss the timing . 
 Shield Warrior : If a monster you control is forced to battle another  monster  you control by the effect of your opponent's " Ancient Lamp ", when you activate " Shield Warrior 's" effect during  damage calculation , both of your monsters are not  destroyed .
