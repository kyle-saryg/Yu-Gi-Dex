 Description 
 A skilled Duelist who finished second in the Regionals, Rex Raptor's strategy focuses on having his  Dinosaurs  stomp all over his foes with an aggressive offense. His prized possession is the rare " Red-Eyes B. Dragon ," which he spent his lifetime to obtain.
 
 Biography 
 After the player advances to Stage 20, they will encounter Rex for the first time, who will be taunting  Josh  in the middle of their Duel. Shortly afterwards, Rex defeats Josh with an attack from his " Two-Headed King Rex ", before proceeding to tell the player that his "prehistoric pals are not to be messed with," and that his monsters will lead him to the top of the "kingdom."
 Until the player defeats Rex for the first time, whenever they challenge Rex to a Duel, he will be mildly surprised and rhetorically ask the player if they want to Duel against his dinosaurs. He goes on to admit that he's impressed by the player's guts in challenging him, but also warns the player that his "prehistoric predators" are "ginormously powerful." Rex then prompts the player to Duel, before declaring, "My Duelin' dinos will tear you to shreds!"
 Upon Rex's first defeat, he briefly expresses surprise, before attempting to save face by claiming that he only lost because he went easy on the player, despite admitting he had said that he wouldn't. After an awkward pause, Rex swears that he won't let the player win the next time, saying that his dinos won't go extinct again and that the player can't fossilize them forever.
 After the player redeems their final unclaimed reward for Rex Raptor's Character Unlock Missions, they will encounter Rex again, who brags that he finished second place in the Regionals with his skills - specifically, skills that he'll now use to defeat the player. He then warns the player that if they think of him as a one-trick pony with his dinosaurs, they're making a big mistake, as Rex immediately reveals his " Red-Eyes B. Dragon " card to the player. He chuckles, and claims that he sees the player quaking in their boots. Rex then admits that although "Red-Eyes B. Dragon" isn't a  dinosaur , it's as strong as any of them, and that it will stomp the player flat, before he bursts into laughter.

 Trivia 
 Though Rex's signature cards are centralized around Dinosaurs, his strongest monsters (that feature a cut-in frame of himself) tend to be Dragon-Types, such as the " Red-Eyes B. Dragon " and " Tyrant Dragon ". 
 Scud , Rex Raptor,  Téa Gardner (DM) ,  Mako Tsunami , and  Odion , in ascending order, are the characters with the least card-specific dialogue in-game. 
 Yugi Muto (DM) , Mako Tsunami, Rex Raptor,  Bandit Keith ,  Ishizu Ishtar , Odion,  Maximillion Pegasus ,  Arkana ,  Espa Roba , Scud,  Prana ,  Dr. Vellian Crowler ,  Syrus Truesdale , and  Sartorius Kumar  are the characters with the least character-specific dialogue in-game.
 The aforementioned characters, excluding Prana, have the average amount of character-specific dialogue a Legendary Duelist possesses.

 Yami Yugi, Arkana,  Yubel ,  Dark Signer Kalin Kessler ,  Dark Signer Carly Carmine ,  Rex Goodwin  - Power of Dark 
 Seto Kaiba (DM)  - Peak Performance 
 Joey Wheeler (DM),  Tristan Taylor (DM)  - Fields of the Warriors

 Mako Tsunami - Mythic Depths 
 Bonz  - Straight to the Grave 
 Chazz Princeton - Land of the Ojamas 
 Sartorius Kumar - Light Barrier 
 Jaden Yuki,  Jaden/Yubel  - Neo Space! 
 There are some Legendary Duelists who share the same signature card, and 3D cutscene for the said card:
 Yami Yugi, Yugi Muto (DM),  Yugi Muto (DSOD)  -  Dark Magician  (including its  Dark Side of Dimensions  counterpart) 
 Yami Yugi, Téa Gardner (DM), Yugi Muto (DSOD),  Téa Gardner (DSOD)  -  Dark Magician Girl  (including its  Dark Side of Dimensions  counterpart)

 Jaden Yuki, Jaden/Yubel -  Elemental HERO Neos ,  Elemental HERO Flame Wingman 
 Yubel, Jaden/Yubel -  Yubel 
 The 3D animation cutscene for the  Dark Side of Dimensions  counterpart of "Red-Eyes B. Dragon" being unavailable for Rex is most likely due to him not being featured in the film,  Yu-Gi-Oh! The Dark Side of Dimensions . 
 While Legendary Duelists have their own theme music when a player Duels against them, some share the same theme music:
 Joey Wheeler (DM), Mai Valentine, and Tristan Taylor (DM) 
 Téa Gardner (DM) and Yugi Muto (DM) 
 Weevil Underwood , Rex Raptor, Bandit Keith, and Bonz
