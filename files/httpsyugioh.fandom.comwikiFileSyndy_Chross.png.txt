 Biography 
 During the opening of the  Duel Team Carnival , someone hacked the  Obots , causing a huge riot. The members of  Team ZEXAL  found the building where the hacker was and went after him. [1]  After defeating  Fusion Mask , the guardian of the first Web Point [2] , they reached the top of the building, where they found Syndy, the guardian of the second Web Point, holding  Shark 's friends as hostages, suspended by ropes. Syndy and Shark then  Dueled , with the rule that each 1000  Life Points  Shark lost would make one of the 4 ropes holding his friends be severed. Syndy managed to reduce Shark's Life Points to 300 using her quick  Synchro Summons , but was ultimately defeated by Shark's " Number C101: Silent Honor DARK ". Upon Syndy's loss,  Master Evil  appeared, disappointed that Syndy failed him; she begged him not to punish her, but the ground under her elevated and formed a kind of rocket, and Evil sent her flying away. [3]
