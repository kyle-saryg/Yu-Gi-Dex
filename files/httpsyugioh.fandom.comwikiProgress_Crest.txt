Progress Crests  (also known as " Movement Crests ") are used to  move  your monsters through the  Dungeon  in the game of  Dungeon Dice Monsters .
 Under normal conditions, a player needs to spend 1 Movement Crest per space from his/her  Crest Pool  to move 1 of his/her monsters in play. However,  Flying  Monsters require 2 Crests per space to move.
 The player doesn't need to pay any Movement Crests when 1 of his/her monster is moved through the Dungeon by the effect of a monster or an item.
