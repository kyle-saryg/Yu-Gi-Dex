 Limited Edition  is an  edition  of cards in the  TCG , Korean  OCG , and Asian-English  OCG  that is marked by the text "Limited Edition". It is not used in the Japanese, Japanese-Asian, and Chinese  OCG .
 Limited Edition is placed on many promotional cards, including  Sneak Peek Participation Cards ,  Shonen Jump Championship Series Prize Cards  and  Yu-Gi-Oh! Championship Series Prize Cards ,  Collector Tin promotional cards  (except  2003 Collector's Tins ), and magazine promotional cards such as the  Shonen Jump promotional cards . Some retail sets, such as the original  Hidden Arsenal  and  TCG   Gold Series  sets (other than  Premium Gold  sets) are entirely Limited Edition; after their first run, these sets may be later printed as  Unlimited Edition .
 On 1st Edition and Limited Edition cards, the  Eye of Anubis Hologram  is gold; on Unlimited Edition cards, it is silver. 1st Edition cards also seem to have a darker print coloring than their Unlimited Edition cards.
 For  Series 3  to  8  cards, the edition text (such as the text "Limited Edition") is located under the left side of the card's artwork. From  Series 9  onward, for cards without  limitation text , the edition text is located to the right of the  passcode  (leaving a space for the passcode even if the card has none); for cards with limitation text other than  Pendulum Monsters , the edition text is located in its previous position (Pendulum Monsters with limitation text do not have edition text).
