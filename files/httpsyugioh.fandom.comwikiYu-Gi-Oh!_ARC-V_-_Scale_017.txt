 Summary 
   This summary is currently incomplete. 
 As  Shingo  and  Shun  find  Yuzu  upon their arrival to  Yuya 's hideout,  Yuri  uses his summoned " Starving Venemy Dragon " to attack  Reiji 's " D/D/D Supersight King Zero Maxwell ". But Reiji uses a trap to prevent his monster from being destroyed by it and  Yuto 's " Dark Anthelion Dragon " while taking damage. After Yuya tags himself back in, he tells Reiji how on the day of World Illusion, he found himself in an escape pod and sees his father  Yusho  working frantically while revealing that he took  Genesis Omega Dragon  from Reiji's father  Leo  as he became obsessed with it. While they assumed the card's power to be otherworldly, Yusho learned it was man-made.
 Though Yuya explains that his father sent him to this time to find the G.O.D.'s creator and learn its true nature, Reiji refuses to listen any further while sacrificing Zero Maxwell to summon " D/D/D Destiny King Zero Laplace " as it destroys Starving Venemy and Dark Anthelion.
 Though the effect Reiji's " D/D Scale Surveyor " disabled his ability to  Pendulum Summon  as he placed Yuto and Yuri's dragons on his Pendulum zones, a smiling Yuya decides to use Overscale Pendulum. As the duel occurs,  Eve  and  Ren  observe Yuya and Reiji from afar.
 
 Featured Duel: Yuya Sakaki/Yuto/Yuri vs. Reiji Akaba 
 Duel continues from the previous Scale . 
 Turn 5: Yuri 
 Yuri   activates  the  effect  of " Starving Venemy Dragon ",  negating  the effects of  Reiji 's " D/D/D Supersight King Zero Maxwell " and granting those effects to "Starving Venemy". Furthermore, the  ATK  of "Zero Maxell" is reduced by 500 ("Zero Maxwell": 2800 → 2300 ATK) and Reiji takes 500  damage  (Reiji: 4000 → 3500 LP). Yuri switches " Dark Anthelion Dragon " to  Attack Position . "Starving Venemy"  attacks  "Zero Maxwell". Reiji activates his  face-down  " Dimension Drape ", preventing the  destruction  of "Zero Maxwell" this  turn , however he still takes  battle damage  (Reiji: 3500 → 3300 LP). Next, "Dark Anthelion" attacks "Zero Maxwell" as well, with the same result (Reiji: 3300 → 2600 LP). Yuri  Sets  1 card.
 At this point, Yuri switches back to  Yuya .
 Turn 6: Reiji 
Reiji activates " Creative Destruction ", destroying "Zero Maxwell" and  adding  another " D/D/D "  monster  to his  hand , as well as reducing the  DEF  of "Starving Venemy" to zero ("Starving Venemy": 2000 → 0 DEF). He then uses his set Pendulum Scales to  Pendulum Summon  "Zero Maxwell" (2800/2500) back from his  Extra Deck , and proceeds to  release  it,  Special Summoning  " D/D/D Destiny King Zero Laplace " (0/0) from his hand. Yuya activates his face-down " Trick Barrier ", making it so that Reiji can only attack "Starving Venemy". Reiji activates the  Continuous Spell Card  " Endless Seal ", allowing him to recover " Block Attack " from his  Graveyard  since he has Pendulum Summoned a "D/D/D" monster this turn. He then activates it, switching "Starving Venemy" to  Defense Position . "Zero Laplace" attacks "Starving Venemy", with its effects activating, making its ATK double the attack of "Starving Venemy" ("Zero Laplace": 0 → 5000 ATK) and inflicting  piercing  battle damage. "Starving Venemy" is destroyed, however, since it had gained the effects of "Zero Maxwell", the damage to Yuya is reduced to zero. Upon the destruction of "Starving Venemy", Yuya places it ( PS : 1) in his right  Pendulum Zone . Also, the effect of "Trick Barrier" allows him to  draw  1 card. Since he has just attacked a 0-DEF monster, Reiji activates the effect of " 00 Rush ", allowing "Zero Laplace" to attack again. "Zero Laplace" attacks "Dark Anthelion", with its effect activating ("Zero Laplace": 0 → 6000 ATK). "Dark Anthelion" is destroyed, but Yuya activates the  Pendulum Effect  of "Starving Venemy", reducing the damage to zero. Upon the destruction of "Dark Anthelion", Yuya places it (PS: 10) in his left Pendulum Zone.
 Turn 7: Yuya 
Reiji activates the Pendulum Effect of " D/D Scale Surveyor ", setting the  Pendulum Scales  of "Starving Venemy" and "Dark Anthelion" to zero.
 Duel continues in the next Scale .
