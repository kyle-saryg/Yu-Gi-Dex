The  D-Network  (Ｄネットワーク,  Dyueru Nettowāku ) or  D-Net  (Ｄネット,  Dī Netto ) is a system used in the  Yu-Gi-Oh! D Team ZEXAL  manga. It is a network used by  Dueling Teams  through their  D-Pads , where they can send  Duel  invitations to each other, among other things. [1]  When a person officially becomes member of a team by receiving their team's badge, they can access the D-Network. [2]  Also, in the  Team Duel Tournament , one could check the tournament's rules' details anytime by consulting the D-Network. [3]
