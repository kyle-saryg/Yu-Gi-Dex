 In  episode 44 ,  Amnael  uses this card during his duel against  Alexis Rhodes . After Amanel uses an unknown Spell to destroy " Cyber Blader ", he uses this card and " Alchemy Beast - Ouroboros the Bronze " to attack directly, defeating Alexis. 
 In  episode 45 , Amnael uses this card during his duel against  Jaden Yuki . He summons this card via " Steel Lamp ". Later " Elemental HERO Bubbleman " (whose ATK was 1600 due to it being equipped with " Bubble Blaster ") attacks this card, but Amnael activates " Elemental Absorber " and banishes " Aqua Spirit " from his hand in order to nullify the attack. On Amnael's next turn, this card, " Alchemy Beast - Ouroboros the Bronze " and " Alchemy Beast - Leon the Lead " attack directly via their own effects. Amnael then activates " Black Process - Negledo " to banish this card, "Ouroboros the Bronze" and "Leon the Lead" from the field and draw six cards (two for each  Alchemy Beast  banished). In  the next episode , this card is shown when Amnael counts up the number of banished monsters for the effect of " Helios Duo Megistus ". After Jaden summons " Elemental HERO Electrum ", the latter's effect returns all banished monsters to their owners' Decks. 
 Its attack is called  Armed Flames  in the original, while in the dub, it's called  Streamshot of Ore .
