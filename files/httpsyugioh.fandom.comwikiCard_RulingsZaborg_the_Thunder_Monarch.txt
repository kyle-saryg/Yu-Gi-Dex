 OCG Rulings 
 If " Zaborg the Thunder Monarch " is Tribute Summoned by the effect of " Ultimate Offering " in the middle of a chain, then you will still activate " Zaborg the Thunder Monarch "'s effect.  This is because the effect is not optional and you cannot " miss the timing ". [1]

[3]  They were previously considered official and can still be correct, as long as they follow the official gameplay rules, or unless Konami has issued a ruling that says otherwise.

 Mentions in Other Rulings 
 Light and Darkness Dragon : When a monster is Summoned that has an effect that activates at the time the monster is successfully Summoned (“ Zaborg the Thunder Monarch ”, “ Breaker the Magical Warrior ”, etc.) while “ Light and Darkness Dragon ” is face-up on the field, the effect of the Summoned monster will be  Chain  Link 1 and “ Light and Darkness Dragon ” will be Chain Link 2. Because of this, it is not possible to use “ Pulling the Rug ” to negate the effect of the monster if it was Normal Summoned. 
 Mausoleum of the Emperor : A  monster   Normal Summoned  with the effect of " Mausoleum of the Emperor " is NOT  Tribute Summoned . So if you  pay  1000  Life Points  and  Normal Summon  " Zaborg the Thunder Monarch ", its effect will not  activate . 
 Judge List Rulings 
 " Monarch 's" effects activate at the time they are successfully  Tribute Summoned . Their effects are  Spell Speed 1 . If the opponent wants to activate a card like " Bottomless Trap Hole ", it will be placed onto the Chain with the " Monarch 's" effect. But " Monarchs " don't need to remain on the field to resolve their effects, so destroying them with " Bottomless Trap Hole " will not negate their effect. [2]
