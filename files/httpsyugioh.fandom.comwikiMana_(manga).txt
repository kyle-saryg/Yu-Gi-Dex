 Design 
 Mana's design is based on " Dark Magician Girl ". Her standard outfit consists of a beige shoulderless, sleeveless top with ruffled straps around her upper arm, a beige miniskirt, charmed bracelets around her wrists and ankles and matching necklace, belt and headwear. The character is slender and her brown hair is sporadically arranged and juts downwards in all directions. 
 
 Biography 
 Mana is described as a young magician in training who serves the priest  Mahado . [1] 
  Her first appearance began as an apprentice to Mahado. She once appeared before Mahado after hiding in the pots outside of the palace. Mahado sensed her there and told her to come out. After popping out of the pot, she exclaimed how she would do her training later and Mahado responded by telling her she would never become a sorcerer that way. [2] 
 
       Seto upon being crowned pharaoh, with  Isis  and Mana     
 After Mahado's death, she swore to become a great magician and eventually was able to summon her own  ka , the  Dark Magician Girl .
 After Zorc's death in the  Shadow RPG , Mana became a Priestess and wielder of the  Millennium Ring  under the newly crowned Pharaoh,  Seto . Sometime afterwards, she died and her soul was among others waiting for Atem as he passed into the afterlife.
