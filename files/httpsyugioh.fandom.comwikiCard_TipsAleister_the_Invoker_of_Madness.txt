 This card can be Link Summoned with " Aleister the Invoker " and a " Inari Fire ", " Jigabyte ", " Nefarious Archfiend Eater of Nefariousness ", or " Ranryu " that can Special Summon themselves if the player controls "Aleister". That monster can then be banished from the Graveyard as Fusion Material for an " Invoked " monster. 
 This may have synergy in a " Thunder Dragon " Deck, by being Link Summoned with "Aleister the Invoker" and a "Thunder Dragon" monster. Then, both Link Materials can be used to Fusion Summon " Invoked Mechaba ", triggering the effect of that "Thunder Dragon" in the process. 
 This card can be special summoned in a " Fairy Tale " Deck by instantly summoning " Prinzessin " and " Pumpkin Carriage ".
