 Biography 
 Ancient Egypt 
 When  Atem ,  Shada  and  Mahado , as Dark Magician, battled  Bakura , at  Kul Elna ,  Mana  arrived with the other priests. She summoned Dark Magician Girl in time to rescue Mahado from one of  Diabound 's attacks. [1]  Mana was able to communicate with Mahado through Dark Magician Girl, expressing her joy to see him alive. As Dark Magician Girl was not yet capable of fighting, she gave her heka to Mahado, who had been weakened. [2] 
 
 1990s 
 Egyptian ka battles were recreated through the  Duel Monsters  card game, which included a " Dark Magician Girl " card.  Yugi Mutou , as  Dark Yugi  used it in a number of his Duels.
