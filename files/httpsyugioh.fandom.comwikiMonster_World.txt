      Monster World in the anime     
 Monster World  is a tabletop RPG (Role Playing Game), similar to Dungeons and Dragons, from the  manga , which also appears in the  first series anime .
 
 Setup 
 The board is Bakura's custom 10x20 setup, including a town, forest, and castle areas. 
 The Dark Master plays the monsters and the "boss" of the adventure. The adventurers try to defeat the Dark Master. 
 Bakura used his computer to enter the character data. 
 In areas where monsters appear, Bakura rolls two ten-sided dice, to get a number from 0 to 99. If the number is less than the probability of a monster appearing, a monster will appear. The monsters are stronger the lower the number rolled. 
 If a player rolled a 99 (critical fumble), or Bakura rolled a 00 for Zorc (supercritical hit), the player would be trapped inside their character's miniature.
