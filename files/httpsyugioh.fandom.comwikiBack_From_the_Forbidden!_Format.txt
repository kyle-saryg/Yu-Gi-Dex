Back From the Forbidden! Format  is a Deck format used in some  Pegasus Challenge  tournaments. It uses a unique  Forbidden  and  Limited  list, based on the current  Advanced Format .
 In this format, a large number of  Forbidden  cards are  Limited  instead, but unlike the  Traditional Format  some cards are still Forbidden.
 This is the only Pegasus Challenge format that was not previously a  Pegasus League  format.
