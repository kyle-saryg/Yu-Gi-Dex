 Biography 
 Esper Roba is a young Duelist who enters the  Battle City  tournament. He Duels  Dinosaur Ryuzaki , and defeats him, taking his rarest card through the ante rules. Espa claims to have the power of reading the cards in the opponent's hand. Despite Ryuzaki's warnings,  Jonouchi  is willing to  Duel  him.
 Espa had an upper hand at the beginning of the Duel, claiming that the spirit of  Pegasus  is speaking to him. When Jonouchi puts the cards " Skull Dice " and " Graceful Dice " close together, his brothers from the building think that Jonouchi has 2 copies of "Graceful Dice", and when Esper said that, and was proven wrong, he was revealed to be a fraud, forcing his brothers to stop. 
 Esper Summons " Jinzo ", which was strengthened with " Amplifier ". He was about to win the Duel, until Jonouchi activated " Roulette Spider ", which was a risky card which would make one player win the Duel. Jonouchi got lucky, so "Jinzo" attacked Esper's " Reflect Bounder ", and due to the effect of "Reflect Bounder", "Jinzo" gets destroyed, and Esper loses the remainder of his  Life Points .
 Through the ante rule, Esper gave his "Jinzo" card to Jonouchi, respecting him as a worthy opponent.
