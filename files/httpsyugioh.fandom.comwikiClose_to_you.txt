 Lyrics (TV Size) 
 Rōmaji English 
 Close to you Daijinakoto muneni kizamikonde 
kimi no sobade kagayaku tsuyoi kokoro wa hitotsu dake nanda 
fuan o kakushite mie o hatte itsumo 
darenimo mimi o kasanaide tsuyogari nagara 
nandomo nandomo kurikaeshi iki tsuzuketeru 
boku no kokoro wa kowarerukurai ni sakendeta 
sonna koto wa hayame ni suteyou 
ashita ni susumu dake dakara 
Close to you jibun rashisa sagashite iru no nara saigomade kimeta koto o mamotte ike ba ii sa 
Close to you daijina koto muneni kizamikonde 
 
kimi no sobade kagayaku tsuyoi kokoro wa hitotsu dake nanda 
 Close to you, engrave that precious moment into my heart 
There's only one strong and shining spirit right next to you, after all 
Always masking my fears and putting up a front, 
While I try to be the tough guy, not listening to anyone,  
Over and over it goes, my life goes on repetitively  
My heart's been screaming so hard it might break 
Gonna hurry and toss all that stuff away, 
'Cause I just want to move on to tomorrow 
Close to you, if you're looking for what defines you, then keep on protecting your decisions until the very end 
Close to you, engrave that precious moment into my heart 
 
There's only one strong and shining spirit right next to you, after all
