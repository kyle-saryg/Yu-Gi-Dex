 Summary 
   This summary is currently incomplete. 
 Yuya  deliberately attracted  Ren 's attention to settle things with a turbo duel at the particle accelerator he decided to be their race course. However,  Yuzu  having objected to Yuya risking himself,  Yugo  takes over Yuya's body to duel in his place and ignores Yuzu's pleas to reconsider. 
 As their turbo duel begins, Ren reveals the Duel Runner he is riding to be a more advanced model as he moves ahead of Yugo while summoning White Aura Whale. Determined to win, Yugo Pendulum Summons Speedroid Passing Rider and then Normal Summons Speedroid Domino Butterfly to Synchro Summon Clearwing Fast Dragon. Watching the second turn of the duel unfold,  Yuto  assumes Yugo's dueling style might give him an edge while  Yuri  is more concerned over their weakening connection to Yuya.
 Within the deepest recesses of his mind, unable to see the duel unfold, Yuya stands alone in a rocky wasteland and wanders before being aghast when he peers over a cliff.
 
 Featured Duel: Yugo vs. Ren 
 This Duel is conducted as an  Action Duel . Both players can obtain and use  Action Cards .
 Turn 1: Ren 
 Ren  obtains an  Action Card . He  sends  " White Moray " from his  hand  to the Graveyard to  Special Summon  " White Stingray " (1400/1000) from his  hand . Next, he  activates  " White Mirror ", Special Summoning "Moray" back and  adding  a second copy of it to his hand, which he subsequently  Normal Summons  (600/200). Due to its own  effect , the "Moray" Summoned from the Graveyard becomes a  tuner monster ; Ren tunes the Level 4 "Stingray" and the Level 2 "Moray" with the Level 2 Tuner "Moray" to  Synchro Summon  " White Aura Whale " (2800/2000). He then activates " White Salvation ", adding one "Moray" back to his hand. Ren  sets  1 card.
 Turn 2: Yugo 
Ren obtains another Action Card.  Yugo  Sets his  Pendulum Scales  with " Speedroid Marble Machine " (PS: 1) and " Speedroid Hexasaucer " (PS: 6), allowing him to  Pendulum Summon  " Speedroid Passing Rider " (2200/2000). He then  Normal Summons  the tuner monster " Speedroid Domino Butterfly ". Yugo tunes the Level 5 "Passing Rider" with the Level 2 Tuner "Domino Butterfly" to Synchro Summon " Clearwing Fast Dragon " (2500/2000). Yugo activates its effect, reducing the  ATK  of "Whale" to zero and negating its effect ("Whale": 2800 → 0 ATK). Ren activates his  face-down  " White Arbitration ", sending "Moray" from his hand to the Graveyard to switch "Clearwing" to  Defense Position , but Yugo activates the  Pendulum Effect  of "Marble Machine", switching it back to  Attack Position . "Clearwing"  attacks  and  destroys  "Whale", but Ren activates the Action Card " Full Fairing ", halving the  damage  (Ren: 4000 → 2750 LP). Upon its destruction, Ren activates the effect of "Whale",  banishing  "Stingray" from his Graveyard to Special Summon "Whale" back (2800/2000), with its effect activating to destroy "Clearwing", but the other effect of "Marble Machine" prevents it from being destroyed this  turn . Yugo Sets 1 card.
 Duel continues in the next Scale .
