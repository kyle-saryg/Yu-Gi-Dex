 Summary 
 Chancellor Sheppard  has announced that the finals of the tournament will be held on the school's roof, in an arena that is modeled after the  Duel Tower  from the  Battle City  tournament. Only the top two scoring third year students are usually allowed to set foot there. Despite this,  Jaden Yuki  and  Chazz Princeton  will be permitted to have their rematch there to decide the tournament's winner. Despite their excitement, both are preoccupied with the plans of the American students, and Chazz notices that  Reggie MacKenzie  has disappeared. They are further distracted from this when the notice that  Atticus Rhodes  has arrived, and is standing with  Zane Truesdale . Zane comments that Atticus came back quite quickly, especially after he had petitioned Sheppard to allow him to stay in America longer. He explains that his reason was the he wanted to stay close to Reggie MacKenzie, and he wasn't aware that she was accompanying Zane back. Atticus departs to find Reggie, planning on watching the duel on the monitors in the hallways.
 Jaden and Chazz agree to put the plans of the American students out of their minds so they can focus on their duel. At the infirmary,  Nurse Fontaine  checks  David Rabb 's condition as  Midori Hibiki  looks on and Reggie eavesdrops from outside the door. Fontaine can recall reading about similar cases that took place during the finals of the Battle City tournament. A total of four duelists had collapsed, and  two   of them  were said to have done so simultaneously due to some form of sorcery. Fontaine refuses to believe it, and thinks that records are fake. Midori leaves to watch the final match and is confronted by Reggie outside the door.
 Jaden and Chazz arrive at the arena, and their rematch finally begins. Jaden goes first,  Summoning  " Elemental Hero Knospe " in  Defense Position  and  Setting  a card. Chazz Summons " Guivre " in  Attack Position , who attacks and destroys "Knospe", while  Special Summoning  a " Wyvern Token " via its own  effect . Jaden Summons " Elemental Hero Woodsman " and plays " Miracle Fusion ",  removing  "Woodsman" from his  field  and "Knospe" in his  Graveyard  from play to  Fusion Summon  " Elemental Hero Gaia " in Attack Position, whose effect activates, halving "Guivre's" attack points and adding them to its own. "Gaia" attacks, but Chazz activates his face-down " Dragon Descent ",  Tributing  "Guivre" and the "Wyvern Token" to Special Summon the  Level  8 " Dark End Dragon " from his hand in Attack Position. Chazz activates its effect, decreasing its attack points by 500 to destroy "Gaia". Jaden activates his face-down " New Recruit ", Special Summoning " Elemental Hero Frost Blade " from his  Deck , who cannot be  destroyed by battle  with or affected by the effects of Level 4 and higher monsters. Chazz Summons " Dynamite Dragon " in Attack Position and activates " Dragon's Wrath ", granting his  Dragon - Type  monsters the  piercing  ability for the rest of the turn. "Dynamite Dragon" attacks "Frost Blade" and Chazz declares an attack with "Dark End Dragon" as the chapter ends.
