 During the opening of the  Duel Team Carnival , someone hacked the  Obots , causing a huge riot. The members of  Team ZEXAL  found the building where the hacker was and went after him; [1]  however, Fusion Mask intercepted them, saying he was the guardian of the first Web Point. He tried to catch  Kaito  with an arm ring, but  Haruto  protected him, being caught instead. He explained that the ring would cause strong electric shocks whenever the Duelist suffered damage. Fusion Mask and Kaito then  Dueled , with Kaito emerging victorious. Upon Fusion Mask's defeat,  Master Evil  appears as a hologram, punishing Fusion Mask for failing by triggering his arm ring.
