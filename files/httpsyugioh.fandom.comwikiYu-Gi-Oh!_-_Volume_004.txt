 Stories 
 Seto Kaiba  seeks revenge on  Yugi  for defeating him in  Duel Monsters  and subjecting him to a  Penalty Game . He subjects Yugi and his friends to  Death-T , a theme park of death, designed to kill Yugi.
 
 Foreword 
 In the foreword,  Kazuki Takahashi  talks about how he played  Shogi  at a street stall. There was a puzzle where one could win ¥30,000 if they find checkmate in eight moves. Takahashi rose to the challenge, but failed on the eight move. The man at the stall then held out his hand, saying that it was ¥1000 for each move. This detail wasn't on the sign and cost Takahashi ¥8000.
 
 Bonus game 
 At the end of the volume, there was a bonus game, titled "Thrilling Board Game".
 The game was for five players. The next fives pages included a grid. All players put their on the square labeled "Start" and roll a die to see who goes first, second, third, etc. Players then take turns rolling the die. If they roll a 1, they can move 1 square in any direction. If they roll a 6, they can move one or two squares in any direction. If they roll a 2,3 or 4, they move in the direction indicated in the grid.
 
 If a die roll tells a player to move into a rock, they stay still. 
 If a die roll tells a player to move over an edge, they warp back to the starting square. If there is person playing the game, they lose if they fall over an edge. 
 If a die roll tells a player to move onto an edge square that another player is on, the moving player can push the other player off the edge, if the edge is in the direction that they are moving. 
 Some squares tell players to warp to another square, when a player stops on them. 
 If a player stops in the goal area, they win.
