 History 
 After forming the team, the members make a reunion, to which  Yuma  arrives late. The members were worried about Yuma being the leader, since he didn't seem much appropriate.  Tetsuo  then challenges him to a  Duel  - if Tetsuo won, he would be the leader instead. Yuma accepts the challenge, and wins, so the others accept him as the leader. [2] 
 The team later enters the  Team Duel Tournament . Yuma Dueled  Gauche  in order for his team to participate, and won. [3]  In the first round, Team ZEXAL faces  Team Fire Stars . [4]  The first Duel is Yuma Tsukumo vs.  Shota Geki , which ends with Yuma's win.  Tetsuo  grants a second win for Team ZEXAL, while  Takashi  loses his match. With two wins, Team ZEXAL is the winner, and obtains their first  Digital Stone . [5] 
 Their second match is against  Team lswarm , which takes place in the  Heartland Theme Park  Horror Tower. [6] 
 Later, Team ZEXAL is shown to have earned 7 Digital Stones, with only 1 missing so that they can advance in the tournament. Then, their match for the 8th Digital Stone is against  Team Air Force , who also has got 7 Digital Stones. [7] 
 Team ZEXAL then finally advances to the finals, where they face  Team Shark . [8]
