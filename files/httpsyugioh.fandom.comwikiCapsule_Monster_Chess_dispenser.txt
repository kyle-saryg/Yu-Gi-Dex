      A dispenser.     
 A  Capsule Monster Chess dispenser  is a vending machine used to sell  Capsule Monster Chess  pieces.
 The buyer inserts a ¥100 (about $0.84 US at the time) coin into a slot and turns a key. A capsule from the bottom of the machine then rolls out through a hole. [1]  Normally the buyer cannot tell what Capsule Monster they will get, however  Mokuba  has rigged such machines on occasion. [1] [2] 
 There is a dispenser outside  Old Man Dentures  candy store.  Yugi  got in trouble for rattling the machine after his capsule got jammed after inserting a coin. Mokuba who had paid Dentures took the dispenser, which he had secretly rigged and used it to dispense monsters for him and Yugi to use in a game. Since he had the machine rigged, Yugi got mostly low Level monsters, while Mokuba got high Level monsters. [1] 
 During  Death-T , Mokuba used a rigged dispenser again to face Yugi in another game of Capsule Monster Chess. [2] 
 In the  first series anime , Yugi's encounter with Mokuba using a rigged dispenser was replaced with  Warashibe  using a rigged dispenser to face  Miho Nosaka . [3]
