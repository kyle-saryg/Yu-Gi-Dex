 Toon monsters  (トゥーンモンスター  Tūn Monsutā ) are cartoonized counterparts of existing monsters, having some reliance on the card " Toon World ".
 Originally, in the manga and anime, Toon monsters were formed by having the effect of " Toon World " applied to non-Toon monsters. These Toon monsters had the ability to avoid being destroyed in battle.
 In the  OCG  and  TCG , Toon is an  ability . Toon monsters exist as separate cards than their non-Toon counterpart, with whom they share no direct in-game relationship. They are capable of attacking the opponent directly and while they benefit from the card " Toon World ", they can be used without it. There are  five classes  of "Toon monsters", dubbed by fans Class A, B, C, D, and E.
 All Toon monsters belong to the " Toon " archetype (including " Manga Ryu-Ran ", since its Japanese name contains トゥーン).
 Toon monsters were the first Effect Monsters with an ability to be introduced, debuting in  Spell Ruler . While  Flip monsters  (as Flip Effect Monsters) were introduced earlier, they were not treated as having an ability until much later.
 Toon monsters can also be  Special Summon Monsters .

 While " Toon World " is on the field, each of its controllers monsters are converted to their Toon counterparts.
 In their Toon form, monsters could dodge attacks and hide within the "Toon World" book.
 Although "Toon World" was used with "Dark Rabbit", "Dragon Capture Jar" and "Bickuribox", they were not given separate names while affected and "Dragon Capture Jar" did not demonstrate the ability to dodge attacks.
