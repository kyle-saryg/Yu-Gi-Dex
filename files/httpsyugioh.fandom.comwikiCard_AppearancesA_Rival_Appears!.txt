 Yu-Gi-Oh! GX 
 Though " A Rival Appears! " is never seen played in an actual duel, it is shown that  Alexis Rhodes  has one in her deck as shown in the third season Japanese anime ending featuring Taiyou. 
 Yu-Gi-Oh! 5D's 
 In  episode 35 , this card was seen as one of the many cards that  Rally ,  Blitz ,  Nervin , and  Tank  threw into the air in order to distract some Satellite residents who wanted  Yusei Fudo 's Duel Runner (Yusei's friends knew the Runner was more important than their cards, so they threw the latter into the air as a distraction). 
 Yu-Gi-Oh! 3D Bonds Beyond Time 
 This card appears in  Paradox 's explanation when he tells Yugi, Jaden, and Yusei that the reason why he came to the past was so that he could prevent his own bad future from happening. Yugi, Jaden, and Yusei disagreed with going along with Paradox's plan as Paradox's actions will destroy and ruin their eras in time since they revolved around Duel Monsters.
