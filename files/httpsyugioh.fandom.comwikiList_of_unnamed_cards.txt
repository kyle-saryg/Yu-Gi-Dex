 Manga Yu-Gi-Oh! Duel 009 cards A number of  Monster Cards  that appear on the counter at  Kame Game  as  Sugoroku  explains the rules of  Duel Monsters  to  Yugi  and his friends in  Chapter 9 . The only ones with visible names were " Summoned Skull ", " Hell-Bound ", and " Giant Soldier of Stone ". Another card from this scene appeared, labeled only as an "ally," as a character in the dice game included with  Volume 3 .
 Yugi's Duel 010 cards A number of unnamed monsters played by Yugi during his first Duel with  Seto Kaiba  in an attempt to stall his opponent's powerful " Giant's Might "- equipped  " Battle Ox ," including a bird/fishlike creature and a bald, tattooed figure. All are quickly destroyed by "Battle Ox."
 Kaiba's Duel 010 monster A magician-looking monster played by Kaiba during his first Duel with Yugi.
 Yugi's Death-T monsters A number of monsters played by Yugi during his final showdown with Kaiba at  Death-T . The first three seen are all destroyed by Kaiba's powered-up " Saggi the Dark Clown ," while the fourth appears in Yugi's hand. The second and third monsters seen are replaced by " Chimæra " and " Gremlin " respectively in the  first series anime  adaptation of the manga Duel.
 Kaiba's Death-T monster A turtle-like monster Kaiba played in  Defense Position  during his Death-T Duel with Yugi during the time his " Blue-Eyes White Dragons " are immobilized by Yugi's " Swords of Revealing Light ." It appears in both the manga and the first series anime.
 Yugi's round monster A spherical, insect-like monster Yugi played in Defense Position during his Duel with  Insector Haga  in the manga.
 Ventriloquist of the Dead's monster A one-eyed monster played by the  Ventriloquist of the Dead  during his Duel with Yugi. It likely originally belonged to Kaiba's Deck. In the anime, in which  Ghost Kaiba  took place as Yugi's opponent, he used  Mystic Horseman  instead.
 Mai's opponent's monster A monster played by a  Duelist Kingdom  opponent of  Mai Kujaku 's in the manga, which was destroyed by Mai's " Harpie Lady Sisters ", winning Mai the Duel.
 Jonouchi's monsters The first is a knight-like monster played in Defense Position during  Jonouchi 's Duel with  Dinosaur Ryuzaki  in the manga.
 The second was used in Jonouchi's  Duelist Kingdom  Duel against  Kaiba .
 Against Ryuzaki Against Kaiba Chicken In the manga, a  Level  3 chicken-like monster was shown, while the  Meikŷu Brothers  explained the rules of the  Labyrinth Duel .
 The chicken Pegasus' monster During his final Duel with Yugi in the manga,  Pegasus  uses this monster along with " Dark-Eyes Illusionist " to  Ritual Summon  " Relinquished ." "Relinquished" resembles a combination of "Dark-Eyes Illusionist" and this card. In the anime, Pegasus uses "Dark-Eyes Illusionist" alone for the Ritual Summon.
 As it met the conditions for " Black Illusion Ritual ", it is an  Illusion  monster and has less than 100  ATK .
 Ryuzaki's monster During his Duel with  Esper Roba  in the manga,  Dinosaur Ryuzaki  used this monster. Roba put it to sleep with " Mesmeric Control ", before destroying it with " Jinzo ". In the anime, it is replaced with " Serpent Night Dragon ".
 Battle City participants' monsters Two generic  Battle City  Duelists were shown using these two cards, one of which is a dragon, while the other is a knight.
 An aerial view of another Duel showed another three unnamed cards.
 Dragon and knight Nagumo's opponent's card A Duelist defeated by  Koji Nagumo  used this card. Koji won it through the ante rule, but demanded another rare card, as he thought its value did not compare to the card he wagered, " Hyozanryu ".
 Pandora's monster A pumpkin-headed monster of  Pandora 's that he sacrifices along with Yugi's " Beta the Magnet Warrior " by way of " Coffin of Dark Resurrection " to Summon " Dark Magician ", in the manga. In the anime adaptation, he uses " Mystic Tomato " instead.
 Card Artwork Solid Vision Bakura's card A card seen in  Dark Bakura 's hand during his  Battle City  Duel with Dark Yugi, in the manga. It is unspecified whether this is a Monster, Spell or Trap Card. It is hypothesized to be " Poltergeists ", a card which is used by Dark Bakura.

 Jim's monster Jim Crocodile Cook  used this monster against  Bastion Misawa . He  Tributed  it alongside " Spawn Alligator " to  Tribute Summon  " The Tyrant Neptune ". The  effect  of "The Tyrant Neptune" makes its own  ATK  the combined value of the Tributed monsters. Its ATK here was 3800, implying that this card's ATK was 1600, since the ATK of "Spawn Alligator" is 2200. [5] 
 Yu-Gi-Oh! 5D's Kalin's monster A monster used by  Kalin Kessler  while he was a teen in the manga. [6] 
 
 Yu-Gi-Oh! ARC-V Reiji's card A card used by  Reiji Akaba  while  Dueling   Yuya Sakaki . Before playing this card, Reiji claimed that he would show Yuya the true power that  his father  left him.

 Hyakunin Isshu Field A  Field Spell Card  used during the  Friendship Games . [15]  The "Duel" held here is similar to a game of  Karuta . This field was cut from the English dub, likely because of the difficulty of translating the Karuta-like "Duel" for western viewers.
 Alito's Spell Alito  used an unnamed  Spell Card  to change his  Warrior - Type  " Battlin' Boxer Big Bandages " to  Beast -Type. The card was neither shown nor seen, but his opponent  Girag  asked him why he "used that Spell Card" to do so. The card went unmentioned entirely in the dub. [16]
