 The Japanese name of this card ( Ancient Rainbow City - Rainbow Ruin ) can be translated in Greek as " Αρχαία Πόλη του Ουράνιου Τόξου - Ερείπια του Ουράνιου Τόξου ". 
 The Spanish name of this card seems to suffer from a mistranslation, as the word " Ruins " was translated as a synonym of " doom " instead of refering to the remains of architectural remains (" ruinas ", in Spanish).
