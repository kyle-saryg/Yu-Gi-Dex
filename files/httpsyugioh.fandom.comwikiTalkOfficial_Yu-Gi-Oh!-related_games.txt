Cards missing 
 Is it worth adding, for each game or at least the ones we know, cards which were not in some of these games despite having had a release in the OCG/TCG, such as modern games' lack of some fusion materials and the guardian monsters?

 Ordered by release date 
 Can you please make a list ordered by release date? Or is there one on the internet? Thanks.  —This unsigned comment was made by  46.184.255.91  ( talk  •  contribs ) 00:26, August 10, 2012‎ (UTC)
