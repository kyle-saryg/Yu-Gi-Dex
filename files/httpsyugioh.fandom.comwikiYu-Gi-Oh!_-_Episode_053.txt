 Featured Duel: Yami Yugi vs. Johnny Steps 
 Turn 1: Johnny 
 Johnny Steps  draws. He then  Normal Summons  " Sonic Maid " (1200/900) in  Attack Position .
 Turn 2: Yami Yugi 
 Yami Yugi  draws " Celtic Guardian " and subsequently Normal Summons it (1400/1200) in  Attack Position . "Celtic Guardian"  attacks  and  destroys  "Sonic Maid" ( Johnny  2000 → 1800).
 Turn 3: Johnny 
 Johnny Steps  draws " Water Omotics " and subsequently Normal Summons it (1400/1200) in  Attack Position .
 Turn 4: Yami Yugi 
 Yami Yugi   draws . He then passes his turn.
 Turn 5: Johnny 
 Johnny  draws " Spirit of the Harp " and subsequently Normal Summons it (800/2000) in  Defense Position . He then  activates  " Chorus of Sanctuary " to increase the  DEF  of every  Defense Position   monster  on his side of the field by 500 ("Spirit of the Harp": 800/2000 → 2500).
 Turn 6: Yami Yugi 
 Yami Yugi  draws. He then  Normal Summons  " Curse of Dragon " (2000/1500) in  Attack Position . "Curse of Dragon"  attacks  and  destroys  "Water Omotics" ( Johnny  1800 → 1200).
 Turn 7: Johnny 
 Johnny  draws " Witch of the Black Forest " and subsequently Normal Summons it (1100/1200) in Defense Position. He then  activates  " Polymerization " to fuse "Witch of the Black Forest" with the " Lady of Faith " in his  hand  and  Fusion Summon  " Musician King " (1750/1500) in  Attack Position . "Musician King"  attacks  and  destroys  "Celtic Guardian" ( Yami Yugi  2000 → 1650).  Johnny  then  Sets  a card.
 Turn 8: Yami Yugi 
"Curse of Dragon"  attacks  "Musician King", but  Johnny   activates  his face-down " Metalmorph " to transform "Musician King" into " Heavy Metal King " as well as increase his  ATK  and  DEF  by 300 ("Heavy Metal King": 1750 → 2050/1500 → 1800). "Heavy Metal King"  destroys  "Curse of Dragon" ( Yami Yugi  1650 → 1600).  Yami Yugi   Normal Summons  " Giant Soldier of Stone " (1300/2000) in  Defense Position .
 Turn 9: Johnny 
"Heavy Metal King"  attacks  "Giant Soldier of Stone". The effect of "Metalmorph" activates, increasing its ATK by half the ATK of "Giant Soldier of Stone" during damage calculation ("Heavy Metal King": 2050 → 2700/1800) only. "Heavy Metal King"  destroys  "Giant Soldier of Stone". After damage calculation, the effect of "Metalmorph" expires ("Heavy Metal King": 2700 → 2050/1800).
 Turn 10: Yami Yugi 
(Johnny Steps has “ Battle Warrior ” in his hand)
 Yami Yugi   Normal Summons  " Dark Magician " in  Attack Position . "Dark Magician"  attacks  and  destroys  "Heavy Metal King" ( Johnny  1200 → 750).  Johnny  thinks there must be a mistake because as the effect of "Metalmorph" should have raised the  ATK  of "Metalmorph" to 3300; making him stronger than "Dark Magician".  Yami Yugi  explains that the effect of "Metalmorph" on increasing the equipped monster's ATK only  activates  when " Heavy Metal King "  attacks ,  not  when it's  attacked  by another monster. 
 Johnny , at this point, asks  Yami Yugi  for his name. When he finds out that his opponent is the duelist who defeated  Maximillion Pegasus  at  Duelist Kingdom ,  Johnny  quits.
 
 Errors 
 Before Johnny and Yami Yugi say, "Let's Duel!", the scene backs out and shows Yami Yugi far away, without the blue band on his left arm. 
 When Johnny is shown summoning " Spirit of the Harp ", " Water Omotics " attack and defense points on the card are swapped. 
 When " Musician King " is first summoned in the Japanese version, it is shown to have 1700 attack points instead of the correct 1750, which is shown in the English dub when first summoned, although when it attacks " Celtic Guardian " in the original, it still causes Yami to lose 350 life points instead of 300. 
 When Johnny activates " Metalmorph ", the Musician King's attack points on the card is shown to be 1800 instead of the correct 1750. 
 When "Metalmorph" is played and Musician King becomes " Heavy Metal King ", its defense points increase by the wrong amount of 200 instead of 300, causing it to have only 1700 defense points. However, the next time Heavy Metal King attacks, targeting " Giant Soldier of Stone ", it is shown to have the correct amount of 1800. 
 Yami Yugi's Life Points aren't shown decreasing after Heavy Metal King destroys " Curse of Dragon ". 
 After Summoning the " Dark Magician " and talking to Johnny, Yami Yugi doesn't have the blue band on his left arm again, this time in a close-up scene when pointing to Johnny. 
 Quotes 
 Yugi:  Ready or not, Spirit, this is where you take over.  (the  Millennium Puzzle ’s eye flashes, switching control of his body to Yami) 
 Yami:   (blinks a little before turning to the puzzle)  Hey! Yugi, I’m not... you can’t — this isn’t a duel!  (He looks up to see Téa staring at him)  Hello.
 
 
 Johnny:  Boo!  (Yami and Téa turn around and see him)  Do you geeks mind if I  step  in? 
 Téa:   (annoyed)   Now  what do you want from us? 
 Johnny:  I’ve come down here to humbly ask for a second chance. 
 Téa:  Second chance? 
 Johnny:  I’d have easily won if my leg hadn’t cramped up. I think that you owe me a rematch. 
 Téa:   (holds her hand to her head in frustration)  Give it up. 
 Yami:   (as Téa turns to him in surprise)  Huh —  I’ll  give you a rematch. But we’ll duel  my  way. 
 Téa:  What? 
 Johnny:   (angrily, to Yami)  Stay out of this, porcupine head. This battle is just between me and the girl! 
 Yami:  Téa, may I finish off your opponent? 
 Téa:  Uh, sure. 
 Johnny:  Good. I’m not afraid of either of you. Name your game, you little freak. 
 Yami:  The game is Duel Monsters. And if you lose, you’re never to bother Téa again. 
 Johnny:  Fine. Only, if I win, the girl will have to go out on a date with Johnny Steps.  (Téa looks over at Yami, worried, while Yami simply smiles confidently)
