       Linework     
 Thunder , known in Japan as  Ikazuchimaru  (雷丸) is one of the four members of the  Light Brigade  led by  Sarina . He and fellow member  Frost  were called upon by  Sarina  to battle  Syrus Truesdale  and  Tyranno Hassleberry  after they kidnapped  Solomon Muto  and baited them to the top of a large building in  Domino City . Unlike Frost, he was more willing to use teamwork to win. He was given a copy of " Mirror of Duality " by Sarina, but could not use it since his  Life Points  were too low. However, Frost himself played the same card and won the Duel, with Thunder losing all his Life Points along with their opponents. He was sealed in a mirror by  Sarina  when she no longer had any use for him, but was freed alongside the other Light Brigade Duelists after  Jaden Yuki  and  Aster Phoenix  defeated her.
 The "Ikazuchi" portion of his name in the Japanese version is derived from the word "ikazuchi" (雷), meaning "lightning". 
 Thunder travels through thunder, and seems to be in control of the " Zaborg the Thunder Monarch " spirit that presided over the city during his  Tag-Team Duel .
 
 Deck 
 Thunder plays a  Thunder  Deck , supported by  Tag-Team Duel -exclusive cards. His tactics are less standard than his partner's in that he utilizes cards such as " Rampage Condenser " and " Lightning Talisman " to inflict  damage  through effects, rather than through battle. His primary card is " Zaborg the Thunder Monarch ".
