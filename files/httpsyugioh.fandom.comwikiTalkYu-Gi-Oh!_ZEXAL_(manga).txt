 No Updates 
 I know there are many people here in the Wikia that have access to the manga, but no chapters are updated. The last posted one is Rank 007, and the last released chapter was Rank 014. And the fact of the history starting differing on Rank 009 on is one more reason to update the chapters. I'd do that myself, but I don't know where I can read the manga, I just found until chapter 6. So, for the ones who can read the manga, please update it or just tell me where can I read it. Thanks.  LegenaryAsariUgetsu  ( talk  •  contribs ) January 21st, 2012, 18:40 (UTC)
 
 I do not have access to most of the chapters. There are around three or four I can eventually get around to creating. Access to the chapters isn't that easy, especially since the US government just shut down megaupload.  Cheesedude  ( talk  •  contribs ) 19:24, January 21, 2012 (UTC) 
 Some of them are available at Janime download forum. --  The Goblin   Talk    19:30, January 21, 2012 (UTC)

 Rank 28 
 Shouldn't there be a "Rank 28" in the  Yu-Gi-Oh! ZEXAL  manga?  I mean, chapters are usually posted on the 21 st  of every month; so why isn't there a 28 yet? -- Yes, it's PSYCHID!   He talks!   He does stuff!  02:27, March 23, 2013 (UTC)
 It exists:  http://neoarkcradle.net/forum/viewtopic.php?f=14&t=2639 
 I find it strange that we don't have any of the newer manga issues up on the main page yet, though. I'm sure one of the higher-ups here could do something about that if you ask them.  Blatch  ( talk  •  contribs ) 02:32, March 23, 2013 (UTC)
 
 It's because I still don't have enough info on the chapter to make the article. I'll be receiving it soon though, then I'll add it, don't worry. I've already created the article for  this month's 5D's  though.  LegendaryAsariUgetsu  ( talk  •  contribs ) 17:14, March 23, 2013 (UTC) 
 Covers 
 Is it really needed to add 5 different covers for the volume covers? I personally think the Japanese and English ones would be enough already. At least, if so many covers will be displayed, we could make them slide format or something.  LegendaryAsariUgetsu  ( talk  •  contribs ) 22:31, December 16, 2014 (UTC)
 
 While we do want the covers for as many versions as we can get, I agree that we probably only need the English and Japanese covers here; the others should instead be shown on the individual volumes' articles (and the promo card articles as appropriate).  「 ディノ 奴 千？！ 」 ?  ·  ☎ Dinoguy1000  05:23, December 17, 2014 (UTC) 
 Agreed on all counts.  Cheesedude  ( talk  •  contribs ) 05:34, December 17, 2014 (UTC)
