 Lillybot's turn 
 
                 WindUpZenmaister   The Summoning of " Wind-Up Zenmaister "     
 Yuma's LP are  damaged  through unknown means (Yuma: 2500 → 1900 LP). Lillybot  activates  her  face-down  " Star Light, Star Bright " to target both "Teapot Kangaroo" and "Camelcycle" and change the  Level  of "Teapot Kangaroo" to that of "Camelcycle" (as they have the same  ATK ) ("Teapot Kangaroo":   3 → 4). Lillybot  overlays  "Teapot Kangaroo" and "Camelcycle" in order to  Xyz Summon  " Wind-Up Zenmaister " ( 4/1900/1500, ORU: 2) in Attack Position. "Zenmaister"  attacks   directly  (Yuma: 1900 → 0 LP).
 
 Yuma Tsukumo and Bronk Stone vs. Lillybot

 Yuma's and Bronk's  LP  are  damaged  through unknown means (Yuma: 0 LP, Bronk: 0 LP).
 
 Yuma Tsukumo vs. Lillybot (second) 
 Turn 1: Yuma 
 Yuma   draws . He then  Normal Summons  " Gagaga Magician " ( 4/1500/1000) in Attack Position and  Sets  a card.
 Turn 2: Lillybot 
 
                 Recycle Rerhinobot   The Summoning of " Recycle Rhinobot "     
 Lillybot  draws. She then  activates  " Eco Spell - Reduce Waste " to banish " Junk Robot Cleanaga " and " Junk Robot Computerkong " from her Deck and add " Junk Robot Camelcycle " from her Deck to her hand (as the banished monsters are " Junk Robot " and the added monster is also a "Junk Robot". Lillybot Normal Summons "Camelcycle" ( 4/800/1600) in Attack Position. She then activates " Eco Spell - Recycle " to Special Summon "Cleanaga" ( 4/1200/800) and "Computerkong" ( 4/1000/1000) in  Attack Position  (as the Special Summoned monsters are "Junk Robots"). 
 Lillybot  overlays  "Camelcycle", "Cleanaga" and "Computerkong" in order to  Xyz Summon  " Recycle Rhinobot " ( 4/2700/2000, ORU: 3) in Attack Position. "Recycle Rhinobot"  attacks  "Gagaga Magician", but Yuma activates his  face-down  " Half Unbreak " to target "Gagaga Magician" and prevent it from being  destroyed by battle  as well as halve the  Battle Damage  he takes (Yuma: 4000 → 3400 LP).
 Turn 3: Yuma 
Yuma draws " Gagaga Girl " and subsequently Normal Summons it ( 3/1000/800) in Attack Position. He then activates " Wonder Wand ", equipping it to "Gagaga Girl" and increasing its  ATK  by 500 ("Gagaga Girl": 1000 → 1500 ATK). Yuma then activates the  effect  of "Gagaga Magician", changing its Level to 8 ("Gagaga Magician":   4 → 8). He then activates " Gagaga Thunder " to target "Gagaga Magician" and "Gagaga Girl" and inflict damage to Lillybot equal to the difference in Levels between the targeted monsters times 300 (Lillybot: 4000 → 2500 LP). Yuma Sets a card.
 Turn 4: Lillybot 
Lillybot draws. She then Normal Summons " Junk Robot Teapot Kangaroo " ( 3/800/1200) in Attack Position. Lillybot activates the effect of "Recycle Rhinobot" three times,  detaching  all of its Overlay Units ("Recycle Rhinobot": 3 → 0 ORU) in order to target "Teapot Kangaroo" and increase its ATK by 500 for each one detached ("Teapot Kangaroo": 800 → 1300 → 1800 → 2300 ATK). "Recycle Rhinobot" attacks "Gagaga Girl", but Yuma activates his face-down " Gagagaguard " (as he controls two or more "Gagaga" monsters) to prevent "Gagaga" monsters from being destroyed by battle this turn (Yuma: 3400 → 2200 LP). "Teapot Kangaroo" attacks "Gagaga Magician", but the latter isn't destroyed (Yuma: 2200 → 1400 LP). On Lillybot's  End Phase , the final effect of "Recycle Rhinobot" activates (as it has no Overlay Units),  destroying  "Teapot Kangaroo" (as it had the lowest ATK of all monsters Lillybot had on her field) and inflicting damage to both players equal to its original ATK (Lillybot: 2500 → 1700 LP, Yuma: 1400 → 600 LP).
 Turn 5: Yuma 
Yuma draws " Star Light, Star Bright " and subsequently activates it to target "Gagaga Magician" and "Gagaga Girl" and change the Level of "Gagaga Girl" to that of "Gagaga Magician" (as they have the same ATK) ("Gagaga Girl":   3 → 4). He then overlays "Gagaga Magician" and "Gagaga Girl" in order to Xyz Summon " Number 39: Utopia " ( 4/2500/2000, ORU: 2) in Attack Position. As "Gagaga Girl" was used in an Xyz Summon with another "Gagaga" monster, Yuma activates the effect of "Gagaga Girl" to reduce the ATK of "Recycle Rhinobot" to 0 ("Recycle Rhinobot": 2700 → 0 LP). "Utopia" attacks and destroys "Recycle Rhinobot" (Lillybot: 1700 → 0 LP).
 
 Differences in adaptations 
 Sakiyomi JumBANG! appearing in the World Duel Carnival ad are removed. 
 The revealed electrical wires on the cord Yuma tried to connect on Lillybot is removed. 
 The close-up of "Gagaga Girl" being summoned and being equipped with Wonder Wand are cut. Also cut from the dub is "Gagaga Girl" referring to "Gagaga Magician" as "Gagaga-senpai". 
 "Gagaga Girl" is given more clothing. 
 Mistakes 
 When  Lillybot  won the duel against  Yuma  for the first time, her WIN screen shows her with her pink ribbon attached, although she had only worn the ribbon moments after. This was corrected in the English dub. 
 When Lillybot attacked Yuma with " Wind-Up Zenmaister ", "Zenmaister" remained with 1900 ATK Points. However, due to its effect, it should have increased to 2500. 
 In the Italian dub, " Wind-Up Zenmaister " is called " Wind-Up Zenmaines ". 
 After Yuma's second turn during his second duel with Lillybot, Astral mentions that if Yuma had activated the level-changing effect of "Gagaga Magician" to change it to a Level 3 monster, he could have summoned " Number 17: Leviathan Dragon " and used the effect of "Gagaga Girl" to make the ATK of "Recycle Rhinobot" 0. Astral states that if Yuma did this, he could have won the Duel on that very turn. However, this is untrue - Lillybot still had 4000 LP, so even if Yuma used the effect of "Leviathan Dragon" to increase its ATK to 2500, Lillybot would still have 1500 LP left. 
 Warning the Cards in the Duel Puzzle are so fast to figure out how the puzzle is solve.
