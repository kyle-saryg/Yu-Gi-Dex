 Biography 
 The man formerly worked as an assassin. None of his targets were still alive, when he was hired by  KaibaCorp . [1] 
 
       The assassin in the Stardust Shootout.     
 He was hired for the  Death-T  theme park at  Kaiba Land , which was created to kill Yugi Mutou. The assassin was put on a team with  Johnny Gayle  and  Bob McGuire  to face Yugi and his friends in the first stage of Death-T. Each of them were promised a bounty of ¥10,000 for each opposing player they killed. The assassin planned to kill all three, so he could claim the three bounties for himself. [1] 
 Seto Kaiba  rigged the game so that the three men on his team had real lasers that cause fatal electric shocks when fired, while Yugi and his friends were given toy guns. [1] 
 Gayle moved out first, saying that they should leave it to him, as he was an expert in guerrilla warfare, but  Jonouchi  took out Gayle by kicking him in the face, after running along the tops of the walls. Seeing this, the assassin and McGuire started shooting at Jonouchi. [2] 
 Once  Honda  realized his team's guns did not work, he called his team back for a timeout. Honda returned by himself afterwards, dropping his gun and offering to surrender. However the assassin laughed that was no use, with the bounty for killing Honda in mind.  Johji , who was hiding on Honda's back, tossed him  Anzu Mazaki 's operational gun, which Honda used to take out the assassin and McGuire. Since Honda had previously set the laser to a non-lethal voltage, the assassin and McGuire were not killed. [2] 
 
 Other appearances 
 Snipes Crosshair ( Dungeon Dice Monsters ) 
 In the  Toei  Yu-Gi-Oh!  anime , "name unknown" is replaced with  Blue .
 He bares a striking resemblance to  Nezbitt , who also worked for Seto Kaiba.
