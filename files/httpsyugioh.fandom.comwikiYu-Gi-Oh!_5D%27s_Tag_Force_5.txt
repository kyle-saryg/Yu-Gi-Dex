 Features 
 Rules 
 The game uses the  Yu-Gi-Oh! Official Card Game   Master Rules . Unlike the real game, it includes many cards that have appeared in the anime, that haven't been released in real life, the  Dark Synchro Monsters  and  Egyptian Gods  effects and rules are closer to their anime than real life counterparts.
 The game follows the  March 2010 Forbidden and Limited Lists  by default.
 
 System 
 A data install function is used to eliminate load times.
 Previous cinematics from Tag Force 4 are kept. New cinematic Summoning and attack sequences have been added for " Black-Winged Dragon ", " Majestic Red Dragon ", " Majestic Star Dragon ", " Tech Genus Blade Blaster ", " Chevalier de Fleur ", " Machine Emperor Skiel Infinity ", " Machine Emperor Wisel Infinity ", " Machine Emperor Grannel Infinity ", " Infernity Doom Dragon "," Dragon Knight Draco-Equiste ", " Red Nova Dragon ", and " Shooting Star Dragon ". (Note: the  Machine Emperors  sequences only appear when they are on the field, as summoned by their "Core" monsters.)
The game's loading screen features  Witch of the Black Rose  in different poses, though on rare occasion  Kuribon  can show up instead.
 Connectivity with the  Playstation Network  is supported.
 The  Destiny Draw  system is retained.
 Players can have up to 200 different Decks and may import ones created in  Yu-Gi-Oh! 5D's Tag Force 4 .
 There is a new minigame which involves picking out one card from about half a dozen choices that will form the required Synchro with the card already displayed.
 Also, the  Duel Statue  makes an appearance outside of the cardshop. The statue is charged when you receive duplicates of a card you have already reached the limit on (which is now 9 instead of 99). When fully charged (signified by the glowing ambiance it gets), it gives you an extra copy of a card you have that you pick.
 
 UMD recognition 
 By using game's  UMD Recognition  feature with the previous  Tag Force  games the following can be unlocked:
 
 Yu-Gi-Oh! GX Tag Force  unlocks  Yusei Fudo  (poncho version) as an opponent, along with the following cards " Dark Magician ", " Slifer the Sky Dragon ", " Malefic Truth Dragon ", and " Philosopher's Stone - Sabatiel ". 
 Yu-Gi-Oh! GX Tag Force 2  unlocks  Akiza Izinski  (Academy version) as an opponent, along with the following cards " The Winged Dragon of Ra ", " Power Wall ", " Red-Eyes B. Dragon ", and " Malefic Red-Eyes Black Dragon ". 
 Yu-Gi-Oh! GX Tag Force 3  unlocks  Luna  (Academy version) as an opponent, along with the following cards " Blue-Eyes White Dragon ", " Malefic Blue-Eyes White Dragon ", " Obelisk the Tormentor ", and " Miracle Contact ". 
 Yu-Gi-Oh! 5D's Tag Force 4  unlocks  Leo  (Academy version) as an opponent, along with the following cards " Malefic Stardust Dragon ", " Hundred-Eyes Dragon  ( Dark Synchro  version), " Dark Magician Girl ", and " Cursed Prison ". 
 Passing all 4 previous  Tag Force  games through UMD Recognition unlocks the cards " Gatling Ogre " and " Berserker Soul ". 
 In the United States, UMD Recognition with the  Tag Force 1 ,  Tag Force 2  and  Tag Force 4  games unlocks the cards mentioned above as well as the alternate storylines of Yusei Fudo (poncho version), Akiza (Duel Academy), Leo (Duel Academy) and Luna (Duel Academy).

 Non-duelist 
 Martha  is able to reset a character's hearts so the  player  can re-view their storyline, or to change them into an alternate character (like poncho-version Yusei), and also allow you to edit your Partner's Deck before you have earned the right to do it by paying 10,000 DP. 
 Blister  is able to give the player information on where main characters are for several days, as well as letting the player put a tracer on a minor duelist character, so he can find them in the city to partner up with them. 
 Rudolph Heitmann  is able to give the player alternate style cards. 
 Stephanie  gives the player a drink at " Cafe la Geen " that sometimes pleases his partner and increases his hearts. She blushes whenever the player visits while partnered with Jack. 
 Zora  will randomly give you something that she found, usually an item or 200 DP, sometimes telling them to use it to help Yusei. 
 The  MC  is randomly hiding in one area on the map, and changes location constantly. If you manage to find him, he can give you a prize of rare cards, a lot of DP, gift items, or increase a partner's Heart meter. 
 Kurumizawa  works in the  shop .

 Bugs 
 While playing against Vizor, If he will Synchro Summon a monster that is not " Tech Genus Wonder Magician " or " Tech Genus Blade Blaster ", He will use the Summon Chant of " Tech Genus Gladiator ", minus declaring the monster's name. This is due to a programming oversight in the game. When characters Synchro Summon a Synchro Monster that doesn't have any ties with them (i.e. Not their monster or hasn't been used by them in the anime), they will use a chant that was mentioned only sparingly in the anime. (Examples include Yusei using the Synchro Chant of " Nitro Warrior " even when it's not " Nitro Warrior ", Aki uses the Synchro Chant of " Splendid Rose ", and Jack uses his version of the Synchro Chant of " Stardust Dragon ".) 
 When you play " Molten Destruction " the 3D field seems to have an error like it did in the previous version of the game. 
 When  Sherry LeBlanc  activates her " Future Fusion " Spell Card, everything resolves as it should be except that a card at random is shown when selecting the Fusion Monster to summon on the following two turns and it either shows " Gungnir, Dragon of the Ice Barrier " or " Chevalier de Fleur ". This also happens for the player. 
 There may be times in which your Extra Deck malfunctions by listing multiple copies of monsters you already have as well as when Synchro Summoning during your turn and checking that the Extra Deck has 15 monsters maxed out already. 
 A programming oversight that occurred during the translation of the game into English and distribution into international circles is that the game follows  OCG  rulings. Therefore, when you have exactly 1000 LP during your end phase, " Red Screen " will take it from you, making you lose the duel.
 Another Programming oversight because of a ruling change. " Dragunity Aklys " will activate regardless of how it was sent to the Graveyard as an equip spell, whether it be by destruction or by game mechanics. In recent rulings, Aklys will only activate when it has been sent to the Graveyard while equipped  while  the monster it is equipped to remains face-up. 
 This is a mistake in the card text of " Liberty at Last! ", just like the International card version. It mentions that the selected monsters are returned to the hand not back to the Deck. However, the real effect is activated and the selected monsters are returned to the Deck. 
 There is a mistake in the card text of " Ancient Flamvell Deity ". The card text says remove form play when it should say  remove from play . 
 There is a mistake in the card text of " Infernal Incinerator " and " Naturia Dragonfly ". The card text says "this card192" after 2000 when it should say "or more ATK." 
 The summon animations for " Wisel ", " Skiel " and " Grannel " will not register in your photo gallery, regardless of whether you have fullfilled the requirements to unlock them. This is because in the Japanese translation, the summon animation was cued when the said card is summoned via their respective cores, whilst in the International release this was moved to when the final piece of the '-el' series is summoned (the  Carrier  monster). Hoewever, the programming was not changed to reflect this and the game does not register you having watched the summon animation. 
 The effect of " Spirit's Invitation " reads: " Each time your Spirit monster returns to your hand, select 1 monster on your opponent's side of the field and return it to its owner's hand. Pay 500 Life Points during each of your Standby Phases. If you do not, destroy this card ." However, when a Spirit returns to your hand, your opponent chooses which card to return to their hand. 
 The effect of " Gigantic Cephalotus " reads: " Each time a plant time monster is sent from the field to the Graveyard, it gains 200 ATK ." But in real life, it actually gets 200 ATK for each plant sent to the Graveyard, regardless if the Plant-Type monster is sent to the Graveyard from your deck or your hand. 
 Sometimes, when you fill a character's Heart, but you continue to positively interact with him/her (in the same day), the next Heart will start to fill (even though you haven't done the event of the previous filled Heart). In the next days, if you try to complete that Heart, it will empty with the first interaction you do with him/her. You have to check it every day until the Game allows you to fill that Heart again. 
 Sometimes, when you don't go straight to the event site of your partner (marked with "!"), and you visit another places and duel with another character's (in the same day), the completed Heart of your partner will vanish, the mark of the event will disappear in the map and the Game will not let you fill that Heart again (regardless of how many positive interactions you do with him/her in the next days via gifts.)  To rectify this, you need to invite that person to the tag team duel tournament.  Winning a minimum of one tag duel in the tournament, will allow you to resume filling that persons heart. 
 When you ask to Martha to change Yusei to Yusei (Poncho Version), but you haven't finished Yusei story, Yusei (Poncho Version) will never appear in the map.  If you saved the Game to this point, you will never complete either Yusei stories. 
 While the player has a " Royal Oppression " face-up and the opponent activates the " Playful Possum " to Special Summon itself, the opponent continuously pays to activate "Royal Oppression" and activates "Playful Possum" until they can no longer pay. 
 When Leo uses the Defense Position effect of " Morphtronic Vacuumen " to use an Attack Position monster you control as an Equip Card for "Morphtronic Vacuumen" and is destroyed later, the monster that was used as an Equip Card won't be destroyed and remains meaninglessly in Leo's Spell/Trap Card Zone. (maybe works for the player too) 
 When the effect of " Dimension Jar " is activated, instead of monsters, both players can banish any card in the Graveyard. 
 " Lancer Dragonute " is misspelled as "Rancer Dragonute". 
 When " Final Countdown " has been activated and is in effect, you may not be able to activate optional card effects that resolve in the End Phase, such as the ability of "Stardust Dragon" to special summon itself from the Graveyard.
