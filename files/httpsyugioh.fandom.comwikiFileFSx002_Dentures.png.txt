 Biography 
 Mokuba Kaiba  bribed Dentures to help set up  Yugi Mutou  to lose a game of  Capsule Monster Chess . They rigged a coin operated  Capsule Monster Chess  dispenser  from outside Dentures' store. [1] 
 When  Mokuba's gang  took the dispenser, for Mokuba to use to play  Capsule Monster Chess  against Yugi, Dentures came out pretending to be mad, yelling at them. Mokuba gave him money for the dispenser, making Dentures leave them. This made it look as though Dentures was not involved, therefore removing suspicion that the machine had been tampered with. Mokuba later said to himself that Dentures was a professional actor when he was young, and had not lost his touch. [1]
