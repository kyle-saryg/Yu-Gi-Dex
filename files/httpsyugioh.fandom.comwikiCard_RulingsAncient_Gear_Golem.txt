 OCG Rulings 
 The " If this card  attacks  a  Defense Position   monster , inflict  piercing   battle damage  to your opponent.  " effect is a  Continuous Effect . [1] 
 The " If this card attacks, your opponent cannot  activate  any  Spell / Trap Cards  until the end of the  Damage Step . " effect is a  Continuous Effect . [1] 
 If " Ancient Gear Golem " is  destroyed by battle , the " your opponent cannot  activate  any  Spell / Trap Cards  until the end of the  Damage Step . " effect is no longer applied. [1] 
 Even if this effect of " Ancient Gear Golem " is being applied, the effects of face-up  Continuous Trap Cards  can still be activated. [1] 
 You can activate " Spell Gear " if you have 1 copy of " Ancient Gear Golem " in either your hand or Deck. You can activate " Spell Gear " if you have 1 copy of " Ancient Gear Golem " in both your hand and Deck. You cannot activate " Spell Gear " if you have no copies of " Ancient Gear Golem " in either your hand and your Deck. [2] 
 " Inferno Reckless Summon " may be activated if your opponent only controls monsters like " Ancient Gear Golem " or " The Wicked Dreadroot " which cannot be Special Summoned. When resolving " Inferno Reckless Summon ", your opponent cannot select a monster that cannot be Special Summoned, so only your monsters will be Special Summoned. [3] 
 The text " cannot activate any Spell/Trap Cards " of " Ancient Gear Golem " means that the opponent cannot activate  Quick-Play Spell Cards  from the hand or Set Spell/Trap Cards. When " Ancient Gear Golem " attacks, your opponent can activate the effect of an " Ultimate Offering " which is already face-up on the field. Also, if " Ancient Gear Golem " attacks and a  Set  " Statue of the Wicked " is destroyed, then its effect will activate. [4] 
 Previously Official Rulings 
   These TCG rulings were issued by  Upper Deck Entertainment  and have since been deemed unofficial by Konami. [5]  They were previously considered official and can still be correct, as long as they follow the official gameplay rules, or unless Konami has issued a ruling that says otherwise. References:  [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] 
 
 If “ Ancient Gear Golem ”  attacks , the effects of  Spell  or  Trap Cards  that are already  face-up  can still have their effects  activated , like “ Ultimate Offering ”, “ Royal Oppression ”, or “ Skull Lair ”. However,  face-down   Spell  or  Trap Cards  cannot be  activated  ( flipped   face-up ), including a  face-down  “ Ultimate Offering ”, etc. 
 The effect of “ Ancient Gear Golem ” that prevents your opponent from  activating   Spell  or  Trap Cards  is a  Continuous Effect . It cannot be  chained  to. “ Divine Wrath ” cannot be  activated  against it. 
 If “ Ancient Gear Golem ”  attacks , and is  destroyed  before the end of the  Damage Step , its effect is no longer applied after it is  destroyed , even if it is still on the  field  and has not yet been sent to the  Graveyard . (A  Continuous Effect  is no longer applied after the  monster  generating it has been  destroyed , even if the  monster  is still on the  field .) The effect of “ Ancient Gear Golem ” is applied up until the point it is  destroyed , though.
