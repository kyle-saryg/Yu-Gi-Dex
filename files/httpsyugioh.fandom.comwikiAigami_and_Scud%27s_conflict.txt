      Scud , filming  Aigami     
 Aigami and Scud's conflict  was a set of encounters between  Aigami  and  Scud's gang , in  Yu-Gi-Oh! The Dark Side of Dimensions .
 Scud and his gang hoped to harass Aigami on film. However Aigami, hoping to purge deplorable people from existance, used it as an opportunity to remove them.
 
 Events 
 Scud  and his gang first approached Aigami under a bridge, in  Domino City . They pushed him against a pillar and Scud approached him with a camera, while making provocative remarks about his cute face. (In the English dub, Scud said that Aigami was to star in his new documentary on bullying.) Aigami made pleas for the stop, which proved fruitless.  Katsuya Jonouchi  then jumped down from the bridge and intervened. Scud decided to drop the matter for the time being, but instructed Aigami to meet the gang at the the abandoned factory in District 3 at midnight. Jonouchi and his friends,  Anzu Mazaki  and  Yugi Mutou  asked if he was okay and Jonouchi offered to help, if Scud's gang were still giving him trouble. Aigami thanked them and insisted he was okay.
 
       The  Prana , surrounding  Scud's gang     
 Per Scud's orders, Aigami met the gang at midnight. The gang brought lights and weapons. Scud continued to film, saying he would make Aigami world famous and that the theme of this video would be pain. (In the dub, he said that this is the part where Aigami cries and not due to an onion.) The gang were surprised to see Aigami laughing too. Aigami asked if he resided in their memories and who they thought was allowing scum like them to exist. (In the dub, he said it was time for them to vanish and that he had the power to change their world into some place grand, where they do not deserve to exist.) He produced the  Quantum Cube  and the bulbs in the lights the gang brought all blew. Numerous children of the  Prana  appeared in spirit form and surrounded the game. Aigami used the cube to make Scud's body disappear. (In the dub, one of the gangsters said that Scud was history, but Aigami disagreed, commenting that history is remembered.) He then made the other members of the gang disappear too.
 The gang's disappearance made the news, alongside mentions of other people mysteriously disappearing worldwide. Yugi and Anzu read about this, recognizing the gang from the first encounter with Aigami.
