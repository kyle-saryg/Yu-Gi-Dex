 This section, or a part of it, has been transcluded from  Yu-Gi-Oh! R - Volume 001 ; any changes involving it should be made  there  instead.  /  
 The shocking sequel to "Yu-Gi-Oh!: Duelist" and prequel to "Yu-Gi-Oh!: Millennium World!" When the follower of an old enemy returns to take revenge, Yugi Mutou must duel to save a friend's life. But can he overcome the power of the three "Jashin," the terrifying Evil God Cards? [1] 
 A World Ruled By Fear! 
 Yugi's battle with Yako Tenma continues, but things are not as they seem! Yako's Evil God Cards are just as strong as Yugi's Egyptian God Cards, and at the height of the duel, they unleash their hidden supernatural power. Meanwhile, Yako reveals the true purpose of his sinister "R.A. Project," and why he needs Anzu's body. Can anyone stop his mad plan? [2]

 Message from Kazuki Takahashi 
 Recently I got a dog… little Taro-kun, a Shiba! It's absolutely unreal how cute he is…! Ah… But I'll be careful that we don't end up barging into It's workspace during our midnight walk and interfering with his manuscript work, or forcing him to play mahjong with me! (I'm sorry. Looking back, I regret what I've done.) [2] 
 
 Message from Akira Ito 
 Back when I was an assistant… I drew this picture one day when Takahashi-sensei told all his assistants to "try drawing Yugi." It look even less like him than the pictures I draw now… but looking back, I guess this was the beginning of "R" [2]

 Story 
 When the tenth grader Yugi solved the ancient Egyptian Millennium Puzzle, another spirit took up residence in his body…Yu-Gi-Oh, the King of Games! Using his gaming skills, Yugi fought many adversaries like Maximillion Pegasus, the multimillionaire creator of the collectible card game Duel Monsters, and Seto Kaiba, the CEO of Kaiba Corporation. After winning the Battle City tournament, Yugi acquired the most powerful cards in the world: the three Egyptian Go Cards, "Slifer the Sky Dragon," "The God of the Obelisk" and "The Sun Dragon Ra", which were created by Pegasus based on a mysterious ancient Egyptian card game. 
 But now a new enemy has appeared. Yako Tenma of Industrial Illusions, Pegasus's company, has made a hostile takeover of Kaiba Corporation and challenged Yugi to a duel. To ensure Yugi's participation, he has kidnapped Yugi's friend Anzu, intending to use her as a "sacrifice" for the "R.A. Project." To rescue Anzu, Yugi and his friends rush to Kaiba Corporation skyscraper. Inside, they are attacked by the "Card Professors," Tenma's henchmen. Now, Yugi faces Tenma and his deadly card, "The Wicked Avatar," in a duel… [2] 
 
 In the Next Volume… 
 Yugi and Jonouchi continue their fight to the top of KaibaCorp! Meanwhile, Kaiba infiltrates the heart of the building and learns the truth of Yako's evil plan. To save Anzu, Yugi must fight Depres, master of the cosmic deck… an army of space aliens and monsters that will annihilate Yugi's mere earthly cards!
