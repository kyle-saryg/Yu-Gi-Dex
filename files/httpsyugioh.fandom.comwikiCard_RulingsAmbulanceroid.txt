 Previously Official Rulings 
   These TCG rulings were issued by  Upper Deck Entertainment  and have since been deemed unofficial by Konami. [4]  They were previously considered official and can still be correct, as long as they follow the official gameplay rules, or unless Konami has issued a ruling that says otherwise.

 You can  Special Summon  “ Dark Jeroid ” with “ Ambulanceroid ’s” effect because it has “roid” in its card name.
