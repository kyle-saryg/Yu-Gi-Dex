 Duelist Kingdom  was a tournament organized by  Maximillion Pegasus , which took place on his  island of the same name . Some of Japan's strongest Duelists were invited to compete for the title "King of Games" and a prize money of ¥3,000,000 (about US$27,959 at the time, but changed to $3,000,000 in the dub and $200,000 in the English manga).  Yugi Muto  entered the tournament with best friend  Joey Wheeler  in tow, Yugi having been forced to participate after Pegasus stole  Solomon Muto 's (Yugi's grandfather) soul in a Shadow Game.

 Structure 
         Invitation cards and  Star Chips .     
 Forty people were invited to participate in the tournament. Each of them were given one  Dueling Gauntlet , two  Star Chips  and the cards " Glory of the King's Hand " and " Glory of the King's Opposite Hand ".
 In the preliminary stage of the tournament, the participants faced each other  battle royal  style for 48 hours. They challenged each other to Duels, wagering Star Chips in the process. Anyone who ran out of Star Chips was eliminated from the tournament; exchanging Star Chips outside of a Duel is a violation, and being caught would result in disqualification. The first four to gain ten Star Chips got to enter the finals.  Eliminators  hired by Pegasus were also able to challenge players to Duels. Since the participants had a total of eighty Star Chips among them, while only forty were needed to get four finalists, the Eliminators' job was to obtain the other forty Star Chips.
 Although Pegasus invited 40 specific participants, there are two known stowaways who participated, which Pegasus did not object to the participation of.
 Noted by Yugi's group, no food or refreshments were offered to the participants during the preliminaries. This was likely to force the contests to Duel faster so they could get to the castle. Though this was also quite cruel since the eliminated were forced to use row boats to get back to the mainland; having to do so on an empty stomach would only make the trip worse due to the lack of strength and being more susceptible to seasickness.
 The finals consisted of single-elimination playoffs. At least one of the cards "Glory of the King's Opposite Hand" or "Glory of the King's Hand" was required to take part in the playoffs.
 The winner of the playoffs advanced to face Pegasus in a Duel for the title "King of Games". "Glory of the King's Opposite Hand" was required to face Pegasus in this Duel. "Glory of the King's Hand" was required to take the cash prize.
 
 Rules

 Events 
 Purpose and planning 
 See also:  Pegasus' KaibaCorp takeover attempt 
 Following the death of  Maximillion Pegasus ' lover  Cecelia , Pegasus became interested in the ancient Egyptian beliefs about life after death and traveled to Egypt to learn more. There he followed  Shadi  to an underground chamber. Since only  Millennium Item  holders were permitted to leave, he was put on trial by the  Millennium Eye , to become its owner. During the test, he was briefly embraced by an illusion of Cecelia. [1] 
 
         Pegasus' deal with  The Big Five .     
 After creating the game  Duel Monsters , Pegasus took interest in  KaibaCorp 's  Solid Vision  technology, which could enhance the game by creating realistic projections of the monsters. He also saw it as a means of creating another lifelike projection of Cecelia. His company Industrial Illusions allied with KaibaCorp to work on using Solid Vision for  Duel Monsters . [2] 
 Pegasus expressed an interest in seizing KaibaCorp and had spies from Industrial Illusions employed by KaibaCorp, including  Kemo . KaibaCorp's good reputation was credited to its president,  Seto Kaiba , being the number one gamer in Japan. However when Kaiba was defeated in a Duel by Yugi Muto and his other self, Yami Yugi, their reputation dropped as investors lost confidence in them. In the manga, Kaiba was also left in a coma due to his  Penalty Game . Pegasus made a secret business deal with KaibaCorp's largest shareholders,  The Big Five , which would result in him becoming CEO of KaibaCorp. As part of the deal Pegasus was required to defeat Yugi Muto in an official Duel to restore KaibaCorp's reputation. Afterwards, Pegasus set up the Duelist Kingdom tournament in order to face Yugi in an official Duel. [2] 
 
 Invitations 
         Pegasus  Duels   Yami Yugi  through the TV.     
 Pegasus sent invitations to forty of Japan's top Duelists, including Yugi. He also sent Yugi  a videotape , which enabled the two of them to  Duel through a TV . He defeated Yugi and stripped the soul of Yugi's grandfather,  Solomon Muto , from his body as Yugi's Penalty Game. Yugi was forced to enter the tournament in order to return his grandfather to normal. [3] [4] [5] 
 Finalists from the  Japanese National Duel Monsters Championship  were invited and were the only participants given their own room on the  boat ride . They included  Rex Raptor  and  Weevil Underwood .
 Other invited Duelists included  Bonz ,  Sid ,  Mako Tsunami ,  Mai Valentine  and  Zygor .
 Joey Wheeler  was not to be invited to the tournament, but he desperately needed the prize money in order to pay for eye surgery for his sister  Serenity , who was in danger of going blind. Yugi gave one of his Star Chips to Joey, allowing him to compete.  Bandit Keith  was not invited either, but he snuck his way into the tournament, hoping to get revenge on Pegasus for an earlier defeat.
 Yugi's friends  Téa Gardner  and  Tristan Taylor  accompanied Yugi and Joey to the tournament to support them.  Bakura Ryou  also came along to support them and learn more about the Millennium Items. In the manga, Bakura was with them the whole time. In the anime, they didn't know he had come until midway through the preliminaries.
 
 Boat ride 
 Main article:  Journey to Duelist Kingdom 
 The boat to the island left from  Domino Pier . [6] [7] 
 In the manga, Yugi's friends weren't shown to have any problem boarding the ship despite not being officially invited. In the anime, Téa and Tristan had to sneak into the cargo hold. Bakura also managed to sneak on. Joey got into a bit of trouble with the officials who saw him boarding without any evidence that he was in the tournament. However Yugi spotted him and gave him one of his Star Chips, entitling him to take part in the tournament. (In the manga, Yugi had already given him one of his Star Chips). [6] [7] 
 Most players had to sleep in the common area, while finalists from the previous tournament got their own rooms. In the anime, Joey took advantage of being in the common area to trade for " Baby Dragon ", " Salamandra ",  Shield & Sword " and " Kunai with Chain ". Mai was unhappy with having to sleep in the common area, so she flirted with Rex to get him to share his room. She then challenged him to  a Duel  to have the room to herself or be slave to Rex's desires. Using her  Aroma Tactics , she easily won. [6] [7] 
 While speaking with Yugi on the Deck, Weevil asked to see Yugi's " Exodia " cards and proceeded to throw them overboard. Joey tried diving into the water to retrieve them, but only managed to get back two of them before being rescued. [6] [7] 
 After arriving, participants had any extra cards confiscated so that they each only had 40 cards. [ citation needed ] 
 
 Preliminaries 
 In order to get revenge on Weevil for throwing the "Exodia" cards overboard,  Yami Yugi  challenged him to the  first Duel  of the tournament. Since he vowed to eliminate Weevil, but only had one Star Chip to bet, he also bet his life for Weevil's second Star Chip (In the anime, he bet his Deck rather than his life). Yami Yugi proceeded to win and obtained Weevil's title as the Japanese National Champion. Since Weevil was eliminated, Joey also took his  Dueling Gauntlet . [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] 
 Mai defeated  an opponent  using her Aroma Tactics. Afterwards she challenged Joey to  a Duel  after considering it unwise to challenge Yugi this soon. Joey struggled at first, but figured out Mai's Aroma Tactics strategy and managed to beat her, winning one Star Chip. [14] [15] [16] 
 Yugi and his friends were lured to  Mako Tsunami 's territory after being attracted by the smell of his food. After sharing a meal, Mako challenged Yugi to  a Duel , where he had home advantage on the  Ocean  terrain. Yami managed to win the Duel, winning two more Star Chips. [17] [18] [19] 
 Yugi and his friends saw  a Duelist  being disqualified for running out of Star Chips, despite his insistence that they had been stolen. Yugi and Joey offered to help find the thief and return his Star Chips. The thief turned out to be  Mokuba Kaiba , who had escaped Pegasus' captivity and was  trying to eliminate  Yugi from the tournament, so that Pegasus would not get to defeat him. However Mokuba was unable to beat Yugi and attempted to steal his Star Chips, grabbing two of them. After Yugi convinced Mokuba that he would help Kaiba, Mokuba tried giving Yugi his Star Chips, but Kemo forbid it, as Star Chips could only be own through Dueling. In the anime, Kemo slapped the Star Chips into the water. [20] [21]  Kemo then arranged an opponent for Yugi.
 In the manga, Yugi's arranged opponent was the Player Killer ( Eliminator ) called  Ventriloquist of the Dead  and they each bet three Star Chips. The ventriloquist used a  puppet of Seto Kaiba  to hold and play his cards. He used the real Kaiba's Deck, which Pegasus' men had stolen and had the puppet claim to be the real Kaiba borrowing the body of a doll to get revenge on Yugi. During the Duel, one of the " Blue-Eyes White Dragon " cards played by the ventriloquist destroyed itself as the real Kaiba awoke from his coma. From that point, the ventriloquist Dueled without using the puppet. When Yugi won, he inflicted a Penalty Game on the ventriloquist, making him believe the puppet was taunting him, while now looking like the ventriloquist. [2] [22] [23] 
 In the anime, Yugi's arranged opponent was the Eliminator  Ghost Kaiba  and they each bet three Star Chips. Ghost Kaiba pretended to be Kaiba at first. He also used Kaiba's Deck, which Pegasus' men had stolen. The real Kaiba hacked into Pegasus' computer system during the Duel and infected one of the "Blue-Eyes White Dragon" cards with a virus, causing it to weaken and destroy itself. [24] [25]  See  Yami Yugi and Ghost Kaiba's Duel  for more details.
 At some point, Mai defeated more opponents, upping her Star Chip count to eight. Rex Raptor, who was still mad at her over the Duel they had on the boat ride, tried challenging her to a rematch, but Mai was not interested in Dueling him a second time. However Mai wanted to make-up for losing to Joey earlier, but thought it shallow to challenge Joey to another Duel, so she accepted Rex's challenge under the condition that he defeat Joey first. This way if Rex won and she defeated Rex, it would be like beating both of them.
 Joey and Rex bet two Star Chips on  their Duel . Towards the end of the Duel, they played their ace cards " Time Wizard " and " Red-Eyes Black Dragon ", which they also put on  ante . "Time Wizard" succeeded in aging "Red-Eyes Black Dragon" winning the Duel for Joey.

           Yugi vs. Kaiba on top of Duelist Kingdom Castle     
 Episodes  022 - 024 
 
 Kaiba confronts Yugi on the top of the castle, explaining his situation to him. He also wants a rematch after losing the first Duel they played. Yugi accepts the challenge, and they each wager 5 Star Chips so that only one of them will be allowed entry into the Castle. During  this Duel , Kaiba merges his three "Blue-Eyes White Dragons" to create " Blue-Eyes Ultimate Dragon ". However, his combo is destroyed with an impenetrable wall of " Kuriboh ", " Mammoth Graveyard ", " Living Arrow ", and " Polymerization ". Kaiba threatens he'll jump off the tower if he should lose (in the dub, Kaiba says the attack of Yugi's monster might knock him off the edge), so for fear seeing Kaiba hurt Yugi overcomes his other self (Yami) and surrenders the Duel.  KAIBA'S TOTAL: 10, YUGI'S TOTAL: 5 . 
 Yugi is so shaken up by this experience that he breaks down in tears, vowing never to Duel again. He fears his other self could cause someone serious harm. 
 Episode  025 
 
 In the anime, to get Yugi back into the finals,  Téa  decides to  Duel   Mai Valentine  (who has 16 Star Chips). Initially, Mai offers her 6 surplus Star Chips in order to repay Yugi back for his Duel with  PaniK  but Yugi, who is still shaken up, refuses. Although Mai could have beaten Téa with the card " Harpie's Feather Duster ", she instead forfeits in order to help Yugi (without admitting it). Inspired by Téa's dedication, Yugi receives the boost he needs to galvanize himself for the finals.  YUGI'S TOTAL: 10 .
 In the manga, Mai simply gives the star chips to Yugi, rather than Dueling Téa for them.

 Seto Kaiba vs. Maximillion Pegasus  (non-tournament) 
 Episodes  026 - 027 
 
 Before the finals,  Pegasus  introduces  Kaiba  to the finalists and the two  Duel . If Pegasus wins, he will take Kaiba's soul; if Kaiba wins,  Mokuba 's soul will be restored. 
 Kaiba's  monsters  are far stronger but Pegasus can see his opponent's cards and predict his strategies using the  Millennium Eye . 
 Pegasus uses  Continuous Spell Card  " Toon World ", which transforms all his monsters into toons which cannot be destroyed. Kaiba attempts to use the " Crush Card " combo that he used against  Yugi  but Pegasus reads his mind and prevents the strategy from working. 
 In the end, Pegasus uses " Doppleganger " to copy Kaiba's "Crush Card" and wins the Duel. 
 After his victory, Pegasus uses his Millennium Eye to steal Kaiba's soul. Seeing this and knowing it has happened because Kaiba was trying to save his little brother, Yugi starts to cry and demands to know why Pegasus is toying with people. 
 Seconds later, Yugi's  Millennium Puzzle  activates and Yugi's " other self " emerges for the first time since his Duel with Kaiba which nearly ended in tragedy. Yami Yugi vows to defeat Pegasus once and for all but he will first have to get through the remaining rounds of the tournament. 
 Semi-final #1:  Mai Valentine vs. Yugi Muto 
 Episodes  029 - 030 
 
 In the dub,  Yugi  tries to hold back  Yami Yugi 's Dueling strength because of his willingness to beat Kaiba even if it meant his death. However, in the manga and Japanese version of the anime, Yami Yugi is concentrating on the coming Duel with Pegasus and not on the Duel with Mai. 
 In both cases this leads to Yugi making mistakes during the Duel. Because of these mistakes, Mai gets a huge advantage, with her " Harpie Lady Sisters " and " Harpie's Pet Dragon " (2000  ATK  and an additional 300 for each  Harpie  on the field) while Yugi fields only "Kuriboh", " Gaia The Fierce Knight ", and " Swords of Revealing Light ". On the last turn however, Yugi gets " Black Luster Ritual " to Summon " Black Luster Soldier " and destroys Mai's "Harpie's Pet Dragon". Being down on morale and seeing she has no monsters to counter, Mai forfeits the Duel. 
 Semi-final #2:  Joey Wheeler vs. Bandit Keith 
 Episodes  031 - 032 
 
           Bandit Keith  is about to be attacked by Joey's " Red-Eyes Black Metal Dragon ".     
 Bandit Keith  steals  Joey 's Playoff Entry card, nearly causing Joey to be disqualified. However, Mai gives Joey her entry card, allowing him to participate. 
 Keith uses  Machine  cards, which are very powerful. Joey uses his  Trap Cards  to hold off the machines, and then copies Keith's " Magic Metal Force " to make his " Red-Eyes Black Dragon " a machine itself with an added 400  ATK . Furthermore, Joey uses " Dragon Nails " to power up his Red-Eyes even more to avoid being destroyed by Keith's " Blast Sphere ". 
 Keith uses " Slot Machine ", but cheats by putting two  Spell Cards  up his sleeve, each being able to power up "Slot Machine" by 700. 
 On the last turn, Keith destroys Joey's dragon and attacks it with "Slot Machine", but Joey activates " Graverobber " to grab Keith's " Time Machine ", returning his monster to the way it was a turn before. Joey attacks "Slot Machine" and wins the Duel. 
 Pegasus then confronts Keith and says that he saw his cheating, whereupon Keith tries to get the prize money by force. In the anime, Pegasus drops Keith down a trap door, and Keith eventually reappears prior to Battle City under the mind control of Marik Ishtar. In the manga, Pegasus inflicts a penalty game on Keith, causing his apparent death. 
 Final:  Joey Wheeler vs. Yugi Muto 
 Episodes  033 - 034 
 
 Last, is the match to determine who will Duel Pegasus. This Duel exists only in the anime. In the manga, Pegasus instantly declared Yugi the winner. 
 The Duel turns out a rather even battle, with  Joey  seemingly gaining a good lead about mid-way through. He copies Yugi's " Summoned Skull " and fuses it with " Red-Eyes Black Dragon " to create " Black Skull Dragon ". 
 However, Yugi destroys it with the combo " Dark Magician ", " Spellbinding Circle ", and " Book of Secret Arts ", and ultimately Joey's lead is completely lost due to a miscalculation on his part. As he plays the " Time Wizard "-" Baby Dragon " combo to Summon " Thousand Dragon ", his Time Wizard's magic turns Yugi's "Dark Magician" into " Dark Sage ", which allows Yugi to play a  Spell Card  every turn (even during an opponent's turn and even if the Spell Card is not set). 
 Exploiting this, Yugi activates " Makiu, the Magical Mist " to counter Joey's attack, then plays " Monster Reborn " to bring back Joey's " Black Skull Dragon ". After telling Joey this move is the toughest he is about to make, Yugi orders his monster to attack him and wins the Duel. 
 Yugi vs. Pegasus : Match of the Millennium 
 Episodes  035 - 039 
 
 Pegasus applies the same strategy to Yugi as he did to Kaiba. He's able to play " Toon World ", making all his monsters invincible. Pegasus sees every one of Yugi's strategies, and counters every one of them. However, Yugi then uses mind shuffle. Yugi and Dark Yugi keep changing places, and Pegasus cannot see the mind of the other. Therefore, he does not know what Yugi plans. 
 In the dub, Pegasus then sends the Duel into the Shadow Realm, where his illusion monsters come into play. In the manga and Japanese anime, Pegasus does not use the Shadow Realm as the Shadow Realm does not exist in either of those versions. In either version, the Duel still turns into a shadow game where Summoning monsters creates a massive strain on the Duelist's mind if they don't have the strength. Dark Yugi had the strength to work through it, but Yugi didn't, which Pegasus knew, resulting in his near death. 
 Yugi's friends are able to block Pegasus from reading Dark Yugi's mind, so his plan to be able to read his mind still doesn't work. Ultimately, Yugi wins. 
 
 
 Aftermath 
 Episode  040 
In the end of it all, Pegasus's  Millennium Eye  gets stolen by Dark Bakura, and the souls of Mokuba Kaiba, Seto Kaiba and Solomon Muto are restored. Yugi gives Joey the money for Serenity's eye surgery.
