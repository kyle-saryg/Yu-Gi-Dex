 Design 
 Appearance 
       Chumley's design incorporates multiple layers of clothing and a wide range of expressions. Depicted here is the  Duelist  in full  Slifer Red  regalia from front, side, and rear alongside views of his head from different angles.     
 Chumley's character design was overseen by  Kenichi Hara . His usual outfit consists of the standard  Slifer Red  uniform, though its colors are inverted to include a larger section of white than red. His face, build, and hairstyle were made to resemble a koala. As conceived, the character was very muscular, but his muscle tone is removed from the dub to make him appear obese. He carries a Duel Academy-issued Duel Disk on his left hand.
 
 Personality 
 Chumley is portrayed as a lazy and gluttonous Duelist who could never win a Duel and hated exercising. Though a loyal friend, he was never really into putting himself in any danger, being a very reluctant participant. However, he would prefer his friends over any amount of grilled cheeses. He eventually turns from a lazy flunky to a respected card designer working with Maximillion Pegasus. 
 
 Voice/Mannerisms 
         Full-body shot of Chumley.     
 In the Japanese version, he ends mostly of his sentences with "da-na". Instead of saying "turn end", he says "I guess I have ended my turn", showing insecurity.  [4] 
In the dub, Chumley is obsessed with grilled cheese sandwiches. It is said at one point he creates a Grilled Cheese  Spell Card . His obsession with the food leads him to use phrases such as "lischus" and "not lischus" as positive and negative assurance respectively, the words being derived from "delicious." In one episode of the dub, it is implied that he speaks French.
 
 Abilities 
 Chumley has the same power to hear and see Duel Spirits that  Chazz Princeton  and  Jaden Yuki  have, although he is not totally aware of it. His  Spirit Partner  is " Des Koala " and he is pictured with it several times.
 
 Biography 
 Chumley was forced to retake his freshman year after he failed his first time around. His best friends,  Jaden Yuki  and  Syrus Truesdale , come to  Duel Academy , and encourage Chumley to gain more confidence in himself.
 He watches Jaden duel Chazz and becomes thrilled when he won and later joins him and Syrus to investigate  the  Abandoned Dorm . He then watches Jaden take on and beat  Titan , saving  Alexis Rhodes .
 Later Chumley watches Jaden and Syrus  Duel  and beat the  Paradox Brothers . He gets happy knowing his roommates won't be leaving.
 Throughout the series, Chumley participates in only two Duels: the first against his father,  Mr. Huffington [3] , and the second against  Dr. Crowler . [5]  His father believed that his son's efforts at Duel Academy were wasted and that he would be better off leaving to work at his father's sake business (hot sauce business in the dub). To put an end to the conflict, Chumley struggled valiantly against his father's special tactics, but ultimately lost. Despite this, he allowed his son to continue his studies, as he saw that Chumley had actually learned something, and that his friends would always support him. [3] 
 
       Chumley leaving Duel Academy     
 Maximillion Pegasus  offers Chumley a job at  Industrial Illusions  as a card designer nearing the end of the first year after he wins a card-design contest by creating " Ayers Rock Sunrise ". In order to determine whether or not he will be permitted to leave the school, Crowler Duels with him in one final test. Although Chumley manages to hold his own, even getting the chance to play the first card of his own creation, "Ayers Rock Sunrise", he is again defeated. Crowler, however, lets him move on regardless, impressed by how far in his studies he has come. [5] 
 
         Chumley and Pegasus     
 Chumley returns with Pegasus during the  Genex Tournament  to give Jaden a new card, " Skyscraper 2 - Hero City ", to aid him in his Duel with  Franz , a fellow card designer who stole the only remaining copy of " The Winged Dragon of Ra " from Industrial Illusions. [6] 
 Chumley, along with  Belowski , is shown during  Honest 's flashback of  Professor Banner 's class in  episode 176 . [7] 
 
 Deck 
 Chumley uses an  Australian Deck [3] , sporting cards such as " Des Koala ", " Des Kangaroo ", and " Eucalyptus Mole ", all of which reflect his affinity toward such animals, including his favorite card, " Big Koala ". His strongest monster, " Master of Oz ", and one of its fusion components, the aforementioned "Des Kangaroo", were given to him by his best friends  Jaden Yuki  and  Syrus Truesdale  respectively.
