 Events 
 Seto Kaiba  receives a call from  Maximillion Pegasus , who has apparently managed to buy up the majority of KaibaCorp's shares. Pegasus holds the company ransom to convince Kaiba to come to Duelist Kingdom and Duel him.
 Kaiba accepts, but  Mokuba  realizes this is a conflicted decision, as his brother had vowed not to Duel until he had completed their latest project: the "Worldwide Kaiba Land Project". 
 Once they meet, Pegasus greets both of them. Kaiba questions if the incidents were due to him, and he plays the innocent. Their Duel begins, although Kaiba is picked by a phrase Pegasus mutters just before their Duel begins: "I've been waiting a long time for this day". Pegasus still favors Toon Monsters. 
 Kaiba counts on the might of his Blue-Eyes White Dragon to bring him a victory, and with a few determined draws, he manages to destroy the Toon Combo. 
 When he confronts Pegasus, telling him that the Pegasus he knew wouldn't have been bested so easily, "Pegasus" admits not being the real one and removes a mask. Kaiba's opponent is in fact a man named  Alister , who wields a new  Duel Disk  from this point onward and one of the 3 Swordsmen of  Doma . 
 Alister activates " The Seal of Orichalcos ", trapping both Duelists and determining that the loser of the Duel also loses his "soul". 
 In the meantime,  Weevil Underwood  and  Rex Raptor , who were hidden in the extra luggage, accidentally fall out of the transport van and got themselves lost into the downtown districts of San Francisco. 
 Yugi and the rest travel through San Francisco and head to Industrial Illusions HQ. 
 Notes 
 Also, in the English dub, after Kaiba destroys Toon World, he accuses Pegasus of using practically the same moves card for card as he used in their last Duel. Kaiba and Pegasus have only Dueled twice — once starting in  episode 26  and again in  the Pyramid of Light movie . Each duel had a few cards in common with this one, but the combos differed significantly. (In the Japanese version, Kaiba tells him that he always memorizes his Duels and that he knew a way to destroy the Toon Combo.) 
 Featured Duel: Seto Kaiba vs. Pegasus 
 Turn 1: Pegasus 
Pegasus draws. He then  Normal Summons  " Toon Alligator " (800/1600) in  Defense Position  and  Sets  a Card.
 Turn 2: Kaiba 
Kaiba draws " Spear Dragon " and subsequently Normal Summons it (1900/0) in Attack Position. "Spear Dragon" attacks and destroys "Toon Alligator". "Spear Dragon" then inflicts piercing damage to  Pegasus  ( Pegasus  4000 → 3700). Since "Spear Dragon" attacked, its second effect activates, switching it to Defense Position at the end of the  Damage Step . Kaiba  Sets  two Cards.
 Turn 3: Pegasus 
Pegasus draws " Toon Table of Contents " and subsequently activates it to add " Toon World " from his  Deck  to his  hand . Pegasus then  pays  1000 Life Points ( Pegasus  3700 → 2700) in order to activate "Toon World". Pegasus then  Normal Summons  " Toon Masked Sorcerer " (900/1400) in Attack Position.  Seto  then activates his face-down " Cloning " to Special Summon a " Clone Token " with the same stats as "Toon Masked Sorcerer" (900/1400) in Attack Position. Since both players control a "Toon" monster, neither player can attack directly with their "Toon Masked Sorcerer." Seto explains to Pegasus that if either "Toon Masked Sorcerer" or the Token is destroyed, the other is destroyed with it.
 Turn 4: Kaiba 
Kaiba draws "Blue-Eyes White Dragon". He then  Tributes  "Clone Token" and "Spear Dragon" in order to  Tribute Summon  " Blue-Eyes White Dragon " (3000/2500) in Attack Position.  Pegasus  then  activates  his face-down " Toon Mask " to Tribute " Toon Masked Sorcerer " and  Special Summon  " Blue-Eyes Toon Dragon " (3000/2500) from his Deck in Attack Position. Kaiba then activates " Shrink " to halve the ATK of "Blue-Eyes Toon Dragon" ("Blue-Eyes Toon Dragon": 3000 → 1500/2500). 
 Kaiba then activates " Charm of Lamentation ". Now as long as this card is face-up, Kaiba can draw a card whenever one of his monsters fails to destroy one of Pegasus' monsters by battle. "Blue-Eyes White Dragon"  attacks  "Blue-Eyes Toon Dragon", but "Blue-Eyes Toon Dragon" dodges the attack. The effect of "Charm of Lamentation" activates, letting Seto to  draw  a card. On the End Phase, the effect of "Shrink" expires ("Blue-Eyes Toon Dragon": 1500 → 3000/2500).
 Turn 5: Pegasus 
Pegasus draws. He then  pays  500 Life Points ( Pegasus  2700 → 2200) in order to allow "Blue-Eyes Toon Dragon" to attack. "Blue-Eyes Toon Dragon" attacks  directly  via its own effect, but Seto  activates  his face-down " Negate Attack " to negate the attack and end the Battle Phase. Pegasus then activates " Toon Rollback " in order to conduct his Battle Phase again this turn. He then  Tributes  "Blue-Eyes Toon Dragon" in order to  Tribute Summon  " Toon Dark Magician Girl " (2000/1700) in Attack Position. "Toon Dark Magician Girl" attacks directly via its own effect ( Seto  4000 → 2000).
 Turn 6: Kaiba 
Kaiba draws. "Blue-Eyes White Dragon" attacks "Toon Dark Magician Girl", but "Toon Dark Magician Girl" dodges the attack. The effect of "Charm of Lamentation" activates, letting Seto  draw  a card ("A Wingbeat of Giant Dragon"). Kaiba then activates " A Wingbeat of Giant Dragon " to  return  "Blue-Eyes White Dragon" to his  Hand  and  destroy  all  Magic  and  Trap  Cards on the field. Since "Toon World" is no longer on the  Field , "Toon Dark Magician Girl" is  destroyed . Kaiba then  Normal Summons  " Versago the Destroyer " (1100/900) in  Defense Position .
 Turn 7: Alister 
At this point,  Alister  drops his  Pegasus  disguise and reveals himself; switching his cards from the Duel Stadium playmat to his Duel Disk. Alister draws " The Seal of Orichalcos " and subsequently activates it. 
 Duel concludes next episode.
