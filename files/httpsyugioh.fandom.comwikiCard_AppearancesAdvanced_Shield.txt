 In  episode 170 ,  Valon  uses this card during his duel against  Joey Wheeler . He summons this card via " Full Armor Gravitation ". This card then gained 500 ATK due to " The Seal of Orichalcos ". Later " Rocket Warrior " attacks " Over Boost ", but Valon uses this card's effect to redirect the attack to this card. Since "Rocket Warrior" can't be destroyed in battle when it attacks, only this card was destroyed.
