 Biography 
 Dimensional World Arc 
       Marcel's design incorporates multiple layers of clothing and a wide range of expressions. Depicted here is the  Duelist  from front, side, and rear alongside views of his head from different angles.     
 Marcel is Vice-Chancellor  Jean-Louis Bonaparte 's son, raised by the man's ex-wife, Joséphine. He grew depressed by the sight of his parents bickering and later his father leaving their home in Paris at a young age. He is first seen during the third season, a Ra Yellow student who is friends with  Blair Flannigan . He is shown with her during the party  Adrian  threw at the  Obelisk Blue  dorm and  Duels  her though they both get injured afterword's. After being transported an alternate Sand Dimension, Marcel is targeted as a host and subsequently possessed by  Yubel's , the mysterious demon that  Thelonious Viper  was helping, due to the strong darkness in his heart in part from his parents split when he was younger. Under Yubels control, he then turns many students and faculty members into  Duel Ghouls  and plans to unleash the  Sacred Beasts  before declaring himself king of his newly-instituted empire. 
 During the Duel with  Jaden Yuki  and  Jesse Anderson , Marcel is set free from the creature's influence when Yubel regains physical form. After Duel Academy is restored to its proper place, Marcel recuperates but not before being checked on by Blair while Bonaparte apologizes for making him depressed in the first place but Marcel forgives his father. Marcel is seen again prior to when the Duel Academy students go to see if everybody made it back from the  alternate dimension .
 He leaves the academy in the beginning of the fourth season, to spend more time with his father.
 
 Voice/Mannerisms 
 Marcel speaks in a French accent in the English dub, except for when he is possessed by Yubel. When he speaks without his accent, it is actually  Yubel  speaking through him. This incarnate of her is akin to a split personality for Marcel, as it refers to itself as "your best friend" when consoling Marcel when he thought he had no friends. In the original version, Yubel used her own voice when she possessed Marcel more often.
 
 Decks 
 Anime 
 Marcel plays two Decks while possessed by  Yubel . The first is an  Exodia  Deck . By using cards such as " Mad Reloader " and " Break the Seal ", he is able to quickly gather the individual pieces of Exodia and declare an automatic victory. The second Deck is a  Sacred Beast Deck . He boosts the Summoning speed of the "Sacred Beasts": and also supports the Summoning of their combined form, " Chaos Phantasm Armityle ". He was never seen dueling on-screen without being possessed so his real deck is unknown.
