 Lyrics 
 Kanji Romaji English 
 
 今まぶた閉じたら　傍に感じる 
キミがくれた言葉　悔し涙も 
流れ流れまた季節は過ぎて 
くり返す… 
 
泣きたい時は　ほら　泣いていいよ 
ためらう事なんて　しなくていいよ 
哀しみ晴れるまで　ここに居るから 
キミの味方で居るから 
 
光の差す未来へ 
そこに何があるか解らないけれど 
何も怖がることは無いから 
迷わずに　さぁ　行こう 
 
Forever my friend ずっとずっと 
願ってる　キミの笑顔　輝く様に 
いつまでも　いつも　いつの日も 
一人じゃない　どんな時も 
同じ歌　今も響く　繋いでる 
約束のメロディー 
Oh you're my best Friend 
 
幸せになる為　人は生まれて 
幸せにする為　強さ覚える 
誰も一人では生きて行けない 
弱さを噛みしめながら 
 
凍えた　手を重ねて 
あの日失くした夢の欠片集めよう 
めぐり合いは不思議な奇跡　幸せ奏でよう 
 
Forever my friend ずっとずっと 
変わらない　たとえ別の　道を選び 
離れても　また巡り合える 
一人じゃない　いつもいつも 
同じ空の下　想う　感じてる 
きっと　大丈夫 
 
Forever my friend ずっとずっと 
願ってる　キミの笑顔　輝く様に 
いつまでも　いつも　いつの日も 
一人じゃない　どんな時も 
同じ歌　今も響く　繋いでる 
約束のメロディー 
溢れだすメロディー 
Oh you're my best Friend
 
 
 
 Ima mabuta tojitara soba ni kanjiru 
Kimi ga kureta kotoba kuyashi namida mo 
Nagare nagare mata kisetsu wa sugite 
Kuri kaesu... 
 
Nakitai toki wa hora naite ii yo 
Tamerau koto nante shinakute ii yo 
Kanashimi hareru made koko ni iru kara 
Kimi no mikata de iru kara 
 
Hikari no sasu mirai e 
Soko ni nani ga aru ka wakaranai keredo 
Nani mo kowagaru koto wa nai kara 
Mayowazu ni sā yukou 
 
Forever my friend zutto zutto 
Negatteru kimi no egao kagayaku yō ni 
Itsu made mo itsumo itsu no hi mo 
Hitori janai don'na toki mo 
Onaji uta ima mo hibiku tsunaideru 
Yakusoku no melody 
Oh you're my best friend 
 
Shiawase ni naru tame hito wa umarete 
Shiawase ni suru tame tsuyosa oboeru 
Dare mo hitori dewa ikite yukenai 
Yowasa o kamishime nagara 
 
Kogoeta te o kasanete 
Ano hi na kushita yume no kakera atsumeyou 
Meguri ai wa fushigina kiseki shiawase kanadeyou 
 
Forever my friend zutto zutto 
Kawaranai tatoe betsu no michi o erabi 
Hanarete mo mata meguri aeru 
Hitori janai itsumo itsumo 
Onaji sora no shita omou kanjiteru 
Kitto daijōbu 
 
Forever my friend zutto zutto 
Negatteru kimi no egao kagayaku yō ni 
Itsu made mo itsumo itsu no hi mo 
Hitori janai don'na toki mo 
Onaji uta ima mo hibiku tsunaideru 
Yakusoku no melody 
Afure dasu melody 
Oh you're my best friend
 
 
 
 Now if I close my eyes, I feel near you 
The words you gave me, and the remorseful tears 
Flowing, flowing, as the seasons pass again 
Repeating... 
 
When you want to cry, it's fine to cry 
If you hesitate, it's fine to not do it 
Until your sorrow clears away, I'll be here 
I'll be here supporting you 
 
To the future where the light shines 
Even though I don't know what's there 
Because there's nothing to be afraid of 
Without hesitating, come on, let's go 
 
Forever my friend, always, always 
I'm wishing, so that your smile shines 
Forever, always, no matter when 
You're not alone, no matter what happens 
The same song even now resonates, linking us 
The melody of our promise 
Oh, you're my best friend 
 
In order to become happy, people are born 
In order to find happiness, I gain strength 
Nobody can live on alone 
While they hold on to weakness 
 
Our frozen hands will meet 
Let's gather the shards of the dream we lost that day 
That our encounter was a wonderful miracle, let's sing our happiness 
 
Forever my friend, always, always 
It won't change, even if we choose different ways 
Even if we are separated, we can still meet again 
You're not alone, never, ever 
Under the same sky, I think, as I feel 
It'll definitely be okay 
 
Forever my friend, always, always 
I'm wishing, so that your smile shines 
Forever, always, no matter when 
You're not alone, no matter what happens 
The same song even now resonates, linking us 
The melody of our promise 
Our overflowing melody 
Oh, you're my best friend
