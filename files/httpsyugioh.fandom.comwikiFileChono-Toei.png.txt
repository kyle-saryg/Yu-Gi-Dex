 Ms. Chono  (蝶野先生  Chōno-sensei ) is a character in the  Yu-Gi-Oh!  manga . She is a teacher at  Domino High School . She earned the nickname  The Wicked Witch of Expel  (退学魔女リン  Taigaku Majo Rin ) after expelling fifteen students over the course of six months.
 Chono's beautiful appearance is due to the immensely thick layer of make-up she wears, which covers her true, ugly face. She enjoys dating, as it gives her the chance to dump men and watch them break down.

 Biography 
       Ms. Chono's true face being revealed     
 Ms. Chono was furious about getting dumped by a man she dated before she got a chance to do it the other way around. She decided to vent her anger on a class, which happened to be  Yugi 's, with a desk check, hoping to see them scared and finding a chance to expel them for finding "cool" things such as cigarettes, lipsticks, and condoms. She found a  love jigsaw puzzle  on  Miho Nosaka 's desk, and asked who it belonged to.
 She claimed that if the sender would confess, she may forgive him, which was a lie; she planned to expel the sender anyway. Yugi,  Katsuya Jonouchi  and  Hiroto Honda  all stood up, and indicated that the puzzle came from each of them. Not believing them, Chono decided to finish the puzzle to determine who the gift was from. Honda cursed Chono, saying that Ribbon was the one who was being hurt the most and one scene even showed Miho crying.
 Dark Yugi  emerged from the Puzzle and turned the gift into a  Shadow Game , where Chono felt the pain she was inflicting on others as she worked on the puzzle. When she finished the puzzle, her makeup turned into puzzle pieces and fell off, revealing her ugly face beneath. The other students laughed at her, causing her to run out of the room, stating that the class never happened and that she would get anyone who exposes her secret. Yugi later emerged, unable to remember what had happened and seemed confused that class was over. [1] 
 
 Personality 
 Chono is a sadist, gaining pleasure from humiliating or inflicting pain on others. She enjoys dating men so she can dump them and break their hearts, and feels it is her job to do so. She was infuriated when one man rejected her before she had a chance to do the same to him. She abused her privileges as a teacher and expelled many students to satisfy herself.
 Chono's weakness is her natural face, which she goes to great lengths to keep concealed. Once it was revealed to her class, she threatened them to keep quiet or she would set out to get them, while forgoing Honda's expulsion as she fled.
