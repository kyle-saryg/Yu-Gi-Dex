 " Gunkan " ( 軍 貫   Gunkan , lit. " Suship ") is an  archetype  that focuses on  Level / Rank  4  FIRE   Aqua   monsters  that debuted in  Dawn of Majesty . 
 
 Etymology 
 The archetype is based on a commonly-served kind of sushi called  gunkan-maki  (軍艦巻, literally "battleship-roll"), in which a ball of rice is wrapped around with seaweed and topped with a serving of seafood or vegetable. The name of the archetype itself is wordplay, using the characters「軍貫」instead of 「軍艦」. To keep in line with the popular name of the archetype prior to its localization, all "Gunkan" cards in the  TCG  also contain the word "Suship".
