      Harada, Yamanaka, and Teraoka.      The  Three Masked Knights  「仮面の三騎士  Kamen no Sankishi 」 were a group of hungry students consisting of  Harada ,  Yamanaka , and  Teraoka .
 Coming across  Marcel Bonaparte  in the library, they were seduced by promises of power to join him in his cause. (In the dub, they were promised food from the food storage facility if they Dueled.) Through the magic of a " Polymerization " card, each of them was fused with a Duel Monster spirit which robbed them of their free will. The Three Masked Knights simultaneously  Dueled   Jesse Anderson ,  Axel Brodie , and  Jim Crocodile Cook , serving as decoys while Marcel made his way to  the area  where the  Sacred Beasts  were sealed. They were returned to normal after being defeated.
