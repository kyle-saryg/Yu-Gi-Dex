 Featured Duel: Yuya Sakaki vs. Captain Cutter 
       Yuya  vs.  Cutter     
 At the start of the  Duel , the  Field Spell Card  " Crossover " is  activated , as per the rules of an  Action Duel . It will allow the players to use  Action Cards , but they may only have one in their  hand  at a time.
 Turn 1: Cutter 
 Captain Cutter  activates " Polymerization ",  fusing  the " Skull Mariner " and " Skull Knight #2 " in his hand to  Fusion Summon  " Captain Lock " (0/0) in  Attack Position . Its  effect  will prevent both players from Summoning or  Setting   monsters  from the hand, but if there's a monster on the field with at least 1000 or more ATK, "Captain Lock" will be destroyed. Cutter finds and activates the Action Card " Power Gem ",  targeting  a monster on the field and increasing its ATK by 800 ("Captain Lock": 0 → 800). Cutter Sets a card.
 Turn 2: Yuya 
 Yuya   draws  " Performapal Teamwork ", while his hand contains " Performapal Sword Fish ", " Stargazer Magician ", " Timegazer Magician ", " Odd-Eyes Pendulum Dragon " and " Performapal Hip Hippo ". Yuya attempts to find an Action Card, but Cutter takes the card first and activates it - " Fire Gem ", which inflicts 600  damage  (Yuya: 4000 → 3400). Yuya finds the Action Card " Cursed Gem " and activates it, taking 600 damage (Yuya: 3400 → 2800). Cutter finds and activates the Action Card "Fire Gem", inflicting 600 damage (Yuya: 2800 → 2200). Yuya attempts to find an Action Card, but fails and the card is caught by Cutter - "Power Gem". Yuya Sets a card.
 Turn 3: Cutter 
Cutter draws and activates the  Continuous Spell Card  " Battle at Sea ", which will double any  battle damage  inflicted by a  WATER  monster he  controls . "Captain Lock"  attacks   directly  (Yuya: 2200 → 600).
 At this point,  Sora Perse  joins the Duel and receives the 2000  LP  intrusion penalty (Sora: 4000 → 2000).
 Turn 4: Sora 
Sora activates "Polymerization", fusing the " Edge Imp Tomahawk " and " Fluffal Octopus " in his hand to Fusion Summon " Frightfur Kraken " (2200/3000) in Attack Position. As a monster with 1000 or more ATK is on the field, "Captain Lock" is destroyed. Cutter activates his  face-down   Continuous Trap Card  " Perished Pirate ", letting him target and Special Summon "Captain Lock" (0/0) from his  Graveyard  in Attack Position with its effects  negated . He then activates the other effect of "Perished Pirates": Once per turn, he can target and  equip  a monster from his Graveyard to the Summoned monster and increase the equipped monster's ATK by the ATK of that monster. He equips "Skull Mariner" ("Captain Lock": 0 → 1600).
 Cutter activates the Action Card "Power Gem", increasing a monster's ATK by 800 ("Captain Lock" 1600 → 2400). Yuya activates his face-down "Performapal Teamwork", letting him target a monster that was  Special Summoned  this turn and equip a " Performapal " monster with 1000 or less ATK from his hand to it. The equipped monster will gain ATK equal to the double the ATK of the monster equipped to it. He targets "Kraken" and equips it with "Sword Fish" ("Kraken": 2200 → 3400). "Kraken" attacks and destroys "Captain Lock" (Cutter: 4000 → 3000). "Kraken"'s effect lets it attack twice per  Battle Phase , so it attacks Cutter directly (Cutter: 3000 → 0).
