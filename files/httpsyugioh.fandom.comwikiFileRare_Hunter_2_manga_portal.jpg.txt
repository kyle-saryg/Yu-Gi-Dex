 Biography 
       Rare Hunter 2 in the manga.     
 Rare Hunter 2 and  Rare Hunter 3  were sent by  Marik Ishtar  to Duel  Dark Yugi  in  Battle City . The two confronted him and refused to let him past unless he could defeat them in Duels. They explained that Marik would kill them if they let him past and if he refused to Duel them,  Katsuya Jonouchi  would be killed. Neither of them wanted to be the first to Duel, so they played  roshambo  for it, but kept tying with each other. Eventually  Seto Kaiba  appeared and suggested that they both fight him and Dark Yugi as a Tag Team. Kaiba claimed that one of the reasons he held the tournament was to wipe out the counterfeiting Ghouls and he was Dueling them for that purpose, rather than helping Dark Yugi's friends. After a few turns, Kaiba easily defeated both Rare Hunters with " The God of Obelisk ". [2] 
 In the dub,  Lumis  claims to be this character. Although this is not stated in the Japanese version, both characters share the voice actor, Yu Mizushima.
