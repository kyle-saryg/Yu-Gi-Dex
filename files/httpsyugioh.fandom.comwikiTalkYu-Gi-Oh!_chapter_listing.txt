 Release Dates 
 I'm having trouble adding in cover dates to the listing (only Chapter 1 is noted). Fortunately, Comicvine's archive seems to have a complete Shonen Jump listing for these original issues and corresponding dates:

To start, here are some:
 
 Ch. 2 October 7, 1996 
 Ch. 3 October 14, 1996 
 Ch. 4 October 21, 1996 
 Ch. 5 October 28, 1996 
 Ch. 6 November 4, 1996
