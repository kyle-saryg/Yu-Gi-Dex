 Summary 
 Jaden  and  Jesse Anderson  go to investigate something they heard while opening new packs of cards at the  Slifer Red  dorm.  Axel Brodie  is training in the forest, hanging upside-down and suspended over a cliff. He recalls his time with his  father  years ago, who taught him to treat life as being in battle all the time - so that he would be prepared for life and death situations whenever they arise. He sees Jaden and Jesse chasing someone and they confront him, however Jesse realize that Axel was not the culprit and tells Jaden that Axel is Thelonious Viper's student.
 The next day,  Thelonious Viper  gives every student a  Bio-Band , which he had previously given to Jaden and Jesse before their  Duel . He states they will be used during  Survival Duels  and that such Duels will be conducted without restrictions relating to dorm color or grade. He states that Duel data collected from the bands is sent to a terminal, where Viper can analyze it. Viper later tells Axel that he wants his first opponent to be Jaden. He says that he must make Jaden play seriously and use all of his power - even if it means that Axel would lose.
 At the  Obelisk Blue  dorm,  Adrian Gecko  scans his Bio-Band and sends the data to a submarine near  Duel Academy .  His contact  in the sub warns him not to take his eyes off of Viper. Thelonious Viper is now entering his  lab  again, and Adrian follows him, attempting to go in after him, but the door refuses to open for him. Viper comments that he believes that Jaden has more Duel energy than anyone else.
 Syrus Truesdale  becomes unsure of the survival duels and goes to confront Jaden about them. Jaden is unable to give an answer, and as Syrus runs off only Jesse appears to worry about the things he said. Syrus begins walking around the grounds and vows to Duel the first person he comes across - it ends up being Axel Brodie, whom he challenges. Upon hearing that Syrus is Jaden's best friend, Axel ties him up and suspends him from device he had previously been training on. Meanwhile, back to the Slifer dorm, Jesse and Hassleberry are arguing over Hassleberry's desk when  Winged Kuriboh  informs Jaden what has happened, and he, Jesse and  Tyranno Hassleberry  rush to Syrus' aide. Axel challenges Jaden and Jaden accepts in order to save Syrus.

 Featured Duel: Jaden Yuki vs. Axel Brodie 
 Turn 1: Jaden 
Jaden draws " Elemental Mirage ". Jaden's hand contains " Polymerization ", " Elemental Hero Avian ", " Elemental Hero Burstinatrix ", " De-Fusion ", and " Elemental Hero Neos ". Jaden then  activates  "Polymerization" to fuse "Elemental Hero Avian" with "Elemental Hero Burstinatrix" in order to  Fusion Summon  " Elemental Hero Flame Wingman " (2100/1200) in  Attack Position . Jaden then  Sets  two cards.
 Turn 2: Axel 
Axel draws " Blaze Accelerator " and subsequently activates it. Now Axel, during each of his Main Phases, can send 1 Pyro-type monster with 500 or less ATK from his hand to the Graveyard to destroy one monster on Jaden's side of the field. If Axel activates the effect of "Blaze Accelerator", he will be forbidden from attacking the turn he activates this effect. Axel then activates the effect of "Blaze Accelerator" to  send  " Volcanic Shell " from his  hand  to the  Graveyard  and destroy "Flame Wingman", but Jaden activates his face-down "De-Fusion" to return "Flame Wingman" to his  Fusion Deck  and  Special Summon  "Avian" (1000/1000) and "Burstinatrix" (1200/800) from his  Graveyard  in Attack Position. 
 Since "Volcanic Shell" is in his Graveyard, Axel activates the effect of "Volcanic Shell" to  pay  500  Life Points  (Axel 4000 → 3500) and add another "Volcanic Shell" from his  Deck  to his hand. Axel then activates the effect of "Blaze Accelerator" to send "Volcanic Shell" from his hand to the Graveyard and destroy "Burstinatrix". Axel then Sets a card (" Firewall ").
 Duel continues in  the next episode .
