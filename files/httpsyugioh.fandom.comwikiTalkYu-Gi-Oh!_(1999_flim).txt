 Title 
 I think this page should be moved to  Yu-Gi-Oh! (1999 film) , as it was never referred to as  Yu-Gi-Oh! The Movie . In fact, that creates some confusion with the second Yu-Gi-Oh! movie, which was exclusively known as  Yu-Gi-Oh! The Movie  in North America. Just a thought. - SlashMan  ( talk  •  contribs ) 03:53, June 26, 2015 (UTC)
 
 Personally I don't think there is anything wrong with the current name, though I suppose it doesn't hurt to be more specific. 
 That said, I think "Yu-Gi-Oh! (Toei Movie)" or something along those lines would work just as well

 Just reviving this discussion here, this current title here seems like pure conjecture, and it should just go by its official title,  Yu-Gi-Oh!  with a parenthetical disambiguation. Again, Just going by  Yu-Gi-Oh! The Movie  is problematic because that title was widely used for the 2004 film. - SlashMan  ( talk  •  contribs ) 02:54, July 17, 2017 (UTC) 
 I'm fine with  Yu-Gi-Oh! (1999 film)  (or even  Yu-Gi-Oh! (Toei film) ) , given it's just called  Yu-Gi-Oh!  in Japanese (and there's no official English name).  Becasita   Pendulum   ( talk  •  contribs )  11:30, July 17, 2017 (UTC) 
 I'm not a regular at this Wiki, but I agree. "Yu-Gi-Oh! The Movie" is a title, but it's not the title of this movie. It's an official title of a different movie, but this movie is officially called "Yu-Gi-Oh!". Just calling the article "Yu-Gi-Oh! (Toei film)" or "Yu-Gi-Oh! (1999 film)" similar to how Wikipedia titles its films would be far less misleading. {{SUBST:User:Uknownada/Sig}} 03:10, October 30, 2017 (UTC)
