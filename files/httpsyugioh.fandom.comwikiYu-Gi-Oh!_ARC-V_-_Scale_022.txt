 Summary 
 As  Ren  obtains an  Action Card ,  Yuya  tribute summons  Enter-Mate Clay Breaker  while activating the spell card  Pendulum Halt  to draw two more cards since he has  Yugo 's  Pendulum Monsters  in their  Extra Deck . While Ren uses two Action Cards to gain an advantage while suspecting his opponent intends to increase his monster's attack points, Yuya reveals Claymaker's special ability allows him to decrease Biphamet's ATK by 500 for each face-up Pendulum Monster. While the attack connects with Ren's life points dwindled to 1350, Biphamet heals as its owner laughs while confusing Yuya by mentioning his past life. Ren then explains to Yuya that a more difficult trail would await the boy even if he should defeat him, Ren adding that he needs the power of  Genesis Omega Dragon  to achieve one thing he will get at any cost.
 Ren proceeds to reveal to Yuya that he once was a Turbo Duelist who aspired to become as great as a legendary Turbo Dueling genius he admired as a child though he lacked the resources to fully realize his dream. But Ren's life changed the day he received the opportunity to participate in the Memorial Race, learning that his dying father used all his remaining money to buy his son a  Duel Runner . While this motivated Ren to win to honor his father, he nearly died before he suddenly came back to life and won the Turbo Duel. Soon after, Ren noticed a butterfly and followed it to the garage where he encounters a woman:  Eve , who tells him that G.O.D has chosen him. The wealthy old man Ren became would encounter Eve sixty years later near the end of his life, Eve taking him away to repay the debt he owes her for giving him new life. Concluding his story, Ren proceeds to unmask himself with Yuya recognizing his face to be Yugo's.
 
 Featured Duel: Yugo/Yuya Sakaki vs. Ren 
 Duel continues from the previous Scale . 
 Turn 6: Yuya Sakaki 
 Ren  obtains an  Action Card . Yuya  Tributes  " Enter-Mate Rolling Sambaa " to  Tribute Summon  " Enter-Mate Clay Breaker " (2000/1000). He then  activates  " Pendulum Halt ", allowing him to  draw  two cards since there's at least three  face-up   Pendulum Monsters  in his  Extra Deck . Yuya  attacks  " White Aura Biphamet " with "Clay Breaker". Ren activates two Action Cards: " Full Turn ", which will double any  battle damage  inflicted this  turn , and " Limit Lock ", preventing Yuya from increasing his monster's  ATK  this turn. Since it was Tribute Summoned, the effect of "Clay Breaker" activates, decreasing the ATK of "Biphamet" by 500 for each face-up Pendulum Monster in Yuya's Extra Deck ("Biphament": 3300 → 1800 ATK). The attack hits, and due to the effect of "Full Turn", the battle damage inflicted to Ren is doubled (Ren: 1750 → 1350 LP). Despite this, "Biphamet" is not destroyed. [Notes 1] 
 Duel continues in the next Scale .
