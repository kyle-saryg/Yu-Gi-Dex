 Turn 3: Yuga 
Yuga activates the effect of " Super Magitek Deity Magnum Over Road (R) ", sending the top card of his Deck to the GY to target 1 face-up monster Nail controls and have it gain ATK equal to the Level of that monster x 200 until the End Phase. He targets " Yggdrago the Heavenly Emperor Dragon Tree " ("Over Road": 3500 → 5500 ATK). " Super Magitek Deity Magnum Over Road " attacks "Yggdrago", but Nail activates his set Trap " Absurd Discharge ", preventing "Yggdrago" from being destroyed by that battle and inflicting the same amount of Battle Damage to Yuga (Nail: 4000 → 2500 LP) (Yuga: 4000 → 2500 LP). The other effect of "Absurd Discharge" would destroy the attacking monster, but the effect of "Over Road" prevents it from being destroyed by Trap effects.
 Turn 4: Nail 
Since Nail has no cards in his hand, he draws five cards. He sets two cards. He then activates " Pair Production ", letting him send 2 copies of a Level 5 or lower  Cyberse  monster from his hand to the GY to increase the ATK of a monster he controls by the sent monster's Level x 400 until the End Phase. He sends two copies of " Picock Hightron " and targets "Yggdrago" ("Yggdrago": 4000 → 6000 ATK). "Yggdrago" attacks "Over Road", but since Nail declared an attack, Yuga activates his set Trap " Emergency Reentry ", returning a Level 5 or higher monster he controls to his hand to negate the attack. He returns "Over Road" to his hand so the attack is negated.
 Turn 5: Yuga 
Since Yuga has three cards in his hand, he draws two cards. Since Yuga drew a card(s), Nail activates his set Trap " Paradigm Shift ", forcing Yuga to shuffle his entire hand into his Deck and draw the same number of cards. Yuga Normal Summons " Kuribot " (300/200). Since Yuga controls no other monsters, he activates the effect of "Kuribot", allowing him to pay 500 LP (Yuga: 2500 → 2000 LP) to add another copy of "Kuribot" from his GY to his hand. Yuga tributes "Kuribot" to Tribute Summon " Sevens Road Witch " (1600/1000). Yuga activates the effect of "Sevens Road Witch", letting him send 1 card from his hand to the GY to Special Summon 1 Level 7 or higher  DARK   Spellcaster  monster from his hand. He sends "Kuribot" to the GY and Special Summons " Sevens Road Magician " (2100/1500) in Attack Position. Since he Special Summoned "Sevens Road Magician" with its effect, "Sevens Road Witch" gains 400 ATK ("Sevens Road Witch": 1600 → 2000 ATK) until the End Phase. Yuga activates the effect of "Sevens Road Magician", sending the top card of his Deck to the GY to increase the ATK of "Sevens Road Magician" by 300 for each different Attribute in his GY until the End Phase ("Sevens Road Magician": 2100 → 3000 ATK).
 Since Yuga controls a Level 7 or higher Spellcaster monster, he activates " Road Magic - Diastrophism ", allowing him to send an  EARTH  monster from his hand to the GY to decrease the ATK of a monster Nail controls by the ATK of the monster in Yuga's GY with the highest ATK. He sends " Rescue Magician " to the GY and targets "Yggdrago", with " Fullmeteor Impact " being the monster with the highest ATK in Yuga's GY ("Yggdrago: 4000 → 1500 ATK). "Sevens Road Magician" attacks "Yggdrago", but since a face-up Cyberse monster was attacked, Nail activates his set Trap " Absurd Charge Hole ", preventing "Yggdrago" from being destroyed by that battle (Nail: 2500 → 1000 LP). The other effect of "Absurd Charge Hole" then increases Nail's LP by double the Battle Damage he took from that battle as well as ending the Battle Phase (Nail: 1000 → 4000 LP). 
 Turn 6: Nail 
Since Nail has no cards in his hand, he draws five cards. He sets three cards. Nail then activates the effect of " Yggdrago the Heavenly Emperor Dragon Tree [L] ", sending the top three cards of his Deck to the GY to destroy 1 level 8 or lower monster Yuga controls. He destroys "Sevens Road Magician". "Yggdrago" attacks "Sevens Road Witch", but since Nail declared an attack, Yuga activates his set Trap " Magical Switch ", letting Yuga Special Summon a Spellcaster monster from his GY and then sending a Spellcaster monster on his field to the GY. He Special Summons "Sevens Road Magician" (2100/1500) and sends "Sevens Road Witch" to the GY. A replay occurs and "Yggdrago" attacks and destroys "Sevens Road Magician" (Yuga: 2000 → 100 LP).
 Turn 7: Yuga 
Since Yuga has no cards in his hand, he draws five cards. Yuga Normal Summons " Mystic Dealer " (1000/0). He then activates the effect of "Mystic Dealer", sending 1 Spellcaster monster from his hand to the GY to draw a card. He draws " Super Magitek Deity Magnum Over Road (L) ". Yuga then activates " Recovery Force ", letting him shuffle 3 Spellcaster monsters from his GY to his Deck to draw a card. He draws "Super Magitek Deity Magnum Over Road (R)". Yuga tributes "Mystic Dealer" to Tribute Summon " Necmaid Nana " (1100/700). As Yuga Normal Summoned a monster with 1000 or more ATK, Nail activates his set Trap " Trap Hole ", destroying that monster. Since Yuga has at least 3 Level 5 or higher monsters with different Types in his GY, Yuga activates " Silent Learning ", letting him look at 1 set card in Nail's Spell & Trap Card Zone and draw one card if the chosen card is a Trap Card, by first placing a Level 5 or higher monster from his GY to the bottom of his Deck. He reveals Nail's set " Pair Annihilation ", puts "Sevens Road Magician" at the bottom of the Deck and draws "Super Magitek Deity Magnum Over Road". 
 Since Yuga drew a card(s), Nail activates his set Trap "Paradigm Shift", forcing Yuga to shuffle his entire hand into his Deck and draw the same amount of cards. Yuga activates " Kuribottriple ", allowing him to shuffle 3 copies of "Kuribot" from his GY into his Deck to draw 2 cards. He draws "Super Magitek Deity Magnum Over Road (L)" and "Super Magitek Deity Magnum Over Road (R)". Yuga then Maximum Summons "Super Magitek Deity Magnum Over Road", "Super Magitek Deity Magnum Over Road [L]" and "Super Magitek Deity Magnum Over Road [R]" (Max. 3500/0). Yuga activates the effect of "Over Road (R)", sending the top card of his Deck to the GY to target 1 face-up monster Nail controls and have it gain ATK equal to the Level of that monster x 200 until the End Phase. He targets "Yggdrago the Heavenly Emperor Dragon Tree" ("Over Road": 3500 → 5500 ATK). Since his LP are lower than his opponent's, Yuga then activates the effect of "Over Road (L)", letting him send a card from his hand to the GY to increase the ATK of "Over Road" by the difference between both players' LP until the End Phase ("Over Road": 5500 → 9400 ATK).
 "Over Road" attacks and destroys "Yggdrago" (Nail: 4000 → 0 LP).
