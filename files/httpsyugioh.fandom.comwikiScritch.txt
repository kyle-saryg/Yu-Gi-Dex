 Design 
 Appearance 
       Scritch's human form      Scritch is a man of small stature who wears ninja-clothing, including a cape, a sword and goggles.
 In his Barian form, he is a black mosquito-like humanoid with distinctively round eyes with ripples. His mouth and nose now resemble the needle-like mouth that a mosquito possesses.
 
 Personality 
 Attributed to his insect motif, Scritch dislikes big things, as such he's a firm believer that being bigger is not synonymous of being better. He also demonstrates certain pride on his " Number " which is diminutive in size but large in destructive power. Like the other members of the  Fearsome Four , he's not above cheating in his Duels. Scritch also has the habit of adding "ka" to his sentences.
 
 Abilities 
 Scritch has the ability to transform himself into a small mosquito. In this form he can fly and sting people, being capable of injecting an hallucinating poison that can make the victim believe the friend is the foe and vice-versa. Like other members of the  Fearsome Four , he's capable of summoning a  Barian Emblem  in order to halve the  Life Points  of his opponents and add that value to his own.
 
 Etymology 
 "Ka" means "mosquito". "Scritch" is derived from "scratch", which is a reference to how mosquito bite victims tend to scratch the areas where they were bitten.
 
 Biography 
 Past life 
 Scritch was once a human who worked with  Mr. Heartland  as a Dueling criminal until he died. He was later reincarnated as a  Barian . [1] 
 
 Yu-Gi-Oh! ZEXAL II 
 After  Erazor 's failure to defeat  Yuma Tsukumo  and  Chironex 's failure to defeat  Reginald Kastle ,  Mr. Heartland  decided to send Scritch to investigate  Kite Tenjo , who disappeared from  Heartland City . Taken the form of a mosquito, Scritch observed Kite's conversation with  Yuma  and  Tori  regarding  Astral , and proceeded to inflict a hallucinative poison on him, unknown to Yuma. Later, he attempted to prevent Kite and  Quinton  from sending Yuma off to the  Astral World  and initiated a Duel with the two. [2] 
 Using the  effects  of " Number 2: Ninja Shadow Mosquito " and the poison that he had injected Kite with earlier, he gained a significant advantage, causing Kite to think that he was Quinton and vice-versa, resulting in Kite defending Scritch. Quinton was able to break Kite free from the hallucination, allowing Kite to make a comeback and  defeat Scritch with a single attack  from a powered up " Galaxy-Eyes Photon Dragon ", causing him to vanish as Erazor and Chironex had and relinquishing his "Number" to Kite [3] 
 
 Deck 
 Scritch uses a  Mosquito-themed Deck , focused on swarm tactics to quickly  Xyz Summon  " Number 2: Ninja Shadow Mosquito ".
