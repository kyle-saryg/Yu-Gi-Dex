 Description 
 Rage burns inside its molten core! Doomfire shall scourge the lands! 
 
 Featuring: 
" Volcanic Doomfire ," This monster destroys all of your opponent's monsters when it destroys a monster in battle and sends it to the Graveyard. Your opponent will take 500 damage for each monster destroyed by this effect. 
" Gaia Plate the Earth Giant ," The effect of this Rock-Type monster halves the ATK/DEF of any monster battling it. It can be Special Summoned by banishing two Rock-Type monsters from your Graveyard. 
" Lyla, Lightsworn Sorceress ," You can destroy 1 Spell/Trap Card your opponent controls in exchange for this monster being stuck in Defense Position until the end of the next turn. Its effect will also send 3 cards from your Deck to your Graveyard at the end of each turn, so keep an eye on how many cards are left in your Deck. 
" Forbidden Dress ," While this Spell Card will decrease the ATK of a monster, it will protect that monster from being targeted or destroyed by card effects. Activate it before your opponent activates their effect to prevent your monster from being targeted, or chain it to protect your monster from an effect that would destroy it.
