 Damage calculation  (Japanese: ダメージ 計 算   damēji keisan ) is the process during the  Damage Step  of calculating the  battle damage  done to  Life Points  from an  attack  and determining which  monster(s)  is to be  destroyed  (if any). When a  direct attack  is performed, the damage inflicted is equal to the current ATK of the attacking monster unless stated on the card, as is the case with " Cyberdark Edge ".
