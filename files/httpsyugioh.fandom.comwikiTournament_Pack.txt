 Tournament Packs  (トーナメントパック  Tōnamentopakku ) are a series of packs that were issued at Tournaments.
 They often contain unique cards not found in other sets, as well as reprints of older cards in  Super Rare  and  Ultra Rare  rarities. Eight Tournament Packs were released. Most Tournament Packs include very rare deck staples such as " Morphing Jar ", as well was unreleased  OCG  cards, although these usually held no particular use.
 They were succeeded by the  Champion Pack  series.
