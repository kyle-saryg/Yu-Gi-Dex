 In  episode 113 , the  Familiar of Red Nova  uses this card during his Ground  Duel  against  Jack Atlas . He summons it by banishing " Abyss Kid ", " Abyss Boat Watchman ", and " Abyss Guardian " from his Graveyard. This card then attacks directly, but Jack activates " Red Screen " to prevent this card from attacking. The Familiar then activates this card's effect to destroy "Red Screen" and inflict 600 damage to Jack. On the last turn of the Duel, " Red Nova Dragon " (whose ATK was 5500 due to its own effect) attacks and destroys this card, winning Jack the Duel.
