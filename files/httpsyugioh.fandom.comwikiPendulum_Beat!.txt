 Lyrics (TV Size) 
 Rōmaji English 
 
 Fly away, far away 
Jibun no kabe 
Yume wa miru monjanai kanaerumonda 
Kizudarake ninattemo akiramenai 
Shinjita michi, sore ga nozomu sekai Dash! 
Susume! Dash! 
 
My life and my way bouken no you na nichijou 
Seikai mo machigai monai sousa jibun shidai 
Special original de kiseki okosouze 
Nando nando demo tachiagarusa 
 
Pendulum! Mugen ni suzuku jigen 
Pendulum! Nido tonai hibi de 
Pendulum! Minna wo egao ni kaete 
 
Go our way kagayaita mirrai tsukame 
Donna kurayami mo kono te de hikari terashite miseru! 
Tobidashite mitakotonai sekai he 
Koukai wa shinaize kakenukete 
Furiko no you ni egaki dasou, smile! 
 
So Smile! 
So Smile!
 
 
 
 Fly away, far away 
Over your own walls! 
Don't just have dreams, achieve them. 
Even if you're covered with wounds, don't give up. 
Go down the path you believe, the world you want, Dash! 
Go forward! Dash! 
 
My Life and My Way, day to day seems like an adventure. 
There is no right or wrong, yeah, it's all up to me. 
Let's make a special and original miracle happen. 
Stand up again and again no matter what. 
 
Pendulum, the dimensions expanding infinitely! 
Pendulum, the days that won't come back again. 
Pendulum! Make everyone smile! 
 
Go Our Way! To get that bright future! 
No matter how deep the darkness, I'll shine a light through it with this hand! 
Leap forth, into a world you've never seen! 
I won't regret it, I'll make it through! 
Draw out a grin like a pendulum, Smile! 
 
So Smile! 
So Smile!
