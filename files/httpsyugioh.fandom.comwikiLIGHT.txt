 LIGHT  ( 光   Hikari ) monsters are the historic opposites of  DARK  Monsters. " Blue-Eyes White Dragon ", the components of " XYZ-Dragon Cannon ", and monsters such as " D.D. Warrior Lady ", and " Honest ", are LIGHT. LIGHT monsters are represented often by  Fairy ,  Spellcaster ,  Thunder ,  Machine  and   Warrior - Type .
 Some LIGHT cards focus on overwhelming offensive power, such as the "Blue-Eyes White Dragon" and the fusions of " Cyber Dragon ", but others focus on positively reinforcing the player instead of damaging the opponent, such as by increasing  Life Points  or allowing the player to draw extra cards. LIGHT monsters will generally either be highly offensive or highly defensive with little middle ground. In Decks themed around multiple  Attributes , the trump card of the set is often LIGHT, such as " Rainbow Dragon " for the " Crystal Beasts ", " Elemental HERO Shining Flare Wingman ", and " Elemental HERO Neos " in " Elemental HERO " builds. Some LIGHT monsters reveal their strategy due to the follow up if the strategy is successfully carried out.
 Notably, the Attribute of the Monsters do not necessarily indicate morality and alignment. An example made can be from "Blue-Eyes White Dragon", which represents  Kisara's  pure soul and draws its powerful existence from her Ka, but known as an engine of destruction and put to use by less than wholesome players, such as an egotistic and twisted younger Seto Kaiba. This showcases the Attribute's possibly for good or evil, as with any attribute.  
 LIGHT Archetypes representing good, heroism, virtue, valiance and divinity do exist, such as " Constellar ", " Lightsworn ", " Utopia ", and " Noble Knight ". Furthermore, some Fiend and Zombie monster are LIGHT-attribute. This shows that not all monsters of those types are evil and corrupted, and LIGHT also symbolizes redemption, repentance, salvation, atonement, faith and enlightenment.  
 Being LIGHT monsters however, neither guarantees that such of an attribute are saintly, pure and virtuous, with LIGHT also representing elitism, the lurid and unwholesome made existent, decadence and bending light to create illusions of good and distortions of others. This can be seen in monsters as the  Fabled ,  Worms , and  Arcana Force  are antagonistic beings according to card lore or the  anime , which also features an  evil entity  of LIGHT. 
 Although not exclusively, almost all monsters that appear to have electric-based powers and are not Thunder-Type are LIGHT Attribute. Examples include " Super Conductor Tyranno ", one of only two LIGHT Dinosaur monsters in the game; " Voltic Kong "; " Elemental HERO Thunder Giant "; " Gilford the Lightning " and " Number 91: Thunder Spark Dragon ".
 LIGHT-based  archetypes  include: " Blue-Eyes ", " Silent Swordsman ", " Silent Magician , " Arcana Force ", " Batteryman ", " Fabled ", " Hieratic ", " Satellarknight ", " Star Seraph ", " Lightray ", " Lightsworn ", " Noble Knight ", " Ojama ", " Photon ", " Galaxy ", " Constellar ", " Vylon ", " Bujin ", " Watt ",  " Worms " , " The Agent ", " Utopia ", " Melodious ", " Artifact ", “ Trickstar “ and " PSY-Frame ".
