 Rules 
 The game's main players were  Yami Yugi  and  Yami Bakura . The game also had NPCs, who were the citizens of Ancient Egypt and people from the modern world who entered the game world.
 Each player had different characters, and the player can influence the acts of their respective characters. Each character had a  ba  gauge. When a character's  ba  runs out, that character dies (or gets sent to the  Shadow Realm  in the dub). A character can summon and battle with  ka  by giving up some of their  ba .
 If a player does not command anything to their character, they act on their own as they did 3000 (or 5000 in the dub) years ago. Each player also had Master Items, which are used to help the player throughout the game.
