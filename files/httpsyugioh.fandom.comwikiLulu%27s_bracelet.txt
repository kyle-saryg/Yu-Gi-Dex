 Appearance 
       The bracelet at a different angle     
 It is a thin, single banded bracelet with a wing-shaped design framing a yellow, diamond-shaped jewel. 
 The metallic wing pieces paralleling each other are reminiscent of the creation of the overlay network in an  Xyz Summon . The design might also be inspired by "the traditional themes of natural beauty in Japanese aesthetics" ( 花 鳥 風 月 ), representing " 鳥 " (bird) for Lulu and her  Winged Beast  deck -  Lyrilusc . It might also be referenced by Lulu wearing bird-representative feather accessories for earrings and hair clips.
 
 Biography 
 History 
       Lulu's bracelet original form.     
 The bracelet was originally a  card  created by  Leo Akaba  using natural energy from birds. It was used with the  other   three   cards  to confront  Z-ARC , however,  Ray  took them from her father in order to oppose Z-ARC herself. During the Duel, the card took its shape as the bracelet and appeared on Ray's right arm. Along with the others, the bracelet helped her stop  Supreme King Z-ARC , and split him, along with herself and the  Original Dimension . Later, Lulu gained ownership of the bracelet. [1] 
 Lulu wore this bracelet when observing  Dennis ' magic show in  Heartland , who identified her precisely because of it and lead to her capture by  Yuri . [2]

         Riley with the Natural Energy Bracelets.     
 When Lulu was transferred into  ARC-V [3] , her bracelet returned to its  card form . It was then taken with the  other   three   cards  by  Leo  to use against  Z-ARC  again, but they were  destroyed  by Z-ARC, who defeated Leo. [4]  However, using  Riley 's body,  Ray  retrieved the  Natural Energy Cards  from the  Graveyard  and activated them to slowly strip away " Supreme King Z-ARC 's" protection effects and causing the  Natural Energy Bracelets  to materialize on Riley's arm. With  Yuya 's  help , Ray defeated Z-ARC again with the effects of the Natural Energy Cards and Riley sealed away Z-ARC's spirit within her own body to prevent his soul from being split again. [5] 
 Following the battle against Z-ARC and the  Standard Dimension 's rebirth into the  "Pendulum Dimension" , the bracelet disappeared following Riley's regression into an infant. [6]
