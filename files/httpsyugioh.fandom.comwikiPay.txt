 To  pay  (Japanese:  払 う  harau ) is to give up  LP  for a  card effect  or  cost . Typically, paying LP is a cost, although some cards involve  paying LP for an effect .
 A player cannot pay more LP than they have left. If paying LP is a requirement to activate a card or effect and the player cannot, that card or effect cannot be activated. If paying LP is part of a  maintenance cost  and the player cannot, that card is destroyed (even if the payment is mandatory). [1]  " Destructive Draw " is the only exception to this rule, which states in its  card text  that if its  controller  cannot pay its maintenance cost, instead that player's LP become 0.
 In the  OCG , a player can pay LP equal to their current LP. [2]  As such, if a mandatory maintenance cost (such as that of " Terrorking Archfiend ") requires the player to pay the exact amount of LP they have remaining, that cost must be paid and that player loses the Duel.
 " Spell Economics " allows the player to activate  Spell Cards  that normally require LP to be  paid as a cost , such as " Dimension Fusion " and " Brain Control ", without paying those LP.
