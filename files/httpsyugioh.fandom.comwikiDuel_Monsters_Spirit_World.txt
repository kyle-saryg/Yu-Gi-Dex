The  Duel Monsters Spirit World  (デュエルモンスターズの精霊世界  Dyueru Monsutāzu no Seirei Sekai ) is the series of connected alternate dimensions inhabited by  Duel Monster Spirits . Its connection to the real world is unclear, but humans have been shown capable of summoning these spirits to Earth in different ways, with the spirits sometimes even representing their  souls . Some humans have ended up presiding within it after their death, by fusing with a Duel Monster (leading to the creation of monsters such as  Dark Magician ). Regardless of its ambiguousness in its relationship to Earth, and whether or not the different Spirit Worlds within the different Yu-Gi-Oh! series are related to each other within the same canon, it takes on a prominent role in the first three  NAS   Yu-Gi-Oh!  animes.

 History 
 Creation 
 In  Yu-Gi-Oh! GX,   Nightshroud  claims that the spirits of Duel Monsters are from the origin of the world. [1]  He claims that when the universe began, it split into darkness and light. [2]  (Assuming the canons of the different series are consistent, it is unknown if this was the result of the  Numeron Dragon , from  Yu-Gi-Oh! ZEXAL , creating the universe). Nightshroud states that as the light vanished, the darkness filled the universe and created everything in the world, including life. [2] [3]  Nightshroud uses a single card as a metaphor for the origins of the world (this card having a relation to the  Numeron Code  from  ZEXAL , or even being the Code itself, is possible but unconfirmed). The front of the card represented the human world and the Duel Monsters Spirit World (although how these worlds came into being was never stated in detail), while the other side of the card was the  World of Darkness . [1] [4]  After humans came into existence, they inevitably discovered the Duel Monsters. According to Nightshroud, Duel Monsters became a touchstone to test their souls. [1]   The impact that different gods in the series, such as the  Egyptian Gods , the  Crimson Dragon , and the  Aesir , had on the origins of these different spirit worlds is unknown, but these deities are shown to take agency on Earth when they are summoned by Duelists.
 
 Human discovery 
       Temple found by Ironheart to summon the Duel Monsters.     
 Duel monsters were first discovered by the humans in the ancient city of  Atlantis , 10,000 years before the start of the series. When its monarch  Dartz  tried to destroy the world with an army of  Orichalcos Soldiers , his father,  Ironheart , opposed him. He went to a temple and requested the assistance of the  Duel Monster Spirits , which they agreed to lend. After the engagement known as the Battle of the Stone Wasteland,  The Great Leviathan  was defeated by Ironheart's army. Before his death, Ironheart sealed the gateway to the Duel Monsters Spirit World, leaving behind their spirits scattered across the planet. Some were left in the Egyptian pyramids, the Greek temples, the Aztec pyramids, the Egyptian mastabas.  Dartz  survived, and began wandering the Earth gathering souls using the Orichalcos to revive The Great Leviathan to destroy and reconstruct both the Human World and the Duel Monsters Spirit World in his own image. [5] 
 
 Ancient Egypt 
 The seal Ironheart had put to the Duel Monsters Spirit World was broken in ancient Egypt, 3,000 years (5,000 in the English version) before the start of the series. [6]  The Egyptians used stone tablets to seal the Duel Monster Spirits and summon them to fight battles. [7] 
 The Egyptians harnessed the power of the Duel Spirits for use in their  Shadow Games . It is implied that Duel Spirits were the basis for the Egyptian concepts of  ka  and  ba .
 These events were recorded in the  Book of Thoth  and was passed from generation to generation. [7]  These events caused Dartz to become interested again in destroying both worlds. He needed the soul of  Atem  to do so, however, the pharaoh disappeared. Dartz believed that Atem is the one that should put an end to human and Duel Monsters history though Dartz could not capture the Pharaoh's soul because  Bandit King Bakura  and  Zorc Necrophades  opposed him. [6] 
 
 Ancient Rome 
 Julius Caesar , leader of the ancient Roman Empire, gathered seven gems from across the world to show his authority. However, they were lost on their way back to Rome in a ship wreckage. [8]  Caesar also held control of the tablet of the  Rainbow Dragon  and he hid it from everyone. [9]  These artifacts are used to summon the Duel Spirits of the  Crystal Beasts . [10] 
 
 Duel Monsters' cards 
 The events of ancient Egypt eventually inspired the creation of the tarot cards and all other card games. [7]   Maximillion Pegasus  discovered the Duel Monsters, the origin of the world, [1]  in the  Valley of the Kings  7 years before the start of the series and created the  Duel Monsters' card game  from it. He created them in order to bring the ancient Egyptian battles to modern times. [7]  By creating the cards, he unknowingly created a gate that connects the human world and the Duel Monsters Spirit World. [11] 
 
 Early manga 
       Seto Kaiba's brief encounter with the world of the Duel Spirits.     
 The Duel Monsters Spirit World appeared in the early manga as a Penalty Game for  Seto Kaiba  after having lost  a Duel  to  Dark Yugi . Kaiba suffered the Experience of Death  Penalty Game , where he believed he was sent to a world of Duel Monsters by being imprisoned in a card. There he was menaced by Duel Spirits such as " Blackland Fire Dragon ", " Mameda ", " Jellome ", and " Lion ". [12] 
 This was the first  Shadow Duel , and it involved the summoning of real Duel Monsters as the pictures of the card materialized. The monsters could also make their own decisions such as the  Blue Eyes White Dragon  decided not to attack Yugi and self-destruct. [13]  This incident inspires Kaiba to create his hologram technology of  Duel Boxes . [14] 
 
 Yu-Gi-Oh! Duel Monsters 
       The dimension the two Yugis appeared in.     
 The first appearance of the Duel Monsters Spirit World in the second series anime is in  Bakura 's Duel with  Yami Yugi  during the  Duelist Kingdom arc . The monsters that were destroyed were sent to a graveyard type dimension of the spirit world where the  Reaper of the Cards  lives and will try to claim their souls. [15]  It is even accessed when  Yami Bakura  sent Pegasus' men there outside of a Duel. [16] 
 The  Waking the Dragons  arc was the first to establish that Duel Spirits have their own society. Yugi, Kaiba, and  Joey Wheeler  each visit the world to unlock their respective  Legendary Dragons . The portion of the dimension they visit, called the Dominion of the Beasts, includes a large, medieval-style castle, with a vast forest nearby as well as a floating island. There, they meet many small monsters, especially  Fairy -Types, all of whom appear battered and weary from their battles with  the Great Leviathan . This group appears to be led by  Dark Magician Girl .
 In addition, many Duel Spirits escaped to the human world during the Orichalcos crisis, perhaps fleeing the Leviathan's wrath upon their home dimensions.
 
 Yu-Gi-Oh! GX 
 The Spirit World figures most prominently in  GX , where it is the primary setting of the  third season . This series establishes that there are eleven Duel Spirit Dimensions, each accessible from both the others and the human world. As a result of Yubel's actions in the third season, these dimensions were slowly converging into each other, threatening to destroy one another until Jaden's fusion with  Yubel  undid the entire ordeal.
 The first one seen is a ruins-based area where the  Gravekeeper's Chief  and his tribe resided.
 What may be the same Fairy-inhabited dimension from  Duel Monsters  appears when Jaden is transported to an underground blue cave where he encounters the spirit of  Kaibaman  and is defeated by him in a Duel. Many of the same inhabitants of that dimension appear as spectators of the Duel.
 
         The Duel Spirits' forces do battle with  the Light of Destruction 's invading army.     
 Neo Space  is introduced as one of the dimensions early in the second season. Jaden travels there and finds that it is under siege from an extradimensional entity known as  the Light of Destruction , which does not appear to hail from any of the Duel Spirit Dimensions and seeks to dominate them. Jaden defeats one of the Light's soldiers here and receives his second Deck, mainly comprised of monsters he designed for a contest as a child. Later, it is revealed that Jaden's past life was to become  the Supreme King  of this dimension, as he wielded the Darkness of Justice, the only weapon that could defeat the Light. The young man's best friend, Yubel, was transformed into a monster herself to protect him until he came of age.
 
         Duel Academy  arrives in the desert dimension.     
 In the third season, Yubel, herself tainted by the Light and possessing  Marcel Bonaparte , transports Duel Academy to another of the dimensions, a vast desert. Yubel, through Marcel, could call the inhabitants of this dimension, such as  Titan, the Rock Spirit ,  Sand Stone , and  Sand Moth , to her aid through her special Duel Disk.  Jesse Anderson  sacrifices himself to get Duel Academy back to Earth.
 
         The icy area.     
         Dark World inhabitants.     
 To save Jesse, Jaden and his friends venture to the Spirit World again, this time into the  Dark World , inhabited mostly be  Fiend -Type monsters and lorded over by  Brron . Brron's regime is opposed by  Warrior -Type rebels such as  Freed the Brave Wanderer ,  Total Defense Shogun , and  Field-Commander Rahz . The Dark World is also home to an icy area in which lower- Level  Fiends and Fairies are oppressed by mid-Level  Winged-Beasts  led by  Sky Scout . After Brron is defeated by Jaden, Jaden is in turn possessed by the demented spirit of his past life and rules as the Supreme King of the Dark World for a short time.
 The one who would lose a Duel there, were believed to have died. But they were actually sent to an empty, dark and cold dimension. As they were captured there, Yubel used to drain their energy in order to recover fully herself. This place was referred as "the hell" or "the underworld" in the Japanese version.
 
         Vellian Crowler  and  Echo  in the rocky wasteland dimension.     
 The final dimension visited, accessed through a gate in the icy area of the Dark World, is a desolate-appearing region full of imposing rocky outcroppings. Many of the more legendary monsters, such as  Exodia the Forbidden One  and the  Sacred Beasts , are kept here, heavily guarded. Yubel's castle was constructed here, and it is here that she has her final confrontation with Jaden. She divulges her connection to Brron and their plan to turn Jaden into an evil Supreme King to rule alongside Yubel. With that plan failing, Yubel attempts to Summons " Super Fusion God ", intending to fuse all twelve dimensions together and be united with Jaden in death, but is stopped by Jaden, who fuses himself with Yubel and purges her of the Light of Destruction once and for all.
 While  Honest  was explaining the upcoming threat in  episode 160 , a scene features the dimension from the second series where the Legendary Dragons were held. Honest reveals that the " World of Darkness " has appeared in one of the Duel Monster dimensions and is slowly consuming it.
 
 Yu-Gi-Oh! 5D's 
         Schwank  while it prospered.     
 In 5D's, another Duel Spirits' World is linked to Luna's mind.  Luna  lapsed into a coma at the age of three and awoke in the  Ancient Forest , where she lived among the Fairy-type monsters under the protection of  Ancient Fairy Dragon . After she woke, a great evil, the  Minus Curse , struck the Forest, imprisoning the monsters within stone and transforming the Forest into the desolate Minus World.
 
         The polluted  Ancient Forest .     
 Luna's connection to the Spirit World was reestablished during her Duel with  Professor Frank . The demented counselor put both Luna and himself into trances, allowing them to access the spirit world. Aside from monsters played by Luna or Frank, the Ancient Forest was bereft of life, and much of it was turned to stone, including Ancient Fairy Dragon, who was found fossilized in a cliff face. Luna returned to reality after the curse ended.
 Later, Luna transfers into the Spirit World again (this time body as well due to Regulus casting a spell to bring her there), this time to free it from the Minus Curse. She visits the town  Schwank , which gets invaded by the  monkey troop , searching for spirits. Joined by  Torunka , a de-aged " Dark Sage " spirit, Luna tracked down  Regulus , Ancient Fairy Dragon's servant, in the  Forest of Pojar .
 Luna, Torunka, and Regulus invaded the  castle  of  Zeman the Ape King , the chief facilitator of the Minus Curse and underling of the Dark Signer  Devack . The Minus Curse is finally lifted with Devack's defeat, and as a reward, Luna receives cards for both " Ancient Fairy Dragon " and " Regulus ".
 
 Non-canon appearances 
 Reverse of Arcadia
