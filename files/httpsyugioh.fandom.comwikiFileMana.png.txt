 Design 
       Mana's design incorporates multiple layers of clothing and a wide range of expressions. Depicted here is the young magician in full regalia from front and rear views and alongside views of her head from different angles.     
 Mana's design is based on " Dark Magician Girl ". Her standard outfit consists of a beige shoulderless, sleeveless top with ruffled straps around her upper arm, a beige miniskirt, charmed bracelets around her wrists and ankles and matching necklace, belt and headwear. The character is slender and her brown hair is sporadically arranged and juts downwards in all directions.
 
 Biography 
 Mana is a young magician in training at the  Dawn of the Duel  arc's beginning who serves the priest  Mahad . In the  Dark RPG , after Mahad's death, she swears to become a great magician and eventually is able to summon her own Ka, the " Dark Magician Girl ". Later (in the anime) when  Yugi's  gang discovers her, Yugi explains about the card game back home commenting on her resemblance to " Dark Magician Girl ". Mana later helps them to defeat  Zorc . She is one of the only two people in the World of Memories, who could see Yugi and his friends. Mana participated in the final battle against Zorc Necrophades when the latter initiated his assault on the palace. Her  ka  and Mahad attempted to destroy Zorc with a combined attack but Zorc was unaffected and easily wiped them out. Since her  ka  was destroyed, Mana fell unconscious. Fortunately, Atem regained his true name and destroyed Zorc. After Zorc's destruction, Mana saw Atem and his friends returned to the modern world and waved them goodbye. 
 The original Mana's soul was among others waiting for Atem as he passed into the afterlife.
