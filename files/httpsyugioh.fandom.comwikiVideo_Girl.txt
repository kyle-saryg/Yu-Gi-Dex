      The  Video Girl♡  VHS.     
 Video Girl♡ , known as  Hard-On❤Paradise  (ボッキン❤パラダイス,  Bokkin❤Paradaisu ) in the Japanese version, is a pornographic video  Jonouchi  had in the manga. [1] 
 Jonouchi was disappointed that some parts were censored. He squinted to try and see them through the pixelization, but failed. He promised to lend the video to  Yugi , but when he handed it to him,  Anzu  snatched it. Trying to embarrass the boys, she acted naive and asked what it was and if she should watch it. [1] 
 When Jonouchi's VHS player was repaired, he asked Yugi if he could have the video back. After reminding Yugi what video he meant, Yugi implied that  Grandpa  had taken it. [2]
