      A can of My Coffee.     
 My Coffee  is a brand of  canned coffee  in the  manga .
 Katsuya Jonouchi  bought a can of this for himself and  Cora-Cola  for  Yugi  while at the arcade. He had to keep tossing the can from hand-to-hand at first as it was too hot to stay holding. When he returned to Yugi, he found that he had been beaten-up and dropped the coffee in surprise, spilling it. [1]
