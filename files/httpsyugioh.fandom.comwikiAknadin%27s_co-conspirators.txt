 Biography 
 Aknadin explains to  Pharaoh Aknamkanon  that the  Millennium Spellbook  is the main reason for Egypt's war against its neighboring countries. If taken, the book lists spells dealing with "Shadow Alchemy" ( RenkinJyutsu ) and could provide the enemy with the ultimate power to create invincible armies and suggests they should attempt to decipher the texts themselves, as indeed they recently have had a breakthrough: they deciphered one of the spells!
 Unknown to Aknamkanon, the spell which Aknadin and the others managed to translate is a Dark Ritual allowing its caster to forge seven " Millennium Items " that could eliminate Egypt's invaders, and bring tranquility to the realm once again. What they refrained from informing the Pharaoh that in order to do so, 99 human sacrifices were required. 
 In the anime, Aknadin and the conspirators hypnotized their soldiers into forgetting their upcoming actions of massacring the  Kul Elna  citizens then have their blood, bone, and flesh melted in with the gold that was cast in the mystic rite that formed the items. In the English dub, this gory concept is replaced with the inhabitants' "spirits" were harnessed instead to complete the rite that forges the Millennium Items. Unknown to Aknadin and the conspirators, there was a  survivor  that witnessed this all. Also in the anime, the ritual's completion lead to a  dark spirit  that appeared and attacked them all while Aknadin used the  Millennium Eye  to avoid this. 
 Despite the conspirators' deaths, Aknadin returned to the palace the seven Millennium Items;  five high priests  entrusted with four Millennium Items ( Millennium Rod ,  Millennium Ring ,  Millennium Scale  and  Millennium Necklace ), the adviser  Shimon Muran  entrusted with the  Millennium Key  and Pharaoh Aknamkanon entrusted with the  Millennium Pendant  (the symbol of the pyramid).
