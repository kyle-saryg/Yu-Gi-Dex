 Featured Duel: Joey Wheeler vs. Yami Marik 
 Turn 1: Yami Marik 
Yami Marik draws " Gil Garth " and subsequently Normal Summons it (1800/1200) in  Attack Position . He then  Sets  a card ("Dark Wall of Wind").
 Turn 2: Joey Wheeler 
Joey draws "Alligator's Sword".  Joey 's  hand  contains " Scapegoat ", " Rocket Warrior ", " Graceful Dice ", " Foolish Burial ", " Baby Dragon " and " Alligator's Sword ". He then  Sets  a card and Joey  Normal Summons  "Alligator's Sword" (1500/1200) in  Defense Position .
 Turn 3: Yami Marik 
Yami Marik draws. He then  Normal Summons  " Drillago " (1600/1100) in  Attack Position . "Drillago" attacks and  destroys  "Alligator's Sword". "Gil Garth" attacks directly, but Joey activates his face-down "Scapegoat" to  Special Summon  four " Sheep Tokens " (0/0 for each) in  Defense Position . "Gil Garth" destroys a "Sheep Token".
 Turn 4: Joey Wheeler 
Joey draws " Panther Warrior " and subsequently Normal Summons it (2000/1600) in  Attack Position . He then  Tributes  a "Sheep Token" to allow "Panther Warrior" to attack. "Panther Warrior" attacks and destroys "Gil Garth" ( Marik  4000 → 3800).
 Turn 5: Yami Marik 
Yami Marik draws "Hidden Soldiers".  Marik 's hand contains " Card of Last Will ", "Tribute Burial", "Plasma Eel", "Helpoemer" and "Hidden Soldiers". Yami Marik  activates  " Tribute Burial " to  remove from play  "Alligator's Sword" from  Joey 's  Graveyard  and "Gil Garth" from his own Graveyard in order to  Normal Summon  " Helpoemer " (2000/1400) in  Attack Position  without Tributing. Yami Marik then  sets  a card.
 Turn 6: Joey Wheeler 
Joey draws " Jinzo ". He then  Normal Summons  "Rocket Warrior" (1500/1300) in  Attack Position .  Marik  then  activates  his face-down " Hidden Soldiers " to  Special Summon  " Plasma Eel " (500/1200) in  Attack Position  since Joey Normal Summoned a monster. Yami Marik activates the effect of "Plasma Eel" to equip the latter to "Panther Warrior". "Rocket Warrior" attacks "Helpoemer". Due to the effect of "Rocket Warrior", it is not destroyed and Joey takes no Battle Damage. After damage calculation, the final effect of "Rocket Warrior" reduces the ATK of "Helpoemer"  ATK  by 500 until the end of the turn ("Helpoemer": 2000 → 1500/1400). 
 Joey then  Tributes  a "Sheep Token" to allow "Panther Warrior" to attack. "Panther Warrior" attacks and destroys "Helpoemer" ( Marik  3800 → 3300). Since "Helpoemer" was sent to the  Graveyard  as a result of battle, Joey is now forced to randomly discard a card from his hand at the end of each of his  Battle Phases  so long as "Helpoemer" is in the Graveyard. At the end of the Battle Phase, the effect of "Helpoemer" forces  Joey  to discard "Jinzo".
 Joey has 4000  Life Points  remaining and controls "Panther Warrior" (2000/1600) and "Rocket Warrior" (1500/1300) in Attack Position and one " Sheep Token " (0/0) in Defense Position.
 Yami Marik has 3300 Life Points remaining and controls "Drillago" in Attack Position and "Plasma Eel" (equipped to "Panther Warrior").
 Turn 6: Joey Wheeler 
At the End Phase, the  effect  of " Plasma Eel " activates, decreasing the ATK of " Panther Warrior " by 500 ("Panther Warrior": 2000 → 1500/1600).
 Turn 7: Yami Marik 
Yami Marik draws "Coffin Seller". He then  Sets  two cards.
 Turn 8: Joey Wheeler 
Joey draws " Insect Queen ". Joey's hand contains " Graceful Dice ", "Insect Queen", " Baby Dragon ", and " Foolish Burial ". Joey then  Normal Summons  "Baby Dragon" (1200/700) in  Defense Position . " Rocket Warrior "  attacks  " Drillago ". Due to the effect of "Rocket Warrior", it is not destroyed and Joey takes no Battle Damage. After damage calculation, "Drillago" loses 500 ATK until the end of the turn due to the final effect of "Rocket Warrior" ("Drillago": 1600 → 1100/1500). 
 Marik   activates  his face-down " Card of Last Will " to  draw  five cards since one of his monsters had lost ATK.  Marik's  hand contains "Legendary Fiend", " Premature Burial ", " Relieve Monster ", " Nightmare Mirror " and " The Winged Dragon of Ra ". 
 Joey  Tributes a "Sheep Token" to allow "Panther Warrior" to attack. "Panther Warrior" attacks and  destroys  "Drillago" ( Marik  3300 → 2900). Marik activates his face-down " Coffin Seller ". Now Joey will take 300 damage each time a  monster  is  sent  to his  Graveyard . At the end of the Battle Phase, the effect of " Helpoemer " activates, forcing Joey to  discard  "Insect Queen" ( Joey  4000 → 3700). At the End Phase, the effect of "Plasma Eel" activates ("Panther Warrior": 1500 → 1000/1600).
 Turn 9: Yami Marik 
Yami Marik draws "Nightmare Wheel". He then  Sets  a card. Yami Marik then  activates  "Premature Burial" to pay 800 Life Points ( Marik  2900 → 2100) and  Special Summon  "Drillago" from his  Graveyard  (1600/1100) in Attack Position. Yami Marik then  Tributes  "Drillago" in order to  Tribute Summon  " Legendary Fiend " (1500/1800) in Attack Position.
 Turn 10: Joey Wheeler 
Joey draws " Little-Winguard ".  Marik   activates  his face-down " Nightmare Wheel " and targets "Rocket Warrior" for its effect. Now "Rocket Warrior" is forbidden from attacking while "Nightmare Wheel" is face-up and during each of Yami Marik's Standby Phases, Joey will take 500 damage.  Joey   Normal Summons  "Little-Winguard" (1400/1800) in  Defense Position  and  switches  "Panther Warrior" to  Defense Position . At the End Phase, the  effect  of "Plasma Eel" activates ("Panther Warrior": 1000 → 500/1600).
 Turn 11: Yami Marik 
Yami Marik draws "Malevolent Catastrophe". On Yami Marik's Standby Phase, the effect of "Nightmare Wheel" activates ( Joey  3700 → 3200). At the same time, the  ATK  of "Legendary Fiend" increases by 700 due to its own effect ("Legendary Fiend": 1500 → 2200/1800). "Legendary Fiend"  attacks  &  destroys  "Little-Winguard" ( Joey  3200 → 2900). Yami Marik then  Sets  " Malevolent Catastrophe ".
 Turn 12: Joey Wheeler 
Joey draws " Question " and subsequently activates it. Yami Marik must now guess the first monster that went to Joey's Graveyard. If he is right, the monster is removed from play, but if he is wrong, the monster will be Special Summoned from Joey's Graveyard. Since  Marik  cannot guess correctly (The card at the bottom of  Joey 's  Graveyard  was  discarded  by the effect of "Helpoemer"), Joey is able to  Special Summon  " Jinzo " (2400/1500) from his  Graveyard  in Attack Position. Due to the effect of "Jinzo", all Trap Cards on the field are destroyed. With "Nightmare Wheel" destroyed, "Rocket Warrior" is released from its effect. 
 Joey then  switches  "Baby Dragon" and "Panther Warrior" to  Attack Position . "Jinzo"  attacks  and destroys "Legendary Fiend" ( Marik  2100 → 1900). "Baby Dragon" and "Rocket Warrior" attack directly, but Marik activates his face-down " Dark Wall of Wind " to prevent himself from taking any Battle Damage from direct attacks this turn. At the end of the Battle Phase, the effect of "Helpoemer" activates, forcing Joey to  discard  "Foolish Burial". At the End Phase, the effect of "Plasma Eel" activates ("Panther Warrior": 500 → 0/1600).
 Turn 13: Yami Marik 
Yami Marik draws "Lava Golem". He then  Tributes  "Jinzo" and "Baby Dragon" in order to  Special Summon  " Lava Golem " (3000/2500) to  Joey 's side of the  field  in Attack Position. Yami Marik then  Sets  a card.
 Joey has 2900  Life Points  remaining and controls "Panther Warrior" (0/1600), "Rocket Warrior" (1500/1300), and "Lava Golem" (3000/2500) in Attack Position.
 Yami Marik has 1900 Life Points remaining and controls "Plasma Eel" (equipped to "Panther Warrior") and one set card.
 Turn 14: Joey Wheeler 
Joey draws " Gamble ". " Lava Golem " attacks directly, but Marik activates his face-down " Relieve Monster " to return " Plasma Eel " to his hand. After that resolves, Yami Marik uses the second effect of "Relieve Monster" to  Special Summon  "Plasma Eel" (500/1200) in  Defense Position  and use it to intercept the attack. "Plasma Eel" isn't destroyed as it can't be destroyed in battle. At the end of the Battle Phase, the effect of " Helpoemer " activates from Marik's  Graveyard , forcing Joey to discard "Gamble". At the End Phase, the effect of "Lava Golem" activates, inflicting 700 damage to Joey ( Joey  2900 → 2200).
 Turn 15: Yami Marik 
Marik draws " Machine Duplication " and subsequently activates it to target "Plasma Eel" and  Special Summon  two more "Plasma Eels" (500/1200 for both) in Attack Position. Yami Marik then activates the effects of two "Plasma Eels", equipping those "Plasma Eels" onto Joey's " Rocket Warrior " and "Lava Golem". Yami Marik then Sets a card.
 Turn 16: Joey Wheeler 
Joey draws "Gilford the Lightning". He then activates " Graceful Dice " to roll a die and multiply the ATK of "Plasma Eel" by the result. Joey gets a six ("Plasma Eel": 500 → 3000/1200). Since the ATK of "Plasma Eel" now exceeds 500, "Machine Duplication" and the two "Plasma Eels" that are Equip Cards are destroyed, freeing Joey's monsters. Joey then Tributes " Panther Warrior ", "Rocket Warrior", and "Lava Golem" in order to Tribute Summon " Gilford the Lightning " (2800/1400) in Attack Position. Since "Gilford the Lightning" was Tribute Summoned by Tributing three monsters, its effect activates, destroying all of Marik's monsters. 
 "Gilford the Lightning" attacks directly, but Marik activates his face-down " Nightmare Mirror " to negate the attack, inflict 1000 damage to Joey ( Joey  2200 → 1200) and allow Marik to discard the " The Winged Dragon of Ra " from his hand. At the end of the Battle Phase, "Helpoemer's" effect activates from the Graveyard, but Joey discards nothing as he has no cards in his hand.
 Turn 17: Yami Marik 
Yami Marik draws " Monster Reborn " and subsequently activates it to revive "The Winged Dragon of Ra" (?/?) in Attack Position. Marik then transforms "The Winged Dragon of Ra" into " Egyptian God Phoenix " (0/0).
 Joey has 1200  Life Points  remaining and controls "Gilford the Lightning" (2800/1400) in Attack Position.
 Yami Marik has 1900 Life Points remaining and controls "The Winged Dragon of Ra" (?/?) in its "Egyptian God Phoenix" mode.
 Turn 17: Yami Marik 
Yami Marik has just transformed " The Winged Dragon of Ra " into " Egyptian God Phoenix ". Yami Marik then  activates  one  effect  of "Egyptian God Phoenix" to pay 1000 Life Points ( Marik  1900 → 900) and attack and destroy " Gilford the Lightning ". Due to this being a  Shadow Game , Joey takes a lot of damage, but is still standing. At the End Phase, "Egyptian God Phoenix"  returns  to Marik's  Graveyard  under "The Winged Dragon of Ra" form, due to its effect.
 Turn 18: Joey Wheeler 
Joey draws " Gearfried the Iron Knight " and subsequently Normal Summons it (1800/1600) in Attack Position. He then attempts to declare an attack, but due to his condition, he collapses before successfully declaring it.
 As Joey can't continue the Duel, Yami Marik wins by default.
 Epilogue 
Despite losing a  Shadow Game ,  Joey 's mind battles the shadows and resists being banished to the  Shadow Realm . He nonetheless remains unconscious and is taken away for medical attention (This is possibly due to Marik not meeting any winning conditions, with Joey just collapsing in order for Marik to win and both of them still having Life Points beforehand. However, it is also possible that he is only in a coma because of his strong friendship bond with both Yugi and Yami Yugi protecting him; this bond can be proven to be so strong and the possible answer he wasn't in the shadows because when Tristan drags him from the medical bed up to the window of the room to see Yugi's Duel  with Kaiba in the semi-finals,  claiming Yugi needs him, Joey awakens in order to cheer for Yugi at the very end of his Duel.)
 Marik, on the other hand, also suffers from the Shadow Game.
 
 Aftermath 
 Joey has fallen and Yami Marik wins by default. Everyone, including his own sister  Serenity Wheeler  is shocked to see Joey fall. Serenity is heartbroken. Yami Yugi blames himself for not being able to stop this, suddenly, with the power of Ishizu's Millennium Necklace, he sees himself and Joey dueling. A probable vision of the future. There was no time to interpret the vision, as his semi-final battle with Seto Kaiba is next.
