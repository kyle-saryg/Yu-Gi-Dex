 Junk Warrior 
 Well he also uses "Speed Warrior" in nearly all his Duels and I don't think that's a Signature Card. --  Deltaneos  ( talk ) 19:45, 29 November 2008 (UTC)
 
 Putting " Speed Warrior " as  Yusei's  signature card is like putting " Avian " and " Burstinatrix " as  Jaden's  signature cards  Blackstone Dresden  18:41, 6 December 2008 (UTC) 
 I'm saying that "Junk Warrior" should be excluded for that reason. The person who added "Junk Warrior" said it should be there because Yusei used it in most of his Duels. --  Deltaneos  ( talk ) 19:15, 6 December 2008 (UTC) 
 Maybe, but Junk Warrior made Yusei won most of his duels, even when he had Stardust Dragon.  Rayqui  19:31, 6 December 2008 (UTC) 
 I think Delta's getting Junk Warrior and Junk Synchron confused  Blackstone Dresden  19:56, 6 December 2008 (UTC) 
 No, I mean "Junk Warrior". This just seems to be a matter of taste. In my opinion a character should only have one signature card (or cards if its a group like Sacred Beasts or Ojama Trio) at a given instance. That being one that's most recognised as belonging to that character, not their necessarily used in the majority of their Duels. Some may use it as a measure of last resort or save for special occassions, in which case Yusei did with "Stardust Dragon". Although then you could argue that "Junk Warrior" was Yusei's signature card before he got "Stardust Dragon" back... But I wouldn't say so, since at the time, the story revolved around him getting "Stardust Dragon" back. So "Stardust Dragon" was more important to him than "Junk Warrior" at this time. --  Deltaneos  ( talk ) 12:42, 9 December 2008 (UTC) 
 Should I mention that, right before and after advertising moments during the Japanese anime, Yusei appears along with Junk Warrior, which also appears fighting Jack's Red Dragon Archfiend in the first 5D's opening, and made appearances in all others openings with the exception of Cross Game ? Plus, the article says "one particular card a duelist uses [...] in almost all their Duels", and Junk Warrior was played by Yusei in [b]all[/b] his duels, was Yusei's first main monster to be revealed. Still not enough ?  Rayqui  20:43, 9 December 2008 (UTC) 
 All those points prove it's one of Yusei's popular cards. They don't indicate it's his signature card. And yes the article says that they use their signature card in nearly all their Duels. Read my last comment and you'll see that I don't agree with that. It may be true in a lot of cases but not always. Addressing when you said,  "Was his first main monster to be revealed" , defining what a "main monster" is, is more tedious than defining what a signature card is. And being the first is no proof that it's a signature card. --  Deltaneos  ( talk ) 00:16, 11 December 2008 (UTC) 
 By "main monster", I meant a bit of "strongest monster", but also first "woah-take-a-look-at-this-powerful-monster-with-unbeliveable-abilities-which-make-me-win-the-very-first-duel-of-the-anime". I dare say Junk Warrior is to Yusei what E-Hero Flame Wingman is to Jaden, like Nitro Warrior is Yusei's Thunder Giant, Stardust Dragon being his Neos, etc. It plays a major role in his duels.  Rayqui  18:55, 11 December 2008 (UTC) 
 This seems to just be a matter of taste. Would a vote be the best option? --  Deltaneos  ( talk ) 18:06, 12 December 2008 (UTC)
 
 Sure, why not ?  Rayqui  19:16, 12 December 2008 (UTC)
 Um, Junk Warrior is in the goddamn eyecatch.  I think it's fair to say it's Yusei's signature.  Danny Lilithborne  11:00, 5 February 2009 (UTC) 
 Also, ... 
 ... why did Hunter Pace and others got removed ?  Rayqui  20:46, 9 December 2008 (UTC)
 
 We've only seen them use those cards once and haven't heard of any other connections with them elsewhere. There's not enough evidence to say they are their signature cards. --  Deltaneos  ( talk ) 00:19, 11 December 2008 (UTC) 
 In the first episode of the anime, Hunter Pace is known for his "Skull Flames combo", and yet Skull Flames appears in all his duels too. Doesn't that makes it his Signature Card ? I think Hunter Pace has more reason to be in this section that Mr.Armstrong and Iron Chain Dragon.  Rayqui  18:55, 11 December 2008 (UTC) 
 Armstrong and "Iron Chain Dragon" were removed at the same time as Hunter Pace and "Skull Flames". Although I hadn't noticed Hunter's had been changed to "Skull Flames". I thought it was still at "Speed King ☆ Skull Flames". I agree that "Skull Flames" was the Signature card of his Skull of Fire Deck and quite possibly his Signature Card overall. I won't argue if that's re-added. --  Deltaneos  ( talk ) 19:50, 11 December 2008 (UTC) 
 'k, re-added then.  Rayqui  18:04, 12 December 2008 (UTC) 
 Fortune Ladies/Fairies. 
 Those are Carly's Deck theme, not signature cards.  Diehard Guy  10:15, 5 February 2009 (UTC)
 
 Non-pedantic differences being?  Danny Lilithborne  10:57, 5 February 2009 (UTC) 
 If/when Carly/D Carly starts to favor a specific Fortune Telling Witch/Fortune Lady above the rest, that could be called her signature card. Otherwise it would be like putting "Morphtronics" as Leo's signature cards  —This unsigned comment was made by  75.104.172.139  ( talk  •  contribs ) 20:12, 21 March 2009 (UTC) 
 In that case, then Carly's ace monsters should be either Fortune Lady Earth (her 2nd duel supported Earth a lot, and Earth resembles Carly and her nature of trying to keep up with Jack (Lady Earth power up every standby phase)) or Fortune Lady Light -- Rockmanmegaman  ( talk  •  contribs ) 17:20, January 4, 2012 (UTC)
 
 Ra 
 Would Ra really be a signature card to Yu-Gi? I mean at least from the episode's I saw (which isn't all of them) Yu-Gi uses Obelsik and Slifer a lot more. And even when he does use Ra he doesn't use Ra to it's full potential.-- Blueyeyesawesomedragon  15:17, 15 March 2009 (UTC)
 
 Removing the list 
 Considering there are so many questionable "signature cards" and there seems to be some sort of arguement over many inclusions, could we just forget the list altogether? We could keep 2 or 3 unarguable examples (eg. Kaiba - Blue-Eyes White Dragon) to give the reader an idea of what a signature card is. --  Deltaneos  ( talk ) 09:31, 2 June 2009 (UTC)
 
 Should we maybe add... 
 Should we add Celfon (Leo) and Speed Warrior (Yusei)?  Vehicroidsrage  00:07, 22 August 2009 (UTC)
 
 Wisel's owner 
 Shouldn't we have Piccaco (I problibly pronounced it wrong) instead of or in additon to Ghost for Machine Emperor Wisel?  After all it was his card that he "lent" to Ghost.  Azure Knight-Zeo  18:38, September 2, 2009 (UTC)
 
 
 Maybe we could... 
 I was thinking maybe we could add Pharaoh Atem.  You know, like say his signature cards are the 3 Egyptian Gods and the Creator of Light?  —This unsigned comment was made by  Novafan365  ( talk  •  contribs ) 03:59, 20 October 2009 (UTC) 
 
 Yeah I think so, only the "Egyptian Counterparts" could summon the Divine-Beasts, and only the true pharaoh (knowing his/her name) could summon Horakhty. -- Bluemoonwhitenight  04:14, October 20, 2009 (UTC) 
 But he never used them as cards. He didn't use any cards for that matter, unless you count his time as  Yami Yugi  or video games. He had cards in FMR, but not the Egyptian Gods. --  Deltaneos  ( talk ) 11:26, October 20, 2009 (UTC) 
 Signature Archetype 
 Maybe we could expand this into a signature archtype page. For example:
 Yusei Fudo:  Junk  &  Warriors , 
Zane Truesdale:  Cyber  &  Cyberdarks , 
Seto Kaiba:  Blue-Eyes , 
Yugi Muto:  Dark Magicians ,  Egyptian Gods  &  Kuribohs , 
Jaden Yuki:  Elemental Heroes 
etc . . .
-- Bluemoonwhitenight  12:08, November 28, 2009 (UTC)
 I agree but I am not sure if all the characters have a signature archetype
 
 Judai's E-Hero Neos... 
 I noticed that his ace monster - Neos, still has Season 2 - ? on that list, should that be fixing or leave? -- FredCat100  ( talk  •  contribs ) 17:22, August 2, 2010 (UTC)
 I kind ofagree with deltaneos above. The character's signiature cards aren't really hard core facts it's just observations 9so-to-speak) of cards they use often. Maybe just  1  card per character is enough.  Yug18-11  ( talk  •  contribs ) 14:30, August 14, 2010 (UTC)
 
 The problem is that we list cards for EVERY character, even characters that have a single duel. I think this sort of encourages longer lists for characters we see more often. Most characters really do have a single signature card though. Judai/Jaden is really the exception. Flame Wingman was clearly signature during Season 1, while Neos was for the rest of the series. I think most would agree that Dark Magician is indisputably Yugi's signature, and the Stardust Dragon is for Yusei. Jaden's is more complicated.  Cheesedude  ( talk  •  contribs ) 23:22, August 14, 2010 (UTC) 
 Wouldn't we also want to include Terra Firma, as that was his for the manga.  Yusei also has Lightning Warrior for the Manga.
 True.  Cheesedude  ( talk  •  contribs ) 04:00, August 15, 2010 (UTC) 
 Now like Cheesedude said, Jaden's is more complitcated.  Now, the way I see it, there's a tie between Winged Kuriboh and Elemental Hero Neos. -- Novafan365  ( talk  •  contribs ) 14:36, October 5, 2010 (UTC)
 
 Recycle of Add and Remove 
 I am little irritated that you kept put all cards that are not really main cards in those list ever Delt and I still said no. What's a problem with you, unregistered user? -- F red C at   T.P.  •  F.R.  •  J.R.  22:42, August 16, 2010 (UTC)
 
 I agree that they shouldn't be added, but I don't believe that "those shows are over" is a valid argument.  Cheesedude  ( talk  •  contribs ) 22:46, August 16, 2010 (UTC)

should little yugi not have gandora as one of his signatures?
 
 Proposal 
 I think this page should be  completely  revamped. Characters that appear only once or twice should not be listed. Any signature cards that remain should be cited. There are plenty of episodes in which a character specifically identifies a card as their "ace" or "favorite". If we cite this, it will take away a lot of ambiguity in what a signature card is. Some manga chapters have the same thing. This would prune the list considerably, and citing a source is never a bad thing, right?  Cheesedude  ( talk  •  contribs ) 14:47, March 29, 2011 (UTC)
 
 It may also help to have separate sections for the anime and the manga (there's probably little difference for major characters, but I'd imagine minor characters have their cards changed pretty often when going between the two).  「 ダイノ ガイ 千？！ 」 ?  ·  ☎ Dinoguy1000  16:12, March 29, 2011 (UTC)
 I would agree. For the original manga, the signature cards should be mostly the same, but there's plenty of anime-only characters. In GX and 5D's, the signature cards are utterly different. Same setting and characters with different stories and Decks..  Cheesedude  ( talk  •  contribs ) 16:59, March 29, 2011 (UTC) 
 There have been no objections, but there has been lots of edit warring. I'm going to attempt to revamp the page completely tonight.  Cheesedude  ( talk  •  contribs ) 17:53, June 23, 2011 (UTC) 
 It would be great if you put a reference(s) where possible. -- 91.150.120.7  ( talk ) 21:21, June 23, 2011 (UTC) 
 While I agree to a certain extent, this is one thing we probably shouldn't get too hung up on references over.  「 ダイノ ガイ 千？！ 」 ?  ·  ☎ Dinoguy1000  23:16, June 23, 2011 (UTC) 
 I will put references where I can. Expect the GX to section to references better than the others, since I know more about that series than the others. If anyone else can add any references that I don't add, I would appreciate it. I'm going to consider any time a character references a card as their "favorite card" or "ace card" proof enough that it's a signature (actually, maybe we should move this article to "ace card").  Cheesedude  ( talk  •  contribs ) 23:59, June 23, 2011 (UTC) 
 What if a character considers a card as the best one in their Deck? Does that kind of a statement count as a "favorite card" or an "ace card" -- 178.223.135.236  ( talk ) 07:10, June 24, 2011 (UTC) 
 Not necessarily, it depends on how they say it. If, for example, they're just making an objective statement (something along the lines of " X  is the strongest monster in my deck"), it's not evidence that that card is their favorite/ace. An emotional attachment to a particular card, on the other hand, is a much stronger indicator that said card is their favorite/ace.  「 ダイノ ガイ 千？！ 」 ?  ·  ☎ Dinoguy1000  07:19, June 24, 2011 (UTC) 
 An emotional attachment to a particular card, on the other hand, is a much stronger indicator that said card is their favorite/ace.
 
 If an emotional attachment can be considered as a condition, should we add cards which a character finds it "precious" in terms of a presentation i.e. a symbol of a particular bond or relationship with an another character? For example, Syrus' "Power Bond" is a symbol of the bond with his brother Zane, Atticus' "Swing of Memories" - his bond with Alexis, Alexis' "Doble Passé" - her bond with Jaden etc. -- 79.101.212.197  ( talk ) 13:49, June 28, 2011 (UTC) 
 Again, not necessarily. Those all sound like cases where the card is just representative of the relationships between those characters - closer to a mascot than an ace.  「 ダイノ ガイ 千？！ 」 ?  ·  ☎ Dinoguy1000  15:27, June 28, 2011 (UTC) 
 If a favorite card is considered as a condition, should we list idol cards i.e. card crushes or just avoid them? -- 178.223.177.81  ( talk ) 21:19, July 1, 2011 (UTC) 
 The same questions for "important" and "valuable" cards. Should we list all that cards or just those in terms of being precious to character, not being the strongest or rare ones in their Decks. 
 I'll list them here in case they are needed later. -- 178.223.177.81  ( talk ) 00:02, July 2, 2011 (UTC) 
 Episode 2 - Alexis calls "Flame Wingman" Jaden's most important card. 
 Episode 11 - A flashback shows that "Power Bond" is an important card to Syrus as he was a gift of hos brother. 
 Episode 16 - Syrus states "Winged Kuriboh" is a valuable card. 
 Episode 56 - Jaden calls Syrus' "Power Bond" a valuable and memorable card. 
 Episodes 165 and 166 - "Destiny End Dragon" is an important card to Aster. 
 Episode 173 - Atticus calls "Red-Eyes B. Dragon" an important card. 
 Episode 178 - As Jaden makes his speech, he holds an important card to him ("Neos"), as well as his friends (Chazz - "Ojama Yellow", Syrus - "Power Bond", Alexis - "Doble Passe"). 
 I think that's a bit nebulous. In the case of Winged Kuriboh, I believe Sho was saying the card itself is valuable, since in the anime-verse it's a very rare card. The same can be said for Destiny End Dragoon, since it was one of a kind and commissioned by the Senrigan Group for what was probably a ridiculous sum of money. So both those cases are not using "important" in a sentential way. Also, I don't think any given card needs more than two or three references.  Cheesedude  ( talk  •  contribs ) 00:14, July 2, 2011 (UTC) 
 "Redundant" section header names 
 There are several reasons having the redundancy in the individual manga/anime section headers is preferable to not having them:
 
 Linking is much simpler - it's far easier to remember how to link  Signature card#Yu-Gi-Oh! 5D's anime  then it is  Signature card#Anime 2 . 
 The needed link with the shorter headers changes if the order is changed, or if headers of the same name are added or removed - for example, if the first YGO section gets split into anime and manga subsections, the link to the ZEXAL manga section changes from "Manga 3" to "Manga 4", and all instances have to be updated accordingly. 
 People being linked to a specific subsection can tell immediately what the context for the information is, without having to find the next-higher-level header or play detective based on the information in the table. 
 This is one case where a little bit of redundancy is actually more useful than not having it. -- Dinoguy1000  ( talk   •   contribs ) as  208.124.74.56  ( talk ) 16:12, August 15, 2011 (UTC)

 As far as the headers go, why not just split up the headers more and not have anything in subheaders. In other words, have separate level two headers for both the anime and manga.  Cheesedude  ( talk  •  contribs ) 16:17, August 15, 2011 (UTC)

 Zexal anime 
 This seriously needs to stop. Over and over again people are adding people like  Kakeru Kunitachi ,  Housaku Yasai  and  Shobee Yuatsu , but they only dueled once so they should not be listed. They should only really be added if the character said personally what there ace card was.  86.15.144.198  ( talk ) 22:28, November 28, 2011 (UTC)

 Genome Heriter on Tron 
 Seriously, Tron only dueled once and i dont think he mentioned Genome Heriter is his ace but DalekSupreme is still adding it. Did Tron actually mention that it was his ace? ---- SharkTenjo  12:20, June 15, 2012 (UTC)
 
 Maybe he wanted to hide it, so can people don't figure out away to defeat it.-- Laggia   Will Lag You ( Talk )  12:35, June 15, 2012 (UTC) 
 right now tro has only dueled once, but he is a recurring character, so i listed what is his most likely signature for now. we did the same thing with gauche until his later duels. if he uses a card in a future duel that is most likely his signature card then im okay with changing it but until then please leave it alone. DalekSupreme13  ( talk  •  contribs ) 12:56, June 15, 2012 (UTC) 
 But Gauche changed decks, because he needed to get stronger to defeat Yuma. We have to wait for Tron's next duels to see if Genome Heriter is in fact his Signature Card. Laggia   Will Lag You ( Talk )  15:13, June 15, 2012 (UTC) 
 Majestic Red Dragon 
 I think that Majestic Red Dragon should be listed as a signature card for jack as it was key to winning his duels with carly and imposter jack. its relationship to jack is the same as majestic star's is to yusei. jack is also the only one who can summon it and healso gains all of the signer mark when he summons it just like yusei does when he summons majestic star.

 Mr. Kay 
 Mr. Kay makes more than one appearance in the zexal anime, each being a seperate plot rather then being one story spread over multiple episodes. because of this i believe he deserves to be on the list. DalekSupreme13  ( talk  •  contribs ) 09:24, June 17, 2012 (UTC)
 
 Though he only dueled ONCE. For me, i think that Crashbug X is his signature card if he's added cause its his signature virus. Though he cant be added cause of the rules so.. -- SharkTenjo 
 how can he not be added, he has appeared more than once in the show as part of 2 unrelated plots. once in his first appearance when he was possessed by his number and his second was when he help yuma and his friends find kite's hideout. so he isn't a oneshot character.

 just because he only duels once doesn't mean hes a one shot. prince ojin, dartz, and fujiwara only duel once but they aren't one shots. whats makes him different. DalekSupreme13  ( talk  •  contribs ) 18:18, August 31, 2012 (UTC) 
 Do his cards displaying other than his only duel? Nope - that don't make him added in. One-Shot = 1 duel once and that's it. -- i F r e d C a t  21:28, August 31, 2012 (UTC) 
 Anna's Rocket Arrow Express 
 I personally think Rocket Arrow Express should be considered one of her signature cards just as much, if not more so than Gustav Max. Thus far, its the only card she has used in both of her duels, and in the 3rd opening, it appears behind her making it associated with her more so.
 
 III 
 i think that Number 6: OOPArts Atlanthal should be added as a key card for 3 as it triggers a transformation when he plays. DalekSupreme13  ( talk  •  contribs ) 08:57, June 18, 2012 (UTC)
 
 If a card is used only once, the answer is no, unless the character specifically calls it his "ace monster" or "key card".  Cheesedude  ( talk  •  contribs ) 16:17, June 18, 2012 (UTC) 
 Number 32 
 number 32b and number c32 should be added as key cards for shark. it states on the shark's decks page that after he recieved c32, he changed his deck to focus around the number 32 and its chaos form. also, besides yuma, shark is the only other person who can summon a chaos number which  would fall under the category of signature cards that neos and ayers rock sunrise fall under as only he can summon number c32. also, he has used both cards twice, in his duels with IV and Yuma. DalekSupreme13  ( talk  •  contribs ) 09:04, July 17, 2012 (UTC)
 
 Yuma said  Black Ray Lancer  is Shark's ace. He only use the Numbers because Tron controlled him.  Dunkles Magiermädchen  ( talk  •  contribs ) 12:55, July 17, 2012 (UTC) 
 Black Ray Lancer was his previous ace. And besides, even if he was only using it because he was controlled, using card because they're possessed is apparently a good enough reason to list it considering many of the other cards listed on the article, such as the Earthbound Immortals and other examples. 
 i agree and to be fair he didn't fall under trons control until he unlocked the power to perform a chaos xyz summon. when he first summoned number 32 in his duel with IV he wasn't controlled yet. so you really can only say that c32 is his ace while possessed by tron.

 Paradox 
 i think the malefic archtype as a whole should be listed as paradox's signature cards. the same way we did the meklords for aporia. he doesn't really show favortism to any one malefic card, but every card in the archtype is unique to him like neos and ayers rock cards.

 Yeah but, " Malefic Paradox Dragon " does seem to be the climatic card which is saved until last. That is the strongest  Malefic  monster. -- Super Sponge!!   16:10, July 17, 2012 (UTC) 
 nothe strongest would be  Malefic Truth Dragon . he even fused with it in the samee way yami marik fuses with ra. DalekSupreme13  ( talk  •  contribs ) 17:27, July 17, 2012 (UTC) 
 Signature for Video Game Characters?! 
 Is it really necessary to add Video Game Characters and with their Signature card? With this 
we have to add ALL of the characters together to which video game they appear. Also can we really identify which is their signature card in video games as it directly depends on what they draw not to what they focus to do. Also the "signature card" page is for the listing of anime characters so the video game characters arent really necessary ---- SharkTenjo  10:21, August 30, 2012 (UTC)
 
 Most usually, Video Game characters get their ace card(s) by Destiny Draw. -- i F r e d C :::: a t  10:31, August 30, 2012 (UTC) 
 But still.. The signature card page is supposed to be canon ---- SharkTenjo  12:33, August 31, 2012 (UTC) 
 And? Many games you're commenting are not. -- i F r e d C a t  13:02, August 31, 2012 (UTC) 
 Thats my point, they are not canon. Also what video games are am i commenting?---- SharkTenjo  13:24, August 31, 2012 (UTC) 
 So you're ask to removing them after all? -- i F r e d C a t  14:20, August 31, 2012 (UTC) 
 okay, if we aren't going to count video games then why do we still list te duelist of the roses characters? they are only appear in that game and have no connection to the anime except that they are video game versions of characters from the anime, so if we aren't goin to count video game exclusive characters then they need to be removed too. DalekSupreme13  ( talk  •  contribs ) 17:30, August 31, 2012 (UTC) 
 Are we ordering to keep that in? Feel free removing them as you wish. -- i F r e d C a t  17:33, August 31, 2012 (UTC) 
 Cinco 
 okay, since it is unlikely that cinco will return in the near future, i think it would be safe now to list him now with number 9 as his signature as that was the card his strategy focused around in his duel with kite and it is the only time he has duel. just to get this out of the way, yes he has only dueled once but he isn't a oneshot character as he has made numerous appearences in the world duel carnival arc. DalekSupreme13  ( talk  •  contribs ) 17:40, August 31, 2012 (UTC)
 
 Well were not supposed to add one-shot characters OR characters who dueled once or twice without them saying that its their signature card. So still no. And i think V will return in the near future, but not using Number 9 so still he is not supposed to be here ---- SharkTenjo  01:49, September 1, 2012 (UTC) 
 in the 3rd yugioh zexal opening soul drive, we see quatro and cinco with their signature cards destyiny leo and dyson sphere. this is further evidence to support that number 9 is his signature in yugioh zexal. yes i agree that he wil probably return in zexal 2 with a new signature but for zexal his signature is number 9. when he appears in zexal 2 and if he isn't a one shot character in that series we can add his signature for that series to the future zexal 2 section. DalekSupreme13  ( talk  •  contribs ) 10:55, September 9, 2012 (UTC) 
 All we have to do is wait. For the mean time, we must not add him ---- SharkTenjo  11:27, September 9, 2012 (UTC) 
 Bandit Keith 
 for yugioh r bandit keith's signature is wicked eraser as his deck in that manga is focused around getting material out to sacrifice for wicked eraser. this is shown in his duel with joey and it is the card he used to beat richie. DalekSupreme13  ( talk  •  contribs ) 17:40, August 31, 2012 (UTC)
 
 Zexal Weapons 
 the zexal weapons shopuld be listed as signature cards for yuma/astral as they are the only ones who can use them, they are tied to te shows plot, yuma/astral has the archetype in 3 major duels (kite, tres, and vetrix), and yuma actually held one of the zexal weapons in weapon form and used it to save vetrix. DalekSupreme13  ( talk  •  contribs ) 10:13, September 4, 2012 (UTC)
 
 Its not in the rules that cards which are unique to the duelist will automatically be its ace card. ZWs are in the same manner as the Chrysalis and Neo-Spacians to Jaden. Only support to their ace so no means no ---- SharkTenjo  09:56, September 6, 2012 (UTC) 
 Shark 
 submersible carrier aero shark should be listed as a signature card for shark. prior to his first duel with yuma, his deck focused on summoning aero shark and using its strength and abilitys to swiftly win duels. it is how he defeated bronk and it is how he intended to defeat yuma until he was possessed by number 17. even after adding black ray lancer to his deck to counter yuma and other number users with, aero shatk was still his go to xyz monster up until he aquired C39. he has used this monster to win duels more times then black ray lancer and number 32 combined. it is basically shark's equivilent of junk warrior.

 If he ever called it my "ace card" or something or along those lines, add it with a reference. If not, then no, it should not be added.  Cheesedude  ( talk  •  contribs ) 14:22, September 9, 2012 (UTC) 
 Yu-Gi-Oh! R 
 Shouldn't we separate the signature cards of YGO R to the "Yu-Gi-Oh!" section as unlike the other series, their respective manga has a separate section ---- SharkTenjo  11:40, September 9, 2012 (UTC)
 
 Yes.  Cheesedude  ( talk  •  contribs ) 14:22, September 9, 2012 (UTC) 
 Can anyone do it? ---- SharkTenjo  09:29, September 11, 2012 (UTC)
 
 Signature Card =/= Ace Card 
 I think they should be different pages or at least take away the "signature card" bit. Even if a card is signature, it doesn't necessarily mean it's their ace. For example, signature cards for Yusei would include Sonic Chick, Quillbolt Hedgehog and Speed Warrior as he uses them a lot and is known for using them. Whereas ace cards would be stuff like Stardust. Ryoga and Big Jaws or Jack with Mad Archfiend/Twin-Sword Marauder are other examples. What does anyone else think?  TheScarecrow14  ( talk  •  contribs ) 12:39, October 1, 2012 (UTC)
 
 This was known since Judai and his Elemental HERO Neos. It's also "Favorite =/= Ace" compromise. -- i F r e d C a t  13:49, October 1, 2012 (UTC) 
 Judai has called "Neos" his ace many times and his deck revolves around it post-season 2; therefore it's natural that it'd be listed as an ace. But stuff like "Sonic Chick" for Yusei isn't an ace, but it's one of his signature cards.  TheScarecrow14  ( talk  •  contribs ) 14:02, October 3, 2012 (UTC) 
 Sonic Chick is just used to support his deck much like using Monster Reborn and other staples in our decks as support. Also in this article, Signature card = Ace = Favorite ---- SharkTenjo  14:24, October 3, 2012 (UTC) 
 How is Sonic Chick anything like Monster Reborn? And you told me exactly what I know already... And again, I will repeat myself... Something being signature, doesn't mean it's an ace, hence my idea of separation or removal of the term "signature card".  TheScarecrow14  ( talk  •  contribs ) 13:18, October 4, 2012 (UTC) 
 
 
 C73 
 The argument to remove it is 100% pointless. Who ****ing cares if he only used it once? 
Utopia Roots was only used once. C9 was only used once. C88/40/15/6 were only used /once/. That doesnt stop them from being signature cards. Upgraded versions of signature cards are always signature cards themselves. Otherwise Shooting Quasar Dragon, or every single chaos number in existence wouldn't be signature cards. :/ -- DysonSlinky  ( talk  •  contribs ) 00:14, March 6, 2014 (UTC)
 
 And if it was used once, it should not be listed, period. So none of those examples should be here, at all. Prior established consensus was that a card must be used more than once.  Cheesedude  ( talk  •  contribs ) 00:29, March 6, 2014 (UTC) 
 Alright I admit you got me there. Not trying to be a massive you-know-what about this but don't you think if they wanted it as a signature card of his they would of had him evolve it before he got his Over-Hundred-Number and not after?

 View Source 
 Why was this page put on View Source only? --StephenWalker97 22:14, March 26, 2014 (UTC)
 Cheesedude put it like that because of my little argument with DysonSlinky about whether or not to put Number C73 as a signature card for Shark. I don't know when people are going to be able to edit the page again. Sorry about that. --Masternumberhunter3917 8:06, March 26, 2014 (UTC)

 Should Bloom Prima the Melodious Choir be added to Zuzu's section? I would do it myself if I knew how to do it properly lol.  Yeeeeeah! Now it's a party!  ( talk  •  contribs ) 17:44, November 15, 2015 (UTC)
 
 Cites 
 Correct if I'm wrong, but if we're supposed to add citations to the edits, why are a number of cards lists are uncited. I'm certain that the characters have more ace or favorite cards than the just the ones listed. Plus, there are a few characters who duel or have cards, yet their aren't listed. Please excuse my last edits, but I know some of them have more aces. MCN51FJ  ( talk  •  contribs ) 06:15, February 6, 2016 (UTC)
 
 Cites are added just when a monster is specifically stated to be an ace. There's other monsters that are also definitively ace monsters, but never stated as such.  Sanokal K-T  ( talk  •  contribs ) 06:24, February 6, 2016 (UTC) 
 Actually, only monsters with citations should be listed, period. 
 I need to update this page with the anime card links and when I do, I'll be removing all uncited cards (unless I myself can cite them).  Cheesedude  ( talk  •  contribs ) 06:35, February 6, 2016 (UTC) 
 Minor Appearances/Conjecture 
 For the original series, the criteria for characters appearing in the first two arcs seem pretty straightforward (not anime-exclusive). Most have had notable appearances within the series, as well as in other media where their signature cards are pretty well cemented.
 Though when it comes to characters not confined to that list, it gets a bit iffy. I'm seeing a lot of characters where only their strongest card is put as their signature card, which isn't necessarily the case. Simply citing the episode it appeared in doesn't really say much aside from the fact that the character did use the card.
 I'd say that most character info on the list from season 4 should be the first to go (aside from the Legendary Dragons) due to the one-note nature of the duels and how most of the "signature cards" are only the characters' strongest cards. I think there's probably enough justification for Guardian Eatos for Rafael, though. Deck Master cards also aren't necessarily signature cards either. - SlashMan  ( talk  •  contribs ) 01:53, June 20, 2016 (UTC)
