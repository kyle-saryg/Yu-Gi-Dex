 Summary 
 The first chapter of the manga takes place some time after  Jaden Yuki 's entrance into  Duel Academy  as a result of defeating  Vellian Crowler . He has already met and befriended  Alexis Rhodes  and  Syrus Truesdale .
 Teacher candidate  Mr. Ryuga  must defeat 50 students to qualify as a teacher next year at Duel Academy. Jaden hears about this from Alexis and also that the teacher has been  taking cards from students that he defeats . Jaden finds Syrus, who has lost to Ryuga, and Ryuga took one of his cards.
 Ryuga speaks with Crowler, who seems to hold him in high regard, and reveals that he intends to take control of the Academy and use his influence to control the dueling world. Jaden confronts Ryuga about his taking the losers' cards, and Ryuga claims that Syrus willingly gave him the card, and suggests that Jaden give him his cards. Jaden harshly criticizes Ryuga as someone who is not worthy to be called a duelist, and Ryuga declares that he will have him expelled if he is hired. Crowler then comes in and proposes that Jaden duel Ryuga.
 Jaden initially struggles against Ryuga, unable to bring out his strongest monsters due to being unable to use his Spell Cards. Crowler suggests that the disk broke down, but Syrus says that he experienced the same problem against Ryuga, but he realized that no damage had been done to the disk. Secretly Ryuga used a ring that emitted a special signal that disabled Jaden's disk's ability to use  Spell Cards , while his own disk was shielded. Jaden is undaunted, though, and refuses to give up, using a  Alternate Fusion " to  Fusion Summon  " Elemental Hero Terra Firma " and uses " Shield Strike " to deal the final blow.
 
 Featured Duel: Jaden Yuki vs. Mr. Ryuga 
 Duel is shown from the fifth  turn .  Jaden   controls  " Elemental Hero Wildheart " (1500/1600) and " Elemental Hero Sparkman " (1600/1400), both in  Attack Position , and one  Set  card.  Mr. Ryuga  controls an unknown  monster .
 Turn 5: Jaden 
"Wildheart"  attacks  and  destroys  Ryuga's monster (Ryuga 3250).
 Turn 6: Ryuga 
Ryuga  Normal Summons  " Don Turtle " (1100/1200) in Attack Position and  activates  " Ultra Evolution Pill ",  Tributing  it to  Special Summon  " Cyber Dinosaur " (2500/1900) in Attack Position from his  hand . "Cyber Dinosaur" attacks and destroys "Wildheart" (Jaden 4000 → 3000). Ryuga Sets a card.
 Turn 7: Jaden 
Jaden's hand contains " Polymerization ", " Elemental Hero Woodsman ", " Elemental Hero Ocean " and two other cards. He attempts to activate "Polymerization", but cannot due to  Ryuga's ring  disabling his  Duel Disk 's  Spell Card  system. Jaden switches "Sparkman" to  Defense Position  and Normal Summons "Ocean" also in Defense Position.
 Turn 8: Ryuga 
Ryuga Normal Summons " Hyper Hammerhead " (1500/1200) in Attack Position. He then activates his  face-down  " Smashing Ground ", destroying "Sparkman". "Hyper Hammerhead" attacks "Ocean", but Jaden activates his face-down " Hero Barrier ",  negating  the attack as he  controls  a  face-up  " Hero " monster. Ryuga Tributes "Hyper Hammerhead" to activate the effect "Cyber Dinosaur", allowing it to attack  directly  as Jaden controls only Defense Position monsters (Jaden 3000 → 500).
 Turn 9: Jaden 
Jaden  draws  " Alternate Fusion ". He Normal Summons "Woodsman" (1000/2000) in Attack Position and Sets three cards.
 Turn 10: Ryuga 
Ryuga attacks "Woodsman" with "Cyber Dinosaur", but Jaden activates his face-down " Swamp of the Fallen ", halving the  ATK  of "Cyber Dinosaur" (2500 → 1250). He then activates his face-down "Alternate Fusion",  sending  "Ocean" and "Woodsman" to the  Graveyard  to  Fusion Summon  " Elemental Hero Terra Firma " (2500/2000) in Attack Position. The attack is redirected to it and "Cyber Dinosaur" is destroyed (Ryuga 3250 → 2000). [Notes 1]  Jaden activates his face-down " Shield Strike ", inflicting the  DEF  of "Terra Firma" as  damage  to Ryuga (Ryuga 2000 → 0).
