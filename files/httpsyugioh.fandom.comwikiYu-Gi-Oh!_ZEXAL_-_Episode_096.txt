 Summary 
       Vector explains that " Sargasso " was a  Field Spell Card .     
 From the  Different Dimension Airship ,  Yuma 's friends watch the Duel between Yuma and  Vector .  Tori  says Yuma's name out of concern. At  Shark 's Duel,  Rio  says she does not understand what just happened.  Orbital 7  rushes to  Kite 's side, yelling, "Master Kite!" Yuma asks what that card was, while  Astral  says it must be a  Field Spell Card .  Vector  responds that Astral is correct--the Field Spell they are playing on is called " Sargasso the Different Dimension Battlefield " and that it has been active since the very beginning (in the dub, Vector says Yuma and the others triggered the Field Spell themselves). Vector laughs that Yuma went right ahead and  Xyz Summoned  just as he expected. Astral confirms his suspicions--luring him and the others to "Sargasso" was indeed a trap. 
 Dumon  explains that "Sargasso" will inflict 500  damage  to a player when they Xyz Summon, and  Mizar  reveals further that it will also inflict 500 damage during the  End Phase  to a player who  controls  an Xyz Monster. Tori and  Flip  observe this from inside the airship, realizing that all three  Duelists  will take another 500 damage during the End Phase of each of their  turns .  Caswell  remarks that they'll have taken 1000 damage each during this turn (this is cut from the dub). Kite comments that this is a Duel with the risk of being continuously damaged (in the dub, Kite says that the damage isn't a risk, but a guarantee). Shark agrees; it could be fun. Vector asks Yuma if the "gift" he gave him made him happy. Astral observes that the conditions put on Yuma, Shark and Kite are also put on the  Barians , and asks what they are planning. Yuma runs towards Vector and curses at him again, declaring that no matter what traps Vector used, he will still defeat him because of what he did to  Ray . Vector says he will look forward to it. He steps on Ray, claiming that Ray is "supporting" Yuma as well (in the dub, Vector says Yuma is a true friend to Ray and asks Ray to thank Yuma, while adding that he won't be able to; the scene where Vector steps on Ray is cut from the dub). Yuma angrily yells at Vector to stop it and runs towards Ray, but Astral blocks his way, telling him to calm down. After hearing Vector's laughter, Astral cautions Yuma that giving in to anger was what Vector wanted.  Yuma and Shark both end their turns with a  Set  card each.  Bronk  comments that Yuma and Shark will take damage from "Sargasso". Lightning strikes Yuma and Shark again, decreasing their  Life Points  to 3000 each.
 
       " Galaxy-Eyes Photon Dragon " is Summoned.     
 Orbital 7 gasps that "Foolma" and "the inferior Shark" took damage again (In the dub, Orbital calls Yuma a "dumbbell" and Shark a "delinquent"). Continuing his own turn, Kite  activates  the  effect  of " Starliege Lord Galaxion ",  Special Summoning  " Galaxy-Eyes Photon Dragon " from his  Deck  by  detaching  two  Overlay Units . The eyes of "Galaxion" glow blue and it slashes its Overlay Units, while Kite removes the "Galaxy-Eyes" card from his Deck and Special Summons it. He ends his turn with a Set card and takes damage from the effect of "Sargasso", decreasing his Life Points to 3000. Orbital yells "Master Kite!" again.
 
       " Number 104: Masquerade " is Summoned.     
 Vector comments that Yuma's and Ray's friendship means that they will take the same amount of damage together. He begins his turn and  Normal Summons  " Umbral Horror Ghoul ". He activates its effect; by reducing its  ATK  to 0, he can Special Summon " Umbral Horror " monsters with 0 ATK from his hand. He Special Summons two copies of " Umbral Horror Will o' the Wisp ". Vector activates their effects to change their  Levels  to that of "Umbral Horror Ghoul". Yuma mutters that Vector is ready to Xyz Summon. Vector overlays the three Level 4 monsters to Xyz Summon his " Over-Hundred Number ", " Number 104: Masquerade ". Yuma says Vector finally Summoned his "Over-Hundred Number", which means that Vector will take damage from "Sargasso". 
 The lightning is about to strike Vector, but he  sends  " Sargasso Lighthouse " from his hand to the Graveyard by its own effect. A Graveyard portal appears and the lightning bolt is redirected towards it. As long as "Lighthouse" is in the Graveyard, Vector will take no damage from the effect of "Sargasso". Yuma mutters, "No way", while Astral says Vector took defensive measures should he have to Xyz Summon. Tori exclaims that Yuma is the only one who will take the damage from "Sargasso".  Cathy  complains that this isn't fair (in the dub, she says this is a catastrophe). Back at the Duel, Vector tells Yuma to squirm and suffer within "Sargasso" (in the dub, Vector says that every time Yuma plays, "Sargasso" will make him pay). He then attacks "Utopia" with "Masquerade." Yuma attempts to use the effect of "Utopia" to  negate  the attack, but Vector calls Yuma a fool and reveals the effect of "Masquerade", allowing him to not only negate the effect, but also inflict 800 damage. "Masquerade" throws one of its rings at the barrier put up by "Utopia", shattering it and striking Yuma, reducing him to 2200 Life Points. 
 Astral yells Yuma's name, then cringes in pain. Vector says he isn't finished and adds that the effect of "Utopia" was negated, allowing him to continue the attack. "Masquerade" throws another ring at "Utopia", but Yuma saves "Utopia" with his " Half Unbreak " Trap, allowing him to survive the attack with 2100 Life Points remaining, as it halves the  battle damage . Vector remarks on Yuma's toughness (in the dub, Vector compares Yuma to a cockroach). Yuma thinks that if he still has "Utopia", he can still Summon " Number C39: Utopia Ray V " and make a comeback. Vector says that as long as "Utopia" is on the field, the enjoyment will only increase (in the dub, Vector says the longer Yuma survives, the more fun it will be for him to be defeated). He Sets a card and ends his turn. Yuma swears to Vector that he will beat Vector to a pulp, just like how Vector did to Ray. Astral yells Yuma's name, but Yuma ignores it, continuing that he will win the Duel to avenge Ray (in the dub, Yuma yells that he did not care what anyone says). Astral tells Yuma to calm down once again, but Yuma snaps at him to shut up, claiming that he did not know how how he felt. Yuma blames himself for Ray's current state, then screams his name (in the dub, Yuma yells that as a friend, Ray helped him).  
 
         " Number 102: Star Seraph Sentry " is Summoned.     
 In his and Shark's Duel, Dumon begins his turn and Normal Summons " Star Seraph Scout ". He activates its effect to Special Summon a " Star Seraph " monster from his hand. He Summons " Star Seraph Sage ". Shark notes that Dumon has two monsters (in the dub, Shark says, "Let's see what you got"). Then Dumon uses the effect of "Sage", sending his own copy of "Sargasso Lighthouse" from his hand to his Graveyard to Summon a "Star Seraph" monster from his hand. He Summons "  Star Seraph Sword ". Bronk isn't happy that Dumon will be protected from the damage as well and calls it cheap, but Dumon states that he doesn't care what he must do - he must save the Barian World. Shark is surprised, muttering "save?" (in the dub, Shark mutters, "good luck" sarcastically) and Rio remarks that he's given Shark quite the handicap. Shark agrees with a grin (Rio's remarks are cut from the dub). Dumon states that he will have to go all out then, and he overlays the three "Star Seraph" monsters to Summon his "Over-Hundred Number", " Number 102: Star Seraph Sentry " avoiding the damage from "Sargasso" with "Sargasso Lighthouse". Rio mutters, "That's..." (in the dub, she comments on the monster's massive size), while Shark looks at the monster Dumon Summoned with a smirk, commenting that it finally came.
 
         The two " Galaxy-Eyes " dragons.     
 In the third Duel, Mizar begins his turn. He Special Summons " Schwarzschild Limit Dragon " from his hand via its own effect, as all of his opponent's monsters have 2000 or more ATK. As the monster appears, Kite grimly notes that it's Level 8 (in the dub, Kite thinks, "Bring it on"). Next, Mizar Normal Summons " Parsec, the Interstellar Dragon " without  Tribute  as he controls a Level 8 monster. He overlays his two Level 8 Monsters to Xyz Summon " Number 107: Galaxy-Eyes Tachyon Dragon ". Unlike his fellow Barians, Mizar allows himself to take damage from "Sargasso". Kite is surprised, asking him if he doesn't have a copy of "Sargasso Lighthouse" (in the dub, Kite urges Mizar to play the card). Mizar replies that he has it, but that it is "a card for cowards to use" ("there is no honor in playing this card" in the dub), saying he wants to determine the true "Galaxy-Eyes" master by Dueling on equal terms with Kite. Kite grins at the statement and agrees with Mizar (in the dub, Kite insists that he is the true "Galaxy-Eyes" master). 
 Yuma begins his turn, eager to win the Duel and save Ray (Yuma's  Draw Phase  is cut from the dub). Yuma is about to activate " Rank-Up-Magic Limited Barian's Force ", but Astral stops him. Yuma asks Astral why he stopped him. Astral tells him that if Yuma Xyz Summons, he will take damage from "Sargasso". Yuma reminds him that they will still take 500 damage at the End Phase and declares that he will finish the Duel with one hit (in the dub, Yuma asserts that he won't back down without a fight). Astral tells him that this Duel feels strange. Yuma asks what he means and Astral elaborates that he felt that Vector is luring them into another trap, which is different than the last time Vector Dueled against them. Yuma says that if he gets scared, he can't honor Ray's friendship. Astral warns Yuma to be calm again, only for the latter to brush it off. Flip panics, asking if Yuma and Astral are fighting. Cathy comments that it's almost as if Yuma and Astral aren't in sync with one another anymore. 
 
         " Number C39: Utopia Ray V " is Summoned.     
 Yuma activates "Limited Barian's Force" to perform a  Chaos Xyz Evolution  and Special Summon "Number 39: Utopia Ray V". Back on the airship, Yuma's friends cheer at its Summoning. Vector muses that "Utopia Ray V" finally made an appearance before pointing out that Yuma will take 500 damage from "Sargasso". A thunderbolt blasts Yuma again, reducing him to 1600 Life Points. Astral yells Yuma's name. Yuma activates the effect of "Utopia Ray V", detaching a Chaos Overlay Unit to  destroy  a monster on the field and inflict damage to Vector equal to its ATK. As "Utopia Ray V" readies its swords, Yuma recalls more memories of the times he spent with Ray and swears to avenge him. He destroys "Masquerade", noting that Vector can only use its effect when it  battles  (Yuma does not mention this in the dub). Vector vanishes behind a cloud of smoke as the damage hits home, disappearing afterwards. Yuma's friends cheer for him back at the airship. Flip says if Yuma attacks  directly , he'll win. Tori tells the others to hold on for a minute, as she notices something on the screen.
 
         Ray reveals himself as  Vector  (this expression is cut from the dub, though the reveal is not).     
 Yuma asks what's going on. As the smoke clears, Vector is gone, but the unconscious Ray is still there. Yuma asks if Vector disappeared, while Astral speculates that Vector could be sent to another dimension. Yuma mutters that he might have won. But he looks at Ray, reminding himself that he won't come back (in the dub, Yuma gets ready to tell Ray that he won). Yuma falls to his knees, then screams, as Ray's arm twitches and the others appear apprehensive at the situation. Ray suddenly awakens, as he mutters a weak "Thank you" to Yuma (in the dub, Ray says Yuma's name). Overjoyed, Yuma asks if Ray is still alive and runs toward him. Suddenly, Ray laughs in an uncharacteristic manner, saying he was just kidding. Ray continues that it's so funny it hurts his stomach (in the dub, Ray yells Yuma's name in a mocking tone. When Yuma asks if Ray is okay, he says he's more than okay). Yuma asks what he means. Ray remarks that Yuma is an interesting person and on how much he cared for him (in the dub, Ray says there's nothing wrong with him). He says he will show something more interesting to Yuma, as he initiates  Barian Battlemorph  (a closeup of Ray's face before he commences Barian Battlemorph is cut from the dub). 
 Tori exclaims, "What?" As Ray undergoes Barian Battlemorph, he yells, "YUMA!" (wings appearing on Ray's back during the Barian Battlemorph sequence is cut from the dub) When the transformation is complete, Ray is revealed to be Vector, who appears in his true form at last. This shocks Yuma and his friends. Yuma asks if Vector is impersonating Ray, and if he is, where the real Ray is. Vector quizzically asks, "Real? Who might that be?" ("The real Ray? You mean you still don't get it?!" in the dub), and reiterates his name. Then he calls Yuma too slow and states that he is "Ray Shadows". Yuma exclaims that can't be, and protests that he saw both Vector and Ray together--once when  Yuma Dueled Vector the other day before he took Ray away  and again when Ray was lying unconscious next to Vector a few moments earlier. Vector says Yuma still doesn't understand, (in the dub, he says things are not as always as they appear) and clarifies that the "Vector" in his previous Duel with "Ray" and in both of Vector's Duels with Yuma was a clone the original Vector created. Vector clarifies that he himself was Ray all along.
 Vector complains about the trouble he went through while posing as Ray, a dense transfer student ("an innocent little twerp" in the dub). Yuma mutters, "No way...", while Astral learns that Ray was a Barian all along. Yuma's friends are shocked, while a disgusted Dumon calls Vector's plan a makeshift method (in the dub, Dumon did not say anything at this point); Mizar appears disgusted as well. Vector calls Yuma simple-minded and says he had been spouting nonsense while he was disguised as Ray, and that Yuma believed every word, while adding that it was fun playing friends with him. He continues to taunt Yuma by mockingly saluting him, thanking him for "rescuing" him and calling him "Detective Yuma", while using Ray's voice (Vector's salute is cut from the dub).
 
         Astral  asks Yuma if he knew  Ray  was a  Barian .     
 Yuma tells Vector to stop joking, refusing to believe that Vector is Ray because Ray is the kind of person who does not trick people (in the dub, Yuma says he can tell between a phony Ray and the real one). Vector laughs and tells Yuma about the  five cards in his Deck as "proof of their friendship" . Yuma recalls  the time when Ray gave him the "V" cards . Astral asks what Vector means and asks Yuma if he knew anything about Ray being a Barian (in the dub, Astral asks if Ray gave Yuma "Barian" cards). Yuma hesitates, but Vector interrupts him, telling Yuma that he never told Astral about the "V" cards for his sake and reiterates that the "V" cards were tied to "Ray's" and Yuma's friendship (in the dub, Vector says he told Yuma not to tell Astral about the cards because he asked him not to). 
 Yuma's friends appear disgusted by this, while Tori mutters Yuma's and Astral's names (in the dub, she mutters that she can't believe it). Using Ray's voice, Vector "thanks" Yuma for protecting his "friendship" and not telling the others before breaking out into deranged laughter. Yuma is infuriated and attempts to directly attack Vector with "Utopia Ray V", but is quickly countered by Vector who activates his  face-down  " Vain Betrayer ". A purple beam of light strikes "Utopia Ray V", negating its attack and effects, while preventing it from attacking. Vector continues that all of Yuma's "V" cards will be sent to the Graveyard; the "V" cards appear from Yuma's Deck and are drawn into a Graveyard portal. Five green beams of light appear, as Vector continues that for each card sent, he will gain 500 Life Points, bringing him to 3800. Yuma is shocked, while Astral says Vector regained Life Points by the amount of damage he and Yuma took. Vector isn't done, and adds that he can  mill  five cards from Yuma's Deck for each "V" card sent to the Graveyard. Bronk repeats Vector's statement in surprise, while Rio continues that this could mean that Yuma lost most of his Deck. Astral calls Yuma's name, as cards fly out of Yuma's Deck and into the Graveyard portal, while Cathy finishes that Yuma lost 25 cards from his Deck. Vector corrects her--including the "V" cards, Yuma lost 30 cards in total. Yuma and Astral mutter, "Deck Destruction", while the latter reminds the former that he only has three cards left in his Deck and that  he will lose the Duel if he can't draw a card during his Draw Phase .
 
         Yuma's Deck is destroyed by " Vain Betrayer ".     
 Vector tells Yuma that human emotions are despicable and he will dry them up little by little (in the dub, Vector says he will enjoy destroying Yuma bit by bit). Yuma curses at Vector again, while Astral asks if having Vector's illusion Duel Yuma was Vector's plan from the start (in the dub, Astral deduces that Vector creating his Ray Shadows persona was the key to it all). Vector confirms it, says they're talking about Yuma and reiterates his plan of giving Yuma the "V" cards to earn his trust, ensuring that they are in his Deck (in the dub, Vector calls Yuma loyal, but gullible); he continues that if he actually killed "Ray", Yuma would lose his cool (in the dub, Vector says he knew that when Yuma saw the unconscious Ray, Yuma would lose control). He continues with him expecting Yuma to Summon "Utopia Ray V" and attack with it, finishing that it felt great to have someone move at his very whim (in the dub, Vector exclaims that his plan worked perfectly). Vector breaks out in laughter again, saying his plan is the greatest plan. Tori mutters Yuma's name again.
 
         Yuma screams at the sky (this scene is cut from the dub).     
 Vector taunts Yuma and asks him what he'll do with three cards left in his Deck and urges him to come at him with his best, adding that Yuma or the others won't be crossing this path alive anyway and that everything that happened is because he lured Yuma here. Astral asks Yuma if he really did not involve him with Ray for his sake, but Yuma asks him if he really did involve everyone. Vector responds that Yuma thought that "it was for the best", then laughs again ("Things went the Ray way" in the dub. In the original, Vector occasionally used Ray's voice while he taunted Yuma throughout the episode, while in the dub, he simply used his normal voice). Astral says Yuma's name, and Yuma screams at the sky (Yuma's scream is cut in the dub).
 
 
 Featured Duels 
 Yuma Tsukumo vs. Vector 
 Duel continues from  the previous episode . 
 Turn 1: Yuma  
 Yuma   Sets  a card. On Yuma's End Phase, the second effect of " Sargasso the Different Dimension Battlefield " activates (Yuma: 3500 → 3000 LP).
 Turn 2: Vector  
 Vector  draws " Umbral Horror Ghoul " and subsequently Normal Summon it ( 4/1800/0) in Attack Position. Vector then activates the  effect  of "Umbral Horror Ghoul" to reduce its  ATK  to 0 ("Umbral Horror Ghoul": 1800 → 0 ATK) and  Special Summon  two copies of " Umbral Horror Will o' the Wisp " ( 1/0/0 each) in Attack Position (as they are " Umbral Horror "  monsters  with 0 ATK). [Notes 1]  As they were Special Summoned, Vector activates the effects of both copies of "Umbral Horror Will o' the Wisp" to target "Umbral Horror Ghoul" and change the  Levels  of both copies of "Umbral Horror Will o' the Wisp" to that of "Umbral Horror Ghoul" (both "Umbral Horror Will o' the Wisp":   1 → 4). 
 Vector then  overlays  "Umbral Horror Ghoul" and two copies of "Umbral Horror Will o' the Wisp" in order to  Xyz Summon  " Number 104: Masquerade " ( 4/2700/1200, ORU: 3) in  Attack Position . The first effect of "Sargasso" activates, but Vector activates the first effect of " Sargasso Lighthouse " to prevent the damage by sending "Sargasso Lighthouse" from his hand to the  Graveyard . As long as "Sargasso Lighthouse" remains in Vector's Graveyard, he is unaffected by the effects of "Sargasso". 
 "Masquerade"  attacks  " Number 39: Utopia ", but Yuma activates the effect of "Utopia" to  detach  an  Overlay Unit  ("Utopia": 2 → 1 ORU) and  negate  the attack. As the opponent activated a monster effect during the  Battle Phase , Vector activates the second effect of "Masquerade" to negate the effect of "Utopia" and inflict 800 damage to Yuma by detaching an Overlay Unit ("Masquerade": 3 → 2 ORU) (Yuma: 3000 → 2200 LP). Yuma activates his face-down " Half Unbreak " to prevent "Utopia" from being  destroyed by battle  and halve the battle damage he takes (Yuma: 2200 → 2100 LP). Vector Sets a card.
 Turn 3: Yuma  
Yuma  draws  (Yuma's Deck: 34 → 33). He then activates " Rank-Up-Magic Limited Barian's Force " to  Rank-Up  "Utopia" via  Chaos Xyz Evolution  in order to Xyz Summon " Chaos Number 39: Utopia Ray V " ( 5/2600/2000, ORU: 2) in Attack Position. The first effect of "Sargasso" activates (Yuma: 2100 → 1600 LP). Yuma activates the effect of "Utopia Ray V" to destroy Vector's "Masquerade" and inflict its ATK as damage to Vector by detaching a Chaos Overlay Unit ("Utopia Ray V": 2 → 1 ORU) (Vector: 4000 → 1300 LP). 
 At this point, it's revealed the Vector Yuma was dueling was actually a clone. Ray Shadows reveals himself to be the real Vector who continues in the clone's place. "Utopia Ray V" attacks  directly , but Vector activates his  face-down  " Vain Betrayer " to send all " V " cards from Yuma's  Deck  to the Graveyard (" V Salamander ", " V Gnome ", " V Undine ", " V Sylph " and " V Call ") (Yuma's Deck: 33 → 28) (as Yuma attacked with a "V" monster) and allow Vector to gain 500  Life Points  for each card sent to the Graveyard (Vector: 1300 → 3800 LP). In addition, Yuma must send cards from the top of his Deck to the Graveyard equal to the number of "V" cards sent times five (Yuma's Deck: 28 → 3). As long as "Vain Betrayer" remains  face-up , "V" monsters cannot attack and their effects are negated, so the attack of "Utopia Ray V" is stopped.
 Duel continues in  the next episode . 
 
 Reginald "Shark" Kastle vs. Dumon 
 Duel continues from  the previous episode . 
 Turn 1: Shark  
 Shark   Sets  a card. On Shark's End Phase, the first effect of "Sargasso" activates (Shark: 3500 → 3000 LP).
 Turn 2: Dumon  
 Dumon  draws " Star Seraph Scout " and subsequently Normal Summons it ( 4/1200/1800) in Attack Position. Dumon then  activates  the  effect  of "Star Seraph Scout" to  Special Summon  " Star Seraph Sage " ( 4/1600/1400) (a " Star Seraph "  monster ) in Attack Position. 
 Dumon then activates the effect of "Star Seraph Sage" to send " Sargasso Lighthouse " (a Spell Card) from his hand to the Graveyard and Special Summon " Star Seraph Sword " ( 4/1400/1000) (a "Star Seraph" monster) in Attack Position. As "Sargasso Lighthouse" is now in his Graveyard, Dumon is unaffected by the effects of " Sargasso the Different Dimension Battlefield ". Dumon  overlays  "Star Seraph Scout", "Star Seraph Sage", and "Star Seraph Sword" in order to Xyz Summon " Number 102: Star Seraph Sentry " ( 4/2500/2000, ORU: 3) in  Attack Position .
 Duel continues in  the next episode . 
 
 Kite Tenjo vs. Mizar 
 Duel continues from  the previous episode . 
 Turn 1: Kite  
 Kite   activates  the  effect  of " Starliege Lord Galaxion " to  detach  both of its  Overlay Units  ("Starliege Lord Galaxion": 2 → 0 ORU) and  Special Summon  " Galaxy-Eyes Photon Dragon " ( 8/3000/2500) from his  Deck  in  Attack Position . Kite  Sets  a card. On Kite's End Phase, the second effect of " Sargasso the Different Dimension Battlefield " activates (Kite: 3500 → 3000 LP).
 Turn 2: Mizar  
Mizar draws " Schwarzschild Limit Dragon " and subsequently Special Summons it ( 8/2000/0) in Attack Position via its own effect (As Kite  controls  a  monster  with 2000 or more  ATK ). As he controls a  Level  8 monster, Mizar  Normal Summons  " Parsec, the Interstellar Dragon " ( 8/800/800) in Attack Position without  Tribute  via its own effect. Mizar  overlays  "Schwarzschild Limit Dragon" and "Parsec" in order to  Xyz Summon  " Number 107: Galaxy-Eyes Tachyon Dragon " ( 8/3000/2500, ORU: 2) in Attack Position. The first effect of "Sargasso" activates (Mizar: 4000 → 3500 LP).
