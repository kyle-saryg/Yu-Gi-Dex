 Design 
 Voice/Mannerisms 
 In the Japanese version, when  Yusei   destroys  Andre's " Speed Spell - End of the Storm ", Andre mockingly replies "gracias", the Spanish word for "thank you". [2]  This suggests that Andre is either Spanish or from a Spanish-speaking country. In the dub he makes a bullfighting pun.
 
 Biography 
 History 
 Before joining  Jean  and  Team Unicorn , he is seen Dueling against another  Duelist , who defeats him. After his defeat, Jean approaches him, taking note that Andre could have won the Duel. When Andre doesn't respond, Jean tells him that he is like himself: neither of them wants to watch the loser upset, so they lose the Duel on purpose. Jean then requests that Andre join his team, with Andre accepting. Jean suggests that if they Duel as a team, they will be motivated to win so that they do not disappoint their teammates. They will not be Dueling for only themselves, but for the team as a whole. [3] 
 The two later recruit  Breo  to be the third member of their team. The team sweeps several tournaments, with Andre being such a force that neither of this teammates have to Duel at all. They finally won the  Atlantis Tournament  before joining the  World Racing Grand Prix . [4] 
 
 Pre-World Racing Grand Prix 
 During the  WRGP  premier event, Andre approaches  Yusei Fudo , as he recognizes him to be the winner of the  Fortune Cup . [4] 
 Before the WRGP preliminaries commence, an incident occurs during Andre´s team early riding practice.  Breo  intentionally crashes into  Crow , and fortunately, no one is hurt. After  Jack Atlas  and Yusei arrive to the scene, Andre introduces himself along with his teammates, Breo]and  Jean . At that moment Yusei recognizes him from the event and also that they are  Team Unicorn . After some discussion between the two teams, Andre convinces Yusei to Duel against him, and Yusei agrees to this. [1] 
 Even from the start of the Duel, Andre threatens Yusei by  swarming  his own  field  with powerful  Beast - Type   monsters . However, Yusei manages to make a comeback and almost wins the Duel, but the Duel is stopped due to a time limit rule. Yusei notes afterwards that Andre still had a trap that could have turned the Duel around when the time limit was reached. [5] 
 
 World Racing Grand Prix 
 On the day the  WRGP  commences, Andre's team faces off against  Team 5D's . The first member of  Team Unicorn  to play is Andre against  Jack Atlas . Following the team's plan, Andre shifts his strategy to one based on countering  attacks , knowing that  Team 5D's  had decided to lead with Jack as a counter to Andre's own previous Power-oriented strategy. This is highly effective and he defeats Jack relatively quickly. [6] 
 The next opponent he faces is  Akiza Izinski . Though she burns through a good amount of his  Life Points , he deals even more  damage , and Akiza sacrifices the last amount of her Life Points to  Summon   Yusei 's " Stardust Dragon ". [7] 
 While Dueling Yusei himself, he uses " Magic Charge " to deplete the remainder of his own  Life Points , but also deal 2000  damage  to Yusei. [2] 
 After  Team 5D's  wins the Duel, Andre, Jean and Breo Duel  Team Catastrophe , with Andre as their starter once again. Unfortunately, both Andre and Jean crash, and Team Catastrophe wins by default because Jean could not get back to the starting line. [8] 
 
 Ark Cradle 
 During  Yusei 's Duel with  Jakob , he remembers Andre along with his teammates as one of the powerful teams which he has faced and won't forget.
 During Yusei's Duel with  Z-One , Andre along with his team mates are among the crowds of people cheering Yusei on to defeat him and save  New Domino City .
 
 Manga biography

       Andre in the manga.     
 Andre was first seen during the opening ceremonies of the  D1 Grand Prix . [9]  He has yet to be seen Dueling but it is presumed that he is participating due to an embarrassing loss against  Jack Atlas  as  Rex Goodwin  mentioned that the participants all have some form of vendetta against the king.
