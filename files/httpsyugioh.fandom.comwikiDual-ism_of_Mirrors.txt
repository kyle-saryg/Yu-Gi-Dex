 Lyrics (TV Size) 
 Kanji Rōmaji English 
 親友 に 最初 からなれるわけじゃない 
それもリアル 
 真剣 なバトルの 中 でみつける 
もうひとつの 自分 
 
 葛藤 からの 覚醒 は 
チャンスのターン！つかむ！ドロー 
デュエル！デュアル・イズム 
 
とぎ 済 ましあうカード 
 運命 の 相手 は 心 、 映 す 鏡 
もしも＜ 引き分け ＞のままで 
 
 
 倒 れたら 泥 だらけで 讃 え 合 おう 
 shinyū ni saisho kara nareru wake janai 
Sore mo riaru 
Shinken na batoru no naka de mitsukeru 
mou hitotsu no jibun 
 
kattō kara no kakusei ha 
chansu no tān! tsukamu! dorō 
dyueru! dyuaru-izumu 
 
togi sumashi au kādo 
unmei no aite ha kokoro, ustsusu kagami 
moshimo <hikiwake> (tai) no mama de 
 
 
taoretara doro-darake de tatae aou 
 It's not like we could have become best friends from the start 
That's the reality 
In the midst of a serious battle I find 
Another me 
 
This struggle-born awakening is 
A chance turn! Grasp it! Draw 
Duel! Dual-ism 
 
Our cards sharpened by each other 
A fated opponent is a heart-reflecting mirror 
Even if while it's a tie 
 
 
We should fall and become muddy, let's honour each other

 Trivia 
 Like in  BRAVING! ,  Trey ,  Quinton  and  Quattro 's faces are shaded, indicating their return to the show as allies. 
 The pose of  Don Thousand  at the end resembles that taken by  Dr. Faker  in the endings  My Quest ,  Longing Freesia  and  Wild Child . 
 Despite the prominent featuring of " Number 32: Shark Drake " and " Number C32: Shark Drake Veiss ", neither appeared in the anime during the entire run of this opening.
