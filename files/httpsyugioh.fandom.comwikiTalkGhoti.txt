 can't ask the forums cause new topic button broke, but concerning Askaan- flying fish don't have horns and the cowfish and the combtoothed blenny are the only bicorned fish I can think of. Blennies would fit the body shape but I am unsure of the exact species, such as the butterfly blenny, the sphinx blenny, or longhorn blenny. I've spent all day and Zaniolepis is my best guess. I won't quit. Akarroa  ( talk  •  contribs ) 05:22, 18 November 2022 (UTC)
 Blenny faces don't seem to fit Askaan. Plus, blenny horns are over their eyes, while Askaan's come out of its back. A flying fish's head and fins are more similar to Askaan's, despite the lack of horns. I admit there probably is another fish that Askaan is more likely to be based on than a flying fish, but I don't think that fish is a blenny.

 Scorpaena grandicornis maybe?  Akarroa  ( talk  •  contribs ) 06:04, 18 November 2022 (UTC)
