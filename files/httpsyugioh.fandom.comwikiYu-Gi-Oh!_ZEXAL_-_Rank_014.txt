 Summary 
   This summary is currently incomplete. 
 Yuma  and  Astral  continue their  Speed Duel  against  Thunder Spark , but are cornered by Spark's combo with his " Number ", " Thunder Spark Dragon ". When victory seemed impossible, Astral comes up with a winning formula - however, for that, Yuma needs to fulfill one condition.
 
 Featured Duel: Yuma Tsukumo vs. Thunder Spark 
 Duel continues from  the previous Rank . 
 Turn 3: Thunder Spark 
 Thunder Spark   activates  the  effect  of " No. 91: Thunder Spark Dragon ",  detaching  3  Overlay Units  to  destroy  all  monsters   Yuma   controls . He then attacks Yuma  directly  (Yuma 4000 → 1600). Spark activates the  Continuous Spell  " Spirit Converter ", allowing him to re- attach  1 Overlay Unit to a monster he controls by  Tributing  2 monsters during his  End Phases . 
 Turn 4: Yuma 
Yuma  Normal Summons  " Knight Hunger Monger " (1000/1600) and activates " Swords of Revealing Light ", preventing Thunder Spark from attacking for three turns.
 Turn 5: Thunder Spark 
Spark Normal Summons " Thunder Mountain " and " Rolling Thunder ", and activates the effect of "Spirit Converter", Tributing them to re-attach one Overlay Unit from his  Graveyard  to his "Thunder Spark Dragon" (ORU 2 → 3). Spark  Sets  a card.
 Turn 6: Yuma 
Yuma Normal Summons " Gagaga Magician " (1500/1000) and then Overlays it and "Knight Hunger Monger" to  Xyz Summon  " No. 39: Utopia " (2500/2000) in  Attack Position . He attacks "Thunder Spark Dragon" with "Utopia", but Spark activates his  face-down  " Dragon Booster ", increasing the  ATK  of "Thunder Spark Dragon" by 500 (2400 → 2900). Yuma  chains  his face-down " Negate Attack ",  negating  his own attack.
 Turn 7: Thunder Spark 
Thunder Spark activates the effect of his "Thunder Sea Horse" from his  hand ,  discarding  it to add 2 more "Thunder Sea Horse" cards from his  Deck  to his hand.

Thunder Spark Normal Summons " Electrode Beast Cation " (300/???), using its effect to Special Summon " Electrode Beast Anion " (300/???) from his Deck, and using the latter's effect to  draw a card .
