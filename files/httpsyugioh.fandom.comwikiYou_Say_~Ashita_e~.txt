 Romaji 
 
 Oh nogarerarenu unmei dato shita nara 
genjitsu ni me wo soresazu ashita e to mukau yo 
shinjita omoi ga senaka oshitekureru 
tomo ga ite kizuna wo shiru ashita mata tsuyokunareru 
mirai nara sugu soko ni mieteru yo 
itsudatte hora sono ipposaki de 
nando mo hohoenderu kimi mo mieru hazu sa 
You say, always, you never give up. I believe 
sou kizutsu ite mo nigiri shimeta omoi 
butsukeai tagai wo shitte tsunagatte yuku no sa 
tomo ni miageta yozora ni hoshi ga hashiru 
tachi tomari mayou toki wa ano hoshi wo omoidasu yo 
massugu na nete miru kono sekai wa 
omou hodo warui mono janain da to 
tooku wo mitsume nagara yoake wo matteiru 
kokoro kara ima shinjirareru kara 
taisetsu na mono mamori tsuzukeru yo 
kotoba wa nakutemo sou katari aueru hazu sa 
You say, always.
 
 
 English translation 
 Episode 90 
 
 
 Oh, if fate were to be inescapable, 
I'll head towards tomorrow, never turning a blind eye to reality. 
My beliefs are giving me a push on the back. 
Because I have friends, I know about bonds. 
Tomorrow, I'll become even stronger. 
One can see the future right there. 
And always, you know, one stap ahead. 
I bet one could see you smiling, time and time again. 
YOU SAY ALWAYS.
