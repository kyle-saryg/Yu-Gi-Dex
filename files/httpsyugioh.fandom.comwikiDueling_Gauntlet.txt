       A Dueling Gauntlet     
 A  Dueling Gauntlet  was a glove worn by  Duelists  that took part in the  Duelist Kingdom  tournament. It was used to hold the  Star Chips  that the Duelist earned by winning  Duels . The Star Chips are placed on the wrist of the gauntlet, which holds a total of ten.  Joey Wheeler  took  Weevil Underwood 's Gauntlet after the latter was defeated by  Yami Yugi , as Joey himself did not have a glove to begin with, being a stowaway participant; the same case happened with  Keith Howard  taking either  Sid  or  Zygor 's.
 
 
 Eliminator Gauntlet 
       PaniK 's Dueling Gauntlet.     
       An Eliminator's Gauntlet compared to a normal one.     
 Duelists hired by  Pegasus  to be  Eliminators  were given special gauntlets that could hold more Star Chips than normal. For example,  PaniK  had two double sized gauntlets, allowing him hold up to forty  Star Chips  (the number of extra chips considering only four finalists were allowed), instead of the usual ten. However,  Ghost Kaiba  and the  Paradox Brothers  wore regular gauntlets of ten chips, suggesting that PaniK wore larger gloves to express his brutality and love of hunting down any and every duelist possible. In the manga, PaniK's gauntlet also housed a wire that he used to wrap around his opponent's neck, to prevent them from escaping, and to strangle them if they anger him or, as  Dark Yugi  wagered his life, kill them for losing.
