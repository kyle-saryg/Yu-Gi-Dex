 Daedalus Bridge  is a bridge connecting  Satellite  to  New Domino City .
 Construction of the bridge had been halted by  Sector Security  for a while. The incomplete bridge still existed as a monument associated with a legend to residents of Satellite.
 With the defeat of the  Dark Signers , the bridge was finished as there was no longer any need to separate the two cities.
 Daedalus Bridge itself is one of the ruined structures which composes the  Divine Temple .

 History 
 Early construction 
         The original Daedalus Bridge.     
 The people of Satellite lived in poverty and worked for the richer New Domino City. The Satellite residents were not allowed to cross into the city. 
Rex Goodwin came to a coastal part of Satellite, where the bridge currently stands, on a Duel Runner. Nobody living there knew who he was. Every day Rex used to stare across the waters dividing Satellite and New Domino. One day he stopped staring, as he realized what he must do and began building a bridge to the city.
 People thought he was crazy at first, but after seeing his progress and determination, they began to help him as they hoped for a better future in the city.
 Some people frowned at the idea and forced construction to halt. Goodwin became wanted by  Sector Security . The helpers gave up, figuring it would be hopeless once the man was captured. Eventually Goodwin was cornered by Security. Rather than be caught and spend the rest of his life in jail, he rode his Duel Runner along the bridge and flew off to the other side of the sea.
 Those involved never knew what happened to the man after he took off the bridge. They didn't even know if he survived or not, but he became a legend and the Duel Runner became a symbol for freedom amongst the residents of Satellite.
 
 Completion 
         Daedalus Bridge from the city side     
 Before the final battle between the  Signers  and the  Dark Signers  takes place, Yusei requests  Rex Goodwin  to promise to finish the bridge once the Dark Signers are defeated, as there would no longer be any need to separate the two cities.
 Rex Goodwin dies as one of the Dark Signers, but the bridge is finished regardless sometime after his death. The completed version consisted of a much more modern bridge, connecting the two cities. The old incomplete version was left inside, where the bridge splits in two, as a monument.
 
           Turbo Duels courses     
 A highway which connects all of New Domino itself was also built. Even with very short notice, Turbo Duelists can request to use parts of the bridge for Turbo Duels. After gaining permission,  Sector Security  closes off some of the roads and sets up a  Turbo Duel  circuit.
 When the  Divine Temple  appeared over the city,  Team Ragnarok  planned to build a route towards the Temple using the original Daedalus Bridge as a starting point so  Team 5D's  could reach it. While waiting for the route to appear Yusei reflected about how Goodwin jumped off the bridge and how he was about to do the same.
 
 
 Influence 
 The bridge is named after  Daedalus  from Greek mythology, who was able to fly using artifical wings, similar to how  Rex Goodwin  flew using his Duel Runner.
 The story became a legend often told to younger children in Satellite. The man who began the construction of the bridge is regarded as a hero and his Duel Runner symbolizes freedom.
 Crow  has told the story many times to children living in the area near the bridge and has even added wings to his Duel Runner,  Blackbird , inspired by the story.
 Yusei Fudo 's friends have compared him to the man from the story.  Blister  has even considered that Yusei's  Mark of the Dragon  carries the wishes of the man. Now that  Crow  has Yusei's Tail mark it could be considered that what  Blister  said was true.
 Due to the completion of the bridge, all barriers that once existed between  Satellite  and  New Domino City  have disappeared.
