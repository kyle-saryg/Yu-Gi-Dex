 Featured Duel: Yuya Sakaki vs. Jack Atlas 
       Yuya vs. Jack, Round 3.     
 At the start of the  Duel , the  Field Spell Card  " Crossover Acceleration " is  activated , as per the rules of an  Action Duel . It will allow the players to use  Action Cards , but they may only have one in their  hand  at a time.
 Turn 1: Jack 
As Jack controls no monsters, he Special Summons " Red Gargoyle " (1200/1400) from his hand via its own effect. He Normal Summons " Red Resonator " (600/200). Jack activates the effect of "Gargoyle", allowing him to double the Level of a monster he controls. He doubles the Level of "Resonator". Jack tunes the Level 4 "Gargoyle" with the Level 4  Tuner monster  "Red Resonator" to Synchro Summon " Scarlight Red Dragon Archfiend " (3000/2000) in Attack Position. He Sets a card.
 Turn 2: Yuya 
Yuya activates " Stargazer Magician " (   1) and " Timegazer Magician " (   8) in his Pendulum Zones. He Pendulum Summons " Odd-Eyes Pendulum Dragon " (2500/2000), " Performapal Coin Dragon ", (1700/1000) and " Performapal Odd-Eyes Minitaurus " (1200/1600) from his hand in Attack Position. The effect of "Coin Dragon" increases the ATK of all Dragon-Type monsters that Yuya controls by 500 and prevents them from being destroyed by card effects ("Odd-Eyes": 2500 → 3000 ATK, "Coin Dragon": 1700 → 2200 ATK). "Odd-Eyes" attacks "Scarlight". As an "Odd-Eyes" monster is battling, the effect of "Minitaurus" activates during  damage calculation , decreasing the ATK of "Scarlight" by 100 for each " Performapal " and " Odd-Eyes " monster Yuya controls ("Scarlight": 3000 → 2700 ATK). Jack activates his face-down " Red Gem ", preventing " Red " monsters from being destroyed this turn. The effect of "Odd-Eyes" doubles the battle damage as it is battling a Level 5 or higher monster (Jack: 4000 → 3400 LP).
 Turn 3: Jack 
Jack activates the effect of "Scarlight" to destroy all  Special Summoned  monsters with ATK less than its own and inflict 500 damage to Yuya for each. The effect of "Coin Dragon" prevents Yuya's Dragon-Type monsters from being destroyed by card effects, so only "Minitaurus" is destroyed (Yuya: 4000 → 3500 LP).

"Odd-Eyes" attacks "Scarlight". As an "Odd-Eyes" monster is battling, Yuya activates the effect of "Minitaurus", decreasing the ATK of "Scarlight" by 100 for each " Performapal " and " Odd-Eyes " monster Yuya controls ("Scarlight": 3000 → 2700 ATK). Jack finds and activates the Action Card "Evasion", which would negate the attack. As a Pendulum Monster is battling and a Spell Card was activated, Yuya activates  Pendulum Effect  of " Stargazer Magician " to negate that Spell Card's activation, Set it, and prevent it from being activated for the rest of this turn. As a Spell Card was Set to his field, Jack Special Summons " Red Giant " (600/???) by its own effect. The other effect of "Red Giant" ends the  Battle Phase .
 Turn 5: Jack 
Jack activates " Red Reborn ", allowing him to Special Summon a " Red " monster from his  Graveyard . Jack Special Summons "Gargoyle" (1200/1300). Jack Normal Summons " Double Resonator " (0/0). As it was Special Summoned, Jack activates its effect, allowing him to treat a monster he controls as a Tuner monster this turn. Jack targets " Red Giant ". Jack  Double Tunes  the  Level  4 "Red Gargoyle" into his Level 1 Tuner monsters "Double Resonator" and Level 5 "Red Giant" to Synchro Summon " Tyrant Red Dragon Archfiend " in Attack Position (3500/3000). "Tyrant" attacks and destroys "Coin Dragon" (Yuya: 2700 → 1400 LP). "Scarlight" attacks "Minitaurus", but Yuya activates the effect of " Performapal Odd-Eyes Dissolver ", as a monster he controls his battling. He can prevent his attacked monster from being destroyed by that battle, take no battle damage, Special Summon "Dissolver" from his hand, and negate the effects of a monster Jack controls. "Minitaurus" is not destroyed, Yuya Special Summons "Dissolver" in Attack Position (2000/2600), and "Tyrant" has its effects negated. The other effect of "Dissolver" prevents it from being destroyed by battle or card effects this turn. Jack activates the effect of "Scarlight" to destroy "Minitaurus" and "Odd-Eyes" (Yuya: 1400 → 400 LP). Jack Sets a card.
 Turn 6: Yuya 
Yuya Pendulum Summons "Coin Dragon" (1700 → 2200/1000), "Odd-Eyes" (2500 → 3000/2000), and "Minitaurus" (1200/1600), all in Attack Position. Yuya  overlays  his  Level  4 "Coin Dragon" and "Minitaurus" to  Xyz Summon  " Dark Rebellion Xyz Dragon " (2500/2000, ORU: 2). Yuya Normal Summons " Performapal Odd-Eyes Synchron ". He activates its effect, which lets him Synchro Summon a monster using itself and a card in his  Pendulum Zone .

 Differences in Adaptation 
 In the original version Yusho does not know to who Jack Atlas is, while in the dub he knows who he is. 
 The plot point of Yuya sensing that the dragons fear Ray is removed in the English dub. 
 Mistakes 
 In the the English dub, Jack refers to  Red Gargoyle  as "Red Giant" after reviving it with  Red Reborn .
