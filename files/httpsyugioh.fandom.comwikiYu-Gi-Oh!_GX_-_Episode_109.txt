 Summary 
   This summary is currently incomplete. 
 Jaden  continues his  Duel  with  Axel Brodie  in order to save  Syrus . Axel is Dueling on the orders of  Thelonious Viper , who wishes him to force Jaden to play seriously and show his true power - even if it means that Axel must lose the Duel. After Jaden Summons " Neo-Spacian Flare Scarab " Axel thinks there's no way he'd be dumb enough to attack head-on with two weak monsters and believes that because he left them in a  Attack Position , his  Set  card must be a  Trap Card .
 Jaden proceeds to attack anyway, surprising Axel. However, he's still prepared, and activates his  face-down  " Firewall "  Trap Card , which allows him to  remove  monsters from his  Graveyard  to  negate   direct attacks . Using this, Axel effectively locks down Jaden's ability to deal damage.
 Jesse  and  Hassleberry  realize that at this point, Axel is only focused on the Duel. The begin to slowly move away, so they can attempt to save Syrus while Axel is distracted. After Jaden successfully counters Axel's strategy using " Contact Out ", Axel thinks back to his time with his  father  and recalls his father telling him that soldiers have the right to defend themselves in battle. Therefore, on his next turn, he goes for an all-out assault, dealing 2000 damage to Jaden and destroying all of his monsters. This angers Viper, who is watching the Duel through a screen in his  lab , who thinks Axel is now abandoning his mission. Axel also releases Syrus, but the latter's complaining causes the rope to snap anyway. Luckily Jesse catches him before he falls, and Jaden and Axel can Duel in peace.
 Axel could have won the Duel had he activated " Volcanic Force " to Summon " Volcanic Doomfire " but opts for a different strategy, activating " Wild Fire " instead. He still believes this alternate strategy would result in a win for him, but Jaden activates " Elemental Mirage ", which wins him the Duel. Had Axel opted for his original strategy, "Elemental Mirage" wouldn't have been effective. When the Duel ends, the  Bio-Bands  they are wearing drain energy from both of them. Both Duelists collapse, and Jaden ends up in the infirmary.  Ms. Fontaine  believes that something else must be wrong, as Dueling alone couldn't cause such a condition.
 At this point, Syrus believes he is not yet fit to be in  Obelisk Blue  and thus chooses to return to  Ra Yellow . In the Japanese version, he specifically says he wishes to take his  brother 's old title of "Kaiser" for himself, but must become stronger before he can. In the English version, he returns to Yellow so he can protect Jaden.
 
 Featured Duel: Jaden Yuki vs. Axel Brodie 
 Duel continues from  the previous episode .
 Jaden has 4000 Life Points remaining and controls "Elemental Hero Avian" (1000/1000) in Attack Position. He also has one set card.
 Axel has 3500 Life Points remaining and has "Blaze Accelerator" active along with a set card.
 Turn 3: Jaden 
Jaden draws " Neo-Spacian Flare Scarab " and subsequently Normal Summons it (500/500) in Attack Position. Due to the effect of "Flare Scarab", it gains 400 ATK for each Spell and Trap Card Axel controls. Axel has two ("Flare Scarab": 500 → 1300/500). " Elemental Hero Avian " attacks directly, but Axel  activates  his face-down " Firewall ". Now if Axel gets attacked directly, he can remove from play one Pyro-type monster in his Graveyard to negate the attack. During each of Axel's Standby Phases, he must pay 500 Life Points or else "Firewall" is destroyed. Axel then activates the effect of "Firewall" by  removing from play  " Volcanic Shell " from his  Graveyard . "Flare Scarab" attacks directly, but Axel activates the effect of "Firewall" by removing from play the second "Volcanic Shell" from his Graveyard.
 Turn 4: Axel 
Axel draws "Soul of Fire". On Axel's Standby Phase, he pays 500  Life Points  to keep "Firewall" in play (Axel 3500 → 3000). Axel then activates " Soul of Fire " to remove from play " Infernal Flame Emperor " from his  Deck  and inflict damage to Jaden equal to half of "Infernal Flame Emperor's" ATK (Jaden 4000 → 2650) at the cost of forbidding himself from attacking this turn and letting Jaden  draw a card [Notes 1] .  Axel's hand contains "Volcanic Force", " Fire Trap ", " Burial from a Different Dimension ". Axel then  Sets  two cards ("Fire Trap" and "Burial from a Different Dimension"). 
 Turn 5: Jaden 
Jaden draws "Contact Out". He then activates " Fake Hero " to  Special Summon  " Elemental Hero Neos " (2500/2000) from his  hand  in  Attack Position . During the End Phase, "Neos" will be returned to Jaden's hand if it has not been removed from the field this turn. Jaden then  Contact Fuses  "Neos" with "Flare Scarab" in order to Special Summon " Elemental Hero Flare Neos " (2500/2000) in Attack Position. Due to the effect of "Flare Neos", it gains 400 ATK for each Spell and Trap Card on the field. There are currently five ("Flare Neos": 2500 → 4500/2000). 
 "Flare Neos" then attacks directly, but Axel activates his face-down "Burial from a Different Dimension" to add his two "Volcanic Shells" and "Infernal Flame Emperor" from his  Removed from Play Zone  to his  Graveyard . Axel then activates the effect of "Firewall" by removing from play "Volcanic Shell" from his Graveyard. "Avian" then attacks directly, but Axel activates the effect of "Firewall" by removing from play the second "Volcanic Shell" from his Graveyard. Jaden then activates " Contact Out " to return "Flare Neos" to the  Fusion Deck  and Special Summon "Neos" (2500/2000) and "Flare Scarab" (500 → 1700/500) from his Deck in Attack Position. "Neos" attacks directly, but Axel activates the effect of "Firewall" by removing from play "Infernal Flame Emperor" from his Graveyard. "Flare Scarab" attacks directly (Axel 3000 → 1300).
 Turn 6: Axel 
Axel draws "Blasting Vein". On Axel's Standby Phase, he pays 500 Life Points to keep "Firewall" in play (Axel 1300 → 800). Axel then activates " Blasting Vein " to destroy his face-down "Fire Trap" and draw two cards ("Volcanic Scattershot" and "Tri-Blaze Accelerator"). Since "Fire Trap" was destroyed and sent to the Graveyard while it was face-down, its second effect activates, allowing Axel to draw another card ("Wild Fire"). Axel then  Sends  " Blaze Accelerator " to the Graveyard in order to activate " Tri-Blaze Accelerator ". Now Axel, during each of his Main Phases, can send a Pyro-type monster from his hand to the Graveyard to destroy one monster Jaden controls and inflict 500 damage to Jaden. If Axel activates the effect of "Tri-Blaze Accelerator", he won't be allowed to attack in the turn he activates its effect. 
 Axel then activates the effect of "Tri-Blaze Accelerator" to send " Volcanic Scattershot " from his hand to the Graveyard and destroy "Elemental Hero Avian" (Jaden 2650 → 2150). Since "Volcanic Scattershot" was sent to the Graveyard, its first effect activates, inflicting 500 damage to Jaden (Jaden 2150 → 1650). Since "Volcanic Scattershot" was sent to the Graveyard through the effect of a "Blaze Accelerator" card, its second effect activates, allowing Axel to send two "Volcanic Scattershots" from his Deck to the Graveyard and destroy all of Jaden's monsters. The first effect of the two sent "Volcanic Scattershots" then activate (Jaden 1650 → 1150 → 650). Axel then Sets two cards.
 Turn 7: Jaden 
Jaden draws " Elemental Hero Wildheart " and subsequently Normal Summons it (1500/1600) in Attack Position. Jaden explains that since "Wildheart" can't be affected by Trap Cards, Axel can't activate the effect of "Firewall" in response to "Wildheart" attacking. "Wildheart" attacks directly. Axel is about to activate his face-down " Volcanic Force " to Special Summon " Volcanic Doomfire " and use it to win the Duel, but he chooses not to do so. Axel then activates his face-down " Wild Fire " to pay 500 Life Points (Axel 800 → 300) and destroy "Tri-Blaze Accelerator" as well as destroy all monsters on the field and Special Summon a " Wild Fire Token " (1000/1000) in Attack Position. Jaden activates his face-down " Elemental Mirage " to return "Wildheart" (1500/1600) to the field in Attack Position. "Wildheart" then attacks and destroys the "Wild Fire Token" (Axel 300 → 0).
 
 Mistakes 
 In the dub, when  Axel  uses " Burial from a Different Dimension " to return " Infernal Flame Emperor " and two " Volcanic Shells " to his  Graveyard , the cards shown returning there are  three  "Volcanic Shells". 
 Trivia 
 In the dub, Syrus breaks the fourth wall by referring to Jaden as the star, and him the sidekick.
