 Appearance 
       Full-body image of Nail.     
 Nail is a frail young bespectacled boy with dull blonde hair, pink eyes, and white-rimmed ovular spectacles. He wears simple clothes; a white shirt and simple pants and shoes.
 
 Personality 
 Nail is a polite and analytical boy who firmly believes in the concept of 'setsuri' or providence. He questions established norms like "Why are mountains tall?" and even created an entire street run by  Goha Corporation drones  to establish that point with things like selling shirts with one sleeve long and the other sleeve short.
 
 Etymology 
 Nail’s surname, “Saionji” means “West garden temple”.

 Deck 
 Nail uses a  Cyberse  Deck  focusing on maintaining an advantage on effects differ on different versions of his "tron" monsters; " Femtron ", " Attron ", " Yoctron ", and " Zeptron " which replenishes his hand, and sends cards back to his Deck, or send them to the graveyard depending on what goes on including the " Hole " Trap Cards to counter whatever monsters his opponent summons to protect his combo of his "tron" monsters. His main strategy is to  Maximum Summon  " Yggdrago the Heavenly Emperor Dragon Tree " by using it with its " Left " and " Right " counterparts for several effects, and great attack power.
 His Cards seem to be based on the World Tree, Yggdrasil, a tree that is a vital part of the Norse Mythology that houses the realms between Asgard, and Helheim with "Yggdrago" as the tree itself while the "tron" monsters seem to be its leaves.
