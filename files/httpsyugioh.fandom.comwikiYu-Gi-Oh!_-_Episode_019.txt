 Summary 
 In the cave,  Yugi  and the group have no way of removing the boulder blocking the entrance. Suddenly,  Bakura 's  Millennium Ring  starts to point, presumably towards  Pegasus 's  Millennium Eye . 
 Following where the ring points, they end up at a large  Dueling Arena , where the  Paradox Brothers  appear. They say that Yugi and a partner from his group have to face them in a tag-team  Duel . If they win, they will have to choose one of the two doors the brothers guard. One door leads them out of the  Paradox Brothers' dungeon , while the other leads to a even larger maze that is impossible to get out of. Yugi and  Joey  agree to the conditions, betting six  Star Chips  between them, enough to gain them entrance to  Pegasus Castle  if they win. The rules are as follows: all four players start with 2000  Life Points  each, and will move in turn, alternating between teams. However, if just one Duelist loses their life points, his partner will also lose, regardless of their amount of life points.
 Dox   summons  " Labyrinth Wall ", which changes the Duel Arena into a maze. 
 During the Duel, Para and Dox say that from now on, one brother will speak only the truth and the other will speak only lies; they also offer Joey and Yugi the option to each ask one question. Joey is excited about this prospect, having heard a similar riddle before, and asks his question right away. Yugi, however, immediately recognizes the  liar paradox  here, and waits to ask his question until later.
 Meanwhile,  Mokuba , trapped in Pegasus's underground prison, is thinking about  Seto Kaiba  and what happened to them when they were younger. Kaiba, on the other hand, is outside, approaching Pegasus's castle.
 
 Featured Duel: Yami Yugi & Joey Wheeler vs. Para & Dox 
 
 This Duel uses  Duelist Kingdom  gameplay. Rules and  card effects  may differ from that of the  TCG / OCG . See the individual card articles for more information.     
       9×9 maze created by "Labyrinth Wall".     
 Turn 1: Dox 
 Dox   Normal Summons  " Labyrinth Wall " (0/3000). During this Duel and exclusively in the anime, "Labyrinth Wall" acts like a  Field Magic Card  in addition to a  monster . Once activated, "Labyrinth Wall" creates a 9×9 maze on the Dueling Arena that each player's monster must go through before they can reach the other side. Monsters can move a number of spaces equivalent to their  Level . Monsters can attack each other inside the maze, but must be on tiles adjacent to one another.
 Turn 2: Yami Yugi 
 Yugi   draws . He then Normal Summons " Beaver Warrior " (1200/1500) in  Attack Position . Since it's a Level 4 monster, Yugi moves it 4 spaces inside the maze.
 Turn 3: Para 
 Para  draws. He then  activates  " Polymerization " to  fuse  " Shadow Ghoul " into "Labyrinth Wall" and  Special Summon  " Wall Shadow " (1600/3000) in Attack Position. "Wall Shadow" can travel through the walls of the maze instead of actual spaces, allowing it to strike any monster that is inside the labyrinth instantaneously. "Wall Shadow"  attacks  and  destroys  "Beaver Warrior" (Yugi: 2000 → 1600  LP ).
 Turn 4: Joey 
 Joey  draws. He then Normal Summons " Axe Raider " (1700/1150) in Attack Position and  Sets  a card.
 Turn 5: Dox 
Dox draws. He then Sets " Jirai Gumo " on a space in the maze and Normal Summons " Labyrinth Tank " (2400/2400) in Attack Position. Since it's a Level 7 monster, Dox moves it 7 spaces inside the maze.
 Turn 6: Yami Yugi 
Yugi draws. He then Normal Summons " Celtic Guardian " (1400/1200) in Attack Position. Since it's a Level 4 monster, he moves it 4 spaces inside the maze.
 Turn 7: Para 
Para draws. "Wall Shadow" attacks "Celtic Guardian", but Joey activates his face-down " Kunai with Chain ", equipping it to "Axe Raider" and increasing the ATK of "Celtic Guardian" and "Axe Raider" by 500 ("Celtic Guardian: 1400 → 1900/1200, "Axe Raider": 1700 → 2200/1150). "Celtic Guardian" destroys "Wall Shadow" (Para: 2000 → 1700 LP). On Para's  End Phase , the boost that "Celtic Guardian" got from "Kunai with Chain" expires ("Celtic Guardian": 1900 → 1400/1200).
 Duel continues in the next episode . 
 
 Differences in adaptations 
 The scenes on  Pegasus ' view screen have been changed in the US version to show a hidden arena, and then a close-up of  Yami Yugi . Yami Yugi and Joey can be seen dueling the brothers in the arena, which is a mistake because they are still in the tunnels. In the Japanese, he's watching  Yugi  and the others walking through the tunnels, with small views of other scenes along the side of the screen. 
 Original Japanese Jonouchi questions if the brothers are from Hong Kong; this question is removed from the dub. 
 In the US version,  Para 's fierce face is replaced with a milder image from earlier. 
 A long shot of the  duel  is added to the US version, to provide a transition from the commercial break. 
 Another scene of the  Paradox Brothers ' acrobatics is added to the US version. The Japanese version goes right to  Para 's ordering the  attack . 
 A shot of fierce  Para  telling  Yami Yugi  his " Elf Swordsman " is doomed, and his Life Points with it, is replaced in the US version with  Dox  saying the same thing. 
 Dox  sets " Jirai Gumo " as a trap card, which, in the Japanese version, it was, but in the US version, it has a monster card design as it does in real life (though the ATK and DEF are different for this duel). 
 In the US version, Para says that the turns will cycle starting with him, then Yugi, then his brother, then Joey, and then back to him. He and Dox are actually in the other's spot in the cycle. (This is possibly due to the direction switch of reading the brothers' "name"). 
 
 
 Mistakes 
 In the US version, for one scene, " Labyrinth Tank " is in its original Japanese card format.
