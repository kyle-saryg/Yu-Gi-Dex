 Synopsis 
 Yami Marik unleashes Ra in its most powerful form, Egyptian God Phoenix which burns Joey and his monster. Miraculously, Joey barely survives the attack. Joey has defeated Ra, but before he makes his winning attack…
 
 
 Featured Duels 
 Yami Marik vs. Joey Wheeler - Part 4 
 Duel continues from previous episode. 
 Joey has 1200  Life Points  remaining and controls "Gilford the Lightning" (2800/1400) in Attack Position.
 Yami Marik has 1900 Life Points remaining and controls "The Winged Dragon of Ra" (?/?) in its "Egyptian God Phoenix" mode.
 Turn 17: Yami Marik 
Yami Marik has just transformed " The Winged Dragon of Ra " into " Egyptian God Phoenix ". Yami Marik then  activates  one  effect  of "Egyptian God Phoenix" to pay 1000 Life Points ( Marik  1900 → 900) and attack and destroy " Gilford the Lightning ". Due to this being a  Shadow Game , Joey takes a lot of damage, but is still standing. At the End Phase, "Egyptian God Phoenix"  returns  to Marik's  Graveyard  under "The Winged Dragon of Ra" form, due to its effect.
 Turn 18: Joey Wheeler 
Joey draws " Gearfried the Iron Knight " and subsequently Normal Summons it (1800/1600) in Attack Position. He then attempts to declare an attack, but due to his condition, he collapses before successfully declaring it.
 As Joey can't continue the Duel, Yami Marik wins by default.
 Epilogue 
Despite losing a  Shadow Game ,  Joey 's mind battles the shadows and resists being banished to the  Shadow Realm . He nonetheless remains unconscious and is taken away for medical attention. (This is possibly due to Marik not meeting any winning conditions, with Joey just collapsing in order for Marik to win and both of them still having Life Points beforehand).
 Marik, on the other hand, also suffers from the Shadow Game. When Marik realizes that he almost lost to Joey, he gags into his hand, before leaving to recover.
 
 Joey vs. Unknown opponent 
 Duel already in progress. Joey's  opponent  has 70 Life Points and controls " Holograh " in Attack Position (1100/700). Joey controls no cards.
 Turn ?: Joey Wheeler 
Joey Normal Summons " Flame Swordsman " (1800/1600) in Attack Position. "Flame Swordsman" attacks and destroys "Holograh" (Joey's opponent 70 → 0).
 
 Changes to English Dub 
 Cut from the dub is a scene from " The Winged Dragon of Ra 's"  attack  which shows close ups of a laughing Marik and a screaming Joey. 
 Cut from the dub is  Marik  about to vomit as the duel platform finishes lowering. 
 Cut from the dub is  Marik  coughing frequently after almost vomiting. 
 Cut from the dub is a bit where Mokuba puts his hand in front of Joey's nose to feel for his breath, then says that Joey isn't breathing, with the gang all staring in horror. 
 Cut from the dub is a scene of Tristan trying to punch Joey awake, only for Duke to stop him from doing so as well as a shot of Mokuba calling for a doctor. 
 Added to the Dub are noises from an unconscious Joey to make it seem like he never died like in the sub. 
 Shots of Joey wired up to machinery on a bed are also removed from the dub.
