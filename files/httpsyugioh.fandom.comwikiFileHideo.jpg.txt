 Biography 
 History 
       Akiza  attacking Hideo with her  powers .     
 When Akiza was a child, she always wanted to spend time with her father, but he was always busy with work. When she finally managed to get some free time with him to have a Duel, he received a call from work, which pushed her to awaken her  Signer  powers, hurting her father in the process. After that event, it is because of those same terrible powers, that he and his wife couldn't accept Akiza anymore and eventually ended up rejecting her.
 
 Dark Signers 
 After Akiza's Duel against the  Dark Signer ,  Misty Tredwell  from which she results to be left unconscious, Hideo and his wife,  Setsuko , go to visit her, where  Jack Atlas  tells him the only person who can save her is  Yusei Fudo . He goes to visit him, telling him about what happened between them and begging for his help. After Yusei agrees to help they both go back to the city, as then he was able to wake her up with the help of the  Mark of the Dragon . However when she sees them, because of their past and the current events that have occurred she gets angry. 
 Thus she Duels against Yusei and he accepts, knowing that it is the only way for him to reach out to her. As the Duel progresses, Hideo notices that not only Yusei is protecting them from Akiza's psychic powers, but also " Stardust Dragon ". When he sees Yusei receiving real damage from Akiza's constant attacks, Hideo cannot stand it anymore and uses himself as a shield to protect Yusei. He tries to reason with her, but Akiza doesn't want to listen to him. Everything changes once Yusei is able to reach out to Akiza by countering her with his strategy.
 As Akiza's powers are starting to destroy the room, she unknowingly gains control over them when she protects Hideo from harm. After Akiza helps him, Yusei ends the Duel. After that, Hideo and his daughter are able to resolve their issues.   
 After Akiza makes up her mind of fighting the Dark Signers, his wife expresses concern over her daughter undertaking such a dangerous task. As they have finally become a family again, thus Hideo convinces Setsuko that she should have more faith in their daughter. As he understands that Akiza has been searching for that something to believe and that it lies ahead, as also she wants to find some purpose for her psychic powers to be used. However Hideo tells her daughter that there is the risk that if she cannot control her powers these could end up destroying Akiza.
 However Hideo is confident that as long as Yusei is by her side Akiza will be alright.

However as he sees his wife concern by this, still Hideo tells Akiza that they will witness her  Turbo Duel . After Akiza loses to  Andre  and cries thinking that she wasn't able to help the team, Hideo cheers her up by saying that she did great. Because of his seen determination, everyone else on the crowd starts applauding to her.
