 Summary 
   This summary is currently incomplete. 
 Jim  and  Hassleberry  are both in the infirmary after their  Survival Duel .  Jesse  states that it seems obvious that the moment a  Duel  ends, the  Bio-Bands  drain the  Duelists  energy and transfer them somewhere - but where and for what purpose remains unknown. He also confirms, besides cutting his hand off, there's no way of removing the Bio-Band.
 Nurse Fontaine  shares her concerns about Survival Duels with  Dr. Crowler  and  Vice-Chancellor Bonaparte . Both seem very concerned as well, and they confront  Thelonious Viper  about it. Viper brushes it off, and states that in a week's time, everyone will be the better for it. Bonaparte is next shown in the woods near the  Ra Yellow  dorm, where he sees  Blair  attempt to persuade  Marcel  to eat lunch, stating that he looks pale and exhausted.
 Viper finds  Adrian Gecko  on  Duel Academy 's roof, and informs him that if he does not participate in a Survival Duel by the end of the week, he will be expelled.  Axel  infiltrates Viper's office when the latter is not there, and discovers papers dealing with Viper's hideout at  the lab  where  Wheeler  had previously been trained. Viper himself is surprised how much Duel energy he's been able to gather so quickly, but knows that the Academy's staff is suspicious. However, he states he will turn the absorption level up to maximum when Adrian Gecko Duels, so that he can eliminate him, as Adrian has discovered Viper's secret already.
 Adrian receives the analysis of the Bio-Bands he had requested from his  contact  on the nearby submarine. He discovers that if the absorption rate is turned up to maximum, death is possible. Adrian assumes correctly that Viper will turn up the absorption rate to maximum during his Duel, and begins working on a plan to circumvent that.
 Adrian invites all of the  Ra Yellow  and  Obelisk Blue  students to a party at the Obelisk Blue dorm. This makes Jaden jealous when he discovers Jesse, Alexis and Syrus all have invitations and he doesn't have one. They all agree to stay with him in the Slifer Dorm instead of going to the party.
 Hearing this,  Chazz  begins to research the Gecko family, and discovers that they have even more money than the Princeton family. Jealous of this, Chazz arranges to Duel Adrian.
 
       Blair and  Marcel  at  Adrian's  party.     At the party, Adrian announces a Survival Duel tournament, with the winner receiving a treasure of the Gecko family - a  Duel Disk  made of gold and jewels (called the "Jewel Disk" in the dub). However, this is merely a cover, and he hopes that if many students are Dueling simultaneously, Viper will be forced turn the absorption rate down. Adrian begins the tournament and leaves to find an opponent for himself.
 When Adrian exits the Obelisk Blue dorm, he's confronted by Chazz Princeton and lifted onto a platform suspended by a helicopter, as is Chazz. Adrian accepts Chazz's challenge, thinking the champion of the  Genex Tournament  should be a worthy opponent. Chazz gains an early advantage, but is worried because Adrian seems so calm despite being down to 1200  Life Points .
 
 Featured Duel: Chazz Princeton vs. Adrian Gecko 
 Turn 1: Adrian 
Adrain draws " Lucky Cloud " and subsequently activates it. Now if Adrian summons at least two " Cloudian " monsters with the same name during this turn, he can draw two cards during his  End Phase . Adrian then activates " Summon Cloud ". Now once per turn during each of Adrian's Main Phases, if Adrian controls no monsters, he can Special Summon one Level 4 or below Cloudian monster from his hand or either player's Graveyard. 
 Adrian activates the effect of "Summon Cloud" to Special Summon " Cloudian - Sheep Cloud " (0/0) in Defense Position. Adrian then  Normal Summons  another "Cloudian - Sheep Cloud" (0/0) in Defense Position. On Adrian's End Phase, the effect of "Lucky Cloud" activates, letting Adrian draw two cards.
 Turn 2: Chazz 
Chazz draws "Different Dimension Hangar". Chazz's hand contains " V-Tiger Jet ", " X-Head Cannon ", " Premature Burial ", " Hyper Coat ", and " Polymerization ". Chazz then activates " Different Dimension Hangar ", which  remove from play  " W-Wing Catapult ", " Y-Dragon Head " and " Z-Metal Tank " from his Deck. Now if Chazz summons a monster(s) whose name is written in the card text of the monster(s) removed by this effect, that monster(s) can be  Special Summoned  to the  field , but they can't attack or be Tributed.
 Chazz then Normal Summons "V-Tiger Jet" (1600/1800) in Attack Position. The second effect of "Different Dimension Hangar" activates, allowing Chazz to Special Summon "W-Wing Catapult" from the  Removed from Play Zone  (1300/1500) in Attack Position. Chazz then  Removes from play  "V-Tiger Jet" and "W-Wing Catapult" in order to Special Summon " VW-Tiger Catapult " (2000/2100) in  Attack Position . Chazz then activates the effect of "VW-Tiger Catapult" to discard "X-Head Cannon" and switch one "Cloudian - Sheep Cloud" to Attack Position.
 Chazz then activates "Premature Burial" to pay 800 Life Points (Chazz 4000 → 3200) and revive "X-Head Cannon" (1800/1500) in Attack Position. The second effect of "Different Dimension Hangar" then activates, allowing Chazz to Special Summon "Y-Dragon Head" (1500/1600) and "Z-Metal Tank" (1500/1300) from the  Removed from Play Zone  in Attack Position. Chazz then removes from play "X-Head Cannon", "Y-Dragon Head", and "Z-Metal Tank" in order to Special Summon " XYZ-Dragon Cannon " (2800/2600) in Attack Position.
 "VW-Tiger Catapult" then attacks and destroys the Defense Position "Sheep Cloud". "XYZ-Dragon Cannon" then attacks and destroys the  Attack Position  "Cloudian - Sheep Cloud" (Adrian 4000 → 1200). Since the two "Cloudian - Sheep Cloud" were destroyed and sent to the Graveyard, their effects activate, allowing Adrian to Special Summon four " Sheep Cloud Tokens " (0/0 each) in Defense Position (two Sheep Tokens for each "Sheep Cloud" that was just destroyed and sent to the Graveyard).
 Chazz then removes from play "VW-Tiger Catapult" and "XYZ-Dragon Cannon" in order to Special Summon " VWXYZ-Dragon Catapult Cannon " (3000/2800) in Attack Position. Chazz then activates the first effect of "VWXYZ-Dragon Catapult Cannon" to remove from play Adrian's "Summon Cloud". Chazz then  Sets  a card.
 Duel continues in  the next episode .
 
 Differences in adaptations 
 The dubbed version of this episode has achieved some degree of infamy. Much of the dialogue was changed to resemble something that would not be out of place in  Yu-Gi-Oh!: The Abridged Series , leading some fans to joke that the episode was written by  LittleKuriboh . In particular,  Syrus  breaks the  fourth wall , stating that he's "just the wimpy sidekick" and could "never have an idea that would move the plot along." In addition,  Chazz  states that he's "really good at playing card games" and that "that's what life is really all about anyway. 
 Alexis mentioned that her bio band went off as she fought a survival duel. This is removed in the dub. 
 Mistakes 
 In the dub, when Adrian explains the effect of " Lucky Cloud ," he mistakenly says that  drawing , rather than  Summoning  2 or more "Cloudian" monsters with the same name is necessary to use this card's effect. 
 In the dub, when Chazz destroys both of Adrian's " Cloudian - Sheep Clouds ", Adrian asks Chazz if he is wondering why his 2 cloud  tokens  became four; this is a faux pas because it's implied that the two "Sheep Clouds" monsters that were on his field  before  the four " Sheep Cloud Tokens " got Summoned were  also  tokens. In addition, he says that he Summoned them by Tributing the "Sheep Clouds", when they were Summoned as they were  destroyed by battle 
 In the dub, even though Chazz's " VWXYZ " monsters  were edited while in his Hand, they are not while on the Field. 
 In both versions, after Chazz Summons " VWXYZ-Dragon Catapult Cannon ", the " XYZ-Dragon Cannon " card is still shown on his  Duel Disk . 
 In the dub, " Z-Metal Tank " is shown as a  Normal Monster  in Chazz's  hand .
