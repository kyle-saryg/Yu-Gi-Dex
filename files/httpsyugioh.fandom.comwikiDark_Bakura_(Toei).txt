 Biography 
 Through his host Ryo Bakura, Dark Bakura played RPGs including  Monster World  with many people, though Yami Bakura turned the innocent sounding games into  Shadow Games . As a  Penalty Game , the loser often had their soul trapped in a miniature to be used as a Monster World non-playable character, leaving the victims' bodies in comas. Bakura often had to change schools as a result of this.
 After transferring to  Domino High School , Ryo Bakura is picked on by  Mr. Karita , the gym teacher of the school. Dark Bakura plays a Shadow Game with Karita, turning him into a miniature. That night, Dark Bakura talks to Bakura for the first time, telling Bakura that he is his new host and that he has his sights set on acquiring  Yugi Mutou's   Millennium Puzzle .

 Bakura sets up a miniature "Monster World" game, to play with Yugi,  Katsuya Jonouchi ,  Hiroto Honda ,  Anzu Mazaki  and  Miho Nosaka . Bakura tries to warn his friends, and get them to leave, but Dark Bakura takes over and invites them in, while pretending to be Bakura.
 
       Yami Yugi in his shadow game with Bakura     
 Each of the group picks a type of monster they wish to play as, and Bakura seals them inside miniatures of their selected monsters.
 Ryo Bakura managed to emerge during the RPG, taking control of the body's left hand. Ryo Bakura intentionally fumbled several critical dice rolls, giving Yugi an edge in the game. Once Dark Bakura realized this, he impaled his good self's controlled hand on a tower spire of the game board's castle, laughing madly. Ryo Bakura then sealed his soul into a pair of possessed dice. He caused the dice to shatter, effectively ending the game, though killing himself in the process.
 The good Bakura is dead when Dark Yugi reaches him. His avatar in the RPG is still animated, however, and  White Mage Bakura  uses his power as a level 13 mage to bring him back to life. When doing this, Dark Bakura is also placed back together with him.
