 Maximillion Pegasus , known as  Pegasus J. Crawford  in the Japanese version, is the president of  Industrial Illusions  and the creator of the game of  Duel Monsters . He owns many cards that have never been released to the public. He originally wanted to be an artist before becoming obsessed with Egypt and creating  Duel Monsters . This did serve to fulfill his original dream as he drew monsters for his game.

In the American version of the anime, he wants to take over KaibaCorp and gain possession of the  Millennium Items  to combine KaibaCorp technology with the items in the hope of reviving his lover,  Cecelia . He becomes an ally of the protagonists starting after  Battle City .

 Design 
 Personality 
 Pegasus is depicted as a well-mannered yet overly dramatic man obsessed with cartoons, concealing the appearance of a ruthless businessman and gamer, and yet a man of his word.
 
         Linework     
 Pegasus has a habit of calling  Yugi  "Yugi-boy" and  Kaiba  "Kaiba-boy". This trend continues in  Yu-Gi-Oh! GX . When sufficiently provoked, he can have a temper. Pegasus is also notable for his foppish manner, dandified appearance, and effeminate hairstyle, all of which have led to him being referred to as "cutie-pie" (by  Bandit Keith ) and an "overdressed prima donna" (by  Joey Wheeler ).
 Pegasus is interested in cartoons, especially  Funny Bunny , which he watched every Saturday morning while growing up in America. Cartoons are the inspiration for many of his cards, such as the  toon monsters .
 Pegasus at first comes across as a cheater with a thirst for collecting souls and achieving his ambitions. This impression is changed when his true motive is revealed. Not only is Pegasus an excellent businessman, his motivations for acting as the above was the resurrection of his deceased lover  Cecelia . Because he needed KaibaCorp's Solid Vision and thus needed KaibaCorp, the deal with the Big Five is that he be given control if he beat Yugi, to restore Kaiba Corp's reputation as Yugi beat Kaiba. From this, his cheating to beat Yugi and kidnapping Solomon, Mokuba, and Seto Kaiba becomes somewhat understandable. Furthermore, Pegasus himself honors his pledge to Yugi Muto claiming to be both "duty-bound" and a "man of [his] word", releasing the souls of  Solomon Muto , Seto and,  Mokuba Kaiba  before being defeated in a  Shadow Game  by  Yami Bakura . Despite cheating with the Millennium Eye himself, Pegasus showed a dislike for people who cheat for personal gain, such as Bandit Keith (who cheated right in front of him). In the anime, he was somewhat light-hearted in this aspect, simply making fun of Keith while dropping him with a trapdoor. However, he allowed the Duel to continue, presumably to see how Joey had grown as a Duelist. 
 Pegasus also displays great humility after his defeat; although he only had to free Solomon, Mokuba, and Kaiba if he lost to Yugi, he still gave him the prize money, having read Joey’s mind and realizing that Joey needed the money to save his sister’s eyesight.
 In the manga, Pegasus often puts on a timid facade to trick his enemies. He pretends to be discouraged by minor upsets in his duels with Yugi and Kaiba, then acts as if his strategies are purely luck-based. When Kaiba attempts to use the duel disk prototypes, Pegasus pretends that he's too weak to carry the device, forcing Kaiba to use Pegasus' arena.
 Years later in  Yu-Gi-Oh! GX , Pegasus dropped his ruthless facade completely and became more laid back and jovial. This was shown during his Duel against  Vellian Crowler  and  Jean-Louis Bonaparte .
 In the English dub of Bonds Beyond Time, Pegasus is portrayed with an extremely vain personality. Some of this in the English version of the anime while not as extreme is present.
 
 Voice and mannerisms 
 Being an American, Pegasus has a tendency to use English words when speaking in the Japanese version. He also has a somewhat poor grasp of the Japanese language, repeatedly using the word "desu" (です, meaning "is") in places where it has no meaning.
 
 Etymology 
 In all Japanese versions, Pegasus is known as  Pegasus J. Crawford . In the dub and manga, the name is instead  Maximillion Pegasus .
 In the English  Yu-Gi-Oh! The Duelists of the Roses  video game, and in the instruction booklet for  Yu-Gi-Oh! Forbidden Memories , his original name,  Pegasus Crawford  is used, while in the other games his dub and manga name is used. Pegasus is unusual in that his English name is used in the English manga while most  Yu-Gi-Oh!  human characters keep their Japanese names in the English manga. In the video game,  Yu-Gi-Oh! The Falsebound Kingdom , the character representing Pegasus within the virtual world of the game is named  Pegasus J. Kroitzel .
 In  Yu-Gi-Oh! Reshef of Destruction , Pegasus takes an alias. In the Japanese version, he takes the name  Taiyō Tenma  (天馬 太陽,  Tenma Taiyō ). In the dub, he takes the name  Sol Chevalsky , an approximate name when compared to his Japanese alias (Sol and Taiyou translate into "Sun").
 
 Biography 
 History 
         Pegasus as a little Boy     
 Maximillion Pegasus first met  Cecelia  at a party thrown by his businessman father in Las Vegas 14 years before  Duelist Kingdom . The two fell in love and made plans to live together. Pegasus often spent time painting portraits of her. (In the dub, the two got married.) Cecelia died of illness at the age of 17.
 
         Pegasus meets Cecelia.     
 Pegasus searched the world looking for anything that could possibly revive the dead. His quest led him to Egypt, where their beliefs of an afterlife intrigued him.
 
         Pegasus gets the Millennium Eye.     
 Here he met  Shadi , the ghost of a guardian of the  Millennium Items . Shadi warned him that he wouldn't find the solutions to his problems here and tells him to leave. Pegasus is impressed as he thinks Shadi just read his mind. He ignores Shadi's warning and follows him to an underground temple. After Shadi realizes Pegasus followed him, he puts him to the  Millennium Eye 's test. If Pegasus was worthy of the Eye, he would be granted his dearest wish, which was to see Cecelia again. Pegasus has his left eye replaced with the Millennium Eye, which Shadi forced into Pegasus' socket.
 After receiving the eye, Pegasus saw a vision of Cecelia for a brief moment, enough to hug her before returning to reality.
 Pegasus soon learned of the ancient  Shadow Games  that were played in ancient Egypt and became obsessed with their powers. Having created  Industrial Illusions , he started a new game in the United States,  Duel Monsters , a card game based on the Duels of ancient times. Combining the magic of the Millennium Items with these cards had the same effect as using them with the stone slabs originally used.
 On a second trip to Egypt, Shadi took Pegasus to an underground city and led him to the chamber, containing a tablet of carvings of the  Egyptian Gods . Pegasus then returned to America to create the God Cards, basing them off what he'd seen on the tablet.
 
         Pegasus witnesses the Egyptian Gods vision     
 However, everyone Pegasus employed to work on the God cards died or disappeared in the dub. Despite this, Pegasus refused to stop this project. He continued to paint the God Cards himself. As he did so, he fell asleep and dreamed of an Egyptian city being destroyed by the Gods. Shadi appeared to Pegasus in the dream and warned him of the danger he was unleashing. He told Pegasus that his only hope was to return the God Cards to their resting place.
 Fearing for his life, Pegasus returned to Egypt, and had  Ishizu Ishtar , a current guardian, bury the Egyptian God Cards in the Pharaoh's tomb.
 In the dub, during some unprecedented time in the creation of  Duel Monsters , Pegasus had also traveled to Eastern Asia, where he drew inspiration from the religions and mythologies to create the  Spirit monster  card variety. [3] 
 Pegasus receives a proposal from  Seto Kaiba  from  KaibaCorp  inquiring about developing a  Dueling Arenas  to amplify  Duel Monsters .
 
         Pegasus vs. Bandit Keith     
 Pegasus participated in the Intercontinental  Duel Monsters  Championship tournament and faced  Bandit Keith  in the finals. Pegasus toys with Keith and reads his mind using the  Millennium Eye . He scribbles down some notes and calls a kid, named  Sam , from the audience over. He hands Sam the instructions and tells him to use them to defeat Keith. In the meantime, Pegasus sits with Kaiba and happily accepts his proposal to develop the holographic system, as they watch Sam defeat and humiliate Keith.
 Pegasus is also present at the regional Duel Monsters Championship in Japan. He hands the prizes to the winner  Weevil Underwood  and invites him to participate in his  Duelist Kingdom  tournament.
 Pegasus is the inspiration for  Dungeon Dice Monsters , a game that  Duke Devlin  created. After playing Duke in a game, Pegasus approves the creation of Dungeon Dice Monsters, wanting to expand it further. Upon Pegasus' request, Duke allows him to make an addition to the game. Pegasus adds " Dark Magician " as a monster, which Duke doesn't learn of until later. Pegasus also hacks into KaibaCorp's computer system and adds some of Dungeon Dice Monsters' data.
 
 Yu-Gi-Oh! 
 Duelist Kingdom 
         Pegasus learns of Kaiba's defeat     
 Pegasus is informed of the uncontested  Duel Monsters  champion,  Seto Kaiba , being defeated by  Yugi Muto . He struck a deal with  The Big Five  from  KaibaCorp  in an attempt to overthrow Seto Kaiba and gain control of KaibaCorp. Pegasus planned the  Duelist Kingdom  tournament in the hopes of defeating Yugi Muto to restore the company's reputation (and take Yugi's  Millennium Puzzle  in the dub). He planned to use KaibaCorp's  Solid Vision  technology to create a holographic version of Cecelia. (In the dub, he planned on using the Millennium Items and the technology to revive Cecelia.)
 
         Pegasus Dueling Yugi through the  video     
 Pegasus sent Yugi a  videotape  and items needed to participate in the tournament. Through the videotape, Pegasus was able to communicate with Yugi on the spot and faced him in a timed Duel. Pegasus won and stole the soul of Yugi's grandfather as Yugi's  Penalty Game . He forced Yugi to enter Duelist Kingdom to get back the soul of his grandfather.
 Pegasus sent his henchmen to take care of Kaiba, but he escaped, making it look like he jumped to his death. Pegasus' henchmen kidnapped  Mokuba , who had swallowed a key to a safe of documents Pegasus required to take over KaibaCorp.
 Kaiba managed to get to the  Duelist Kingdom island  and demanded that Pegasus give Mokuba back. Pegasus responded by sealing Mokuba's soul in the " Soul Prison " card. He told Kaiba he would need 10  Star Chips  to see him, like the other contestants. He gave him the 5 Star Chips Mokuba had previously stolen and told Kaiba that he must beat Yugi to get the other 5.
 
         Pegasus seals Kaiba's soul in a " Soul Prison " card     
 Kaiba did so and prepared to Duel Pegasus using his  Duel Disks , which he has designed to counter Pegasus' mind reading strategy. Pegasus agreed to use them, provided Kaiba also accepts his terms; to have Mokuba's body hold his Duel Disks. Kaiba refused to attack his own brother, so he Dueled Pegasus using a standard  Dueling Arena . With the ability to read his opponent's mind, Pegasus defeats Kaiba and traps his soul in another "Soul Prison" card.
 Pegasus watched the semi-final Duels; Yugi Muto against  Mai Valentine  and  Joey Wheeler  against  Bandit Keith . Having been humiliated by Pegasus in their last encounter, Keith held a gun to Pegasus after losing his Duel and demanded the prize money. Pegasus opened a trap door, causing Keith to plummet into the ocean.
 
         Pegasus in his Shadow Game with Yugi     
 As he planned, Pegasus ends up Dueling Yugi. Were Pegasus to win, Yugi's soul would be sealed in a card. Should Yugi win, Pegasus would release the souls of Yugi's grandfather and the Kaiba brothers. The Millennium Eye initially gives Pegasus a massive advantage, but Yugi and  Yami Yugi  are able to outsmart him by using a "Mind Shuffle" technique, where each of them play a card face-down and then switch to the other mind without letting the other know what card they played. After the Yugis destroyed Pegasus' card " Toon World ", giving them a small lead in Life Points, Pegasus draws them into a  Shadow Game . Although the game is too much for Yugi, causing him to collapse, Yami Yugi was still able to resist Pegasus's Eye with the aid of Yugi's friends reaching out to protect Yugi, allowing him to destroy Pegasus's Thousand-Eyes Restrict and win the Duel.
 
         Pegasus' and  Bakura 's Shadow Game.     
After his defeat, a downhearted Pegasus leaves for his sanctuary where, true to his word, he releases the souls of Solomon, Kaiba, and Mokuba, lamenting his failure to Cecelia. Shortly afterward,  Yami Bakura  confronts him and challenges him to another Shadow Game, with their respective Millennium Items on the line. Weakened from his Duel with Yugi and Yami, Pegasus loses easily, and Yami Bakura takes his Millennium Eye. This causes Pegasus to fall into a coma, and his last appearance in the arc is being carried out of his sanctuary by Kemo, presumably for medical care. 
 Dungeon Dice Monsters 
 Pegasus's disappearance after  Duelist Kingdom  hinders the release of  Dungeon Dice Monsters .  Duke Devlin  blames  Yugi  for Pegasus' disappearance and faces him in Dungeon Dice Monsters over it. Yugi manages to win using the " Dark Magician " Pegasus added, and shortly afterward it is revealed that Industrial Illusions plans to take Dungeon Dice Monsters global.
 Duke uses Pegasus' additions to the  KaibaCorp  computer system to his advantage, by adding Dungeon Dice original monsters to his Deck when he is trapped in the  Virtual World .
 
 Pyramid of Light 
         Pegasus Dueling with Kaiba.     
 These events take place after Battle City and before Waking The Dragons. Pegasus dreams of the impending danger as it enters his room to set its plan in motion. Soon after, Kaiba arrives and demands a way to defeat Yugi's three  Egyptian God Cards  since he knew Pegasus wouldn't let them go without a way to take them down. Pegasus admits to having a card that may work, but doesn't agree to Duel for it until after Kaiba wagers his three " Blue-Eyes White Dragons ". Though he uses his beloved  Toons , Pegasus is defeated after Kaiba uses " XYZ-Dragon Cannon " to destroy " Toon World " (which destroys the  toon monsters  as well) and attack him directly. Kaiba discovers two cards to take on the God Cards and doesn't believe Pegasus when he insists he only had  one . Pegasus investigates the  extra card  and discovers the history of  Anubis  and arrives just in time to save  Téa Gardner ,  Solomon Muto , and  Mokuba  from being crushed when Kaiba's Duel Dome starts to collapse. When Anubis reveals himself to Duel the Pharaoh and the building collapses further, Pegasus Summons " Blue-Eyes Toon Dragon " and " Toon Dark Magician Girl " to catch some falling debris before they are (goofishly) crushed.
 
 Waking the Dragons 
         Holographic Pegasus.     
 Pegasus returns in the  Waking the Dragons  arc and gathers info on  Paradius  company and the company's true intentions. Pegasus warned  Yugi  and his friends of the impending danger and also gives Yugi the card " Legend of Heart ", a key card leading to the defeat of  Dartz . His soul is taken by  Mai Valentine , but is restored by the end of the arc. When Dartz Summoned the " Mirror Knights ", Pegasus was one of the captured souls in the cards, along with Mai, Yugi, and  Joey Wheeler . He is eventually freed after  The Great Leviathan  is destroyed.
 
 KC Grand Championship 
 Though Pegasus doesn't make a physical appearance during this arc, he is mentioned several times. Firstly, when Yugi's group remember he paid for their flight to America. And Pegasus was later mentioned by Leon as the one personally responsible for creating the Fairy Tale cards Leon uses.  Zigfried  later gloats that his virus would wipe out KC's computer data, forcing Pegasus to sign a business contract with  Schroeder Corp ; though he is later foiled by the one weakness in " Golden Castle of Stromberg ", allowing the virus to cease its destruction of the KC computer data.
 
 Ceremonial Battle 
 Pegasus is told of the Ceremonial Battle towards the end of the series, where he gives a small narration of how  Yugi 's past adventures have led to this. He later makes a business deal with  Zigfried von Schroeder . (This is not shown in the dub.)
 
 Yu-Gi-Oh! GX 
         Pegasus talking to Chumley.     
         Pegasus greets  Jaden .     
 Shortly before finishing school,  Chumley Huffington  is called upon by Pegasus personally to work as a card designer for I² due to his successful card design submission of  Ayers Rock Sunrise . [4] 
 When  Franz , an I² employee, steals the only remaining copy of  The Winged Dragon of Ra  and controls it with  a field spell  he created and travels to  Duel Academy  to test it out on the participants of the  Genex Tournament . Pegasus and Chumley follow him to Duel Academy and end up working with Chumley's school chum,  Jaden Yuki , to track him down. After  Chancellor Sheppard  halts the tournament, the group finds Franz and Pegasus prepares to Duel him. Jaden steps in, however, and though he struggled at first against a God Card, he manages to hold his own. After seeing Ra in pain, Jaden declares he will save the monster from Franz' grasp and ends up destroying Ra and resurrecting to beat Franz. Pegasus watches the Duel in awe of Jaden's confidence and ability and even compares him to Yugi (much like Yugi's own  grandfather  had done before). After the Duel, Pegasus credits Franz for his work but tells him he would have to do things differently to continue at I². [5] 
 
         Pegasus dueling with his " Toon Kingdom " card.     
 Sometime later, he issues a  Triangle Duel  against  Dr. Crowler  and  Vice-Chancellor Bonaparte  for their right to work at Industrial Illusions, after the two believe themselves to be fired by Chancellor Sheppard. Pegasus wins the triangle Duel but accepts them as employees until Sheppard arrives and tells the two that they were not actually fired. Shortly afterward, Pegasus and Sheppard meet in private to discuss the threat of the " Ultimate D-Card " that was stolen from Aster's father. [6] 
 While watching Jaden Duel  Jesse Anderson ,  Aster Phoenix  recalls a meeting he had with Pegasus in which Pegasus reveals that his (then) "top five" Duelists were: 1.  Yugi Muto , 2.  Seto Kaiba , 3.  Joey Wheeler , 4.  Aster Phoenix , and 5.  Jesse Anderson . He explains that Jesse was the only Duelist who could use the " Crystal Beast " cards he had given him. However, Jesse did not have the " Rainbow Dragon " card as its tablet had not yet been discovered. While Jesse and everyone else at Duel Academy were trapped in another dimension, the tablet is discovered and Pegasus uses a high tech portable card designer to create the card right then and there. After it's finished, the card is transported to the other dimension so Jesse could use its power to take the school back home. [7] 
 Sometime later, when several cards stopped working on Duel Disks, he hired  Axel Brodie  to investigate. [8]  When  Nightshroud , the one behind the dysfunctional cards (and much more), Duels Jaden for the fate of the world, he tells him about the origins of the universe. Among other moments, Pegasus' discovery of the  Tablet of Lost Memories  is shown. [9] 
 
 Yu-Gi-Oh! 5D's 
 A poster for the  WRGP  lists one of its sponsors as the "Pegasus J. Crawford Memorial Foundation", suggesting that by  5D's  he had passed away. [10] 
 In the unaltered events of Bonds Beyond Time, an old article depicted the tournament that Pegasus held at Domino Plaza went smoothly without a problem. The article presented a photo showing that Yugi had won the tournament with Pegasus shaking his hand in congratulation.
 
 Altered timelines 
 Yu-Gi-Oh! 3D Bonds Beyond Time 
         Pegasus about to get crushed by a falling building.     
 Pegasus is the target of  Paradox , the main antagonist in  Yu-Gi-Oh! 3D Bonds Beyond Time . Here, Paradox aims to kill Pegasus using  Yusei Fudo 's " Stardust Dragon ", eliminating  Duel Monsters  from existence in order to prevent his future from being destroyed by  Synchro Summoning . When Paradox came to  Yugi Muto 's time during a tournament that Pegasus was hosting, he used his  Malefic  Dragons to destroy buildings in the plaza, resulting in Pegasus' death as he was crushed under a collapsing building, along with several other bystanders, including  Solomon Muto . Yugi then traveled back in time with  Yusei Fudo  and  Jaden Yuki  to a point prior to both Pegasus's arrival in Domino City and Paradox's, so that the three can defeat Paradox. After Paradox's defeat, Pegasus is then shown distributing cards at the event.
 
 
 Video games appearances 
         Pegasus as Sol Chevalsky.     
 Pegasus makes a number of appearances outside of the various  Yu-Gi-Oh!  anime and manga adaptions. He appears as an opponent in many of the video games, using his signature Toon themed Deck. His most prominent appearance in the video games is in  Yu-Gi-Oh! Reshef of Destruction , in which Pegasus once again appears as the main villain. Having found an ancient stone tablet, Pegasus is possessed by an ancient creature known as Reshef the Dark Being, and renames himself "Sol Chevalsky", alongside tying his hair. Using his resources, Pegasus summons forth all of his former minions, including the  Paradox Brothers  and  PaniK  from the Duelist Kingdom arc, and sends them to claim the Millennium Items while he prepares to free the Dark Being from its stone prison.
 Ishizu Ishtar  foresees the calamity that the Dark Being could unleash and recruits Yugi, Joey, and the player's character to put an end to Pegasus' evil plans. They eventually succeed in freeing Pegasus and defeating the Dark Being, but Reshef attempts to possess him again. Saddened by his evil actions, Pegasus allows the Dark Being to take his soul, telling Yugi and his friends to seal him away with Reshef trapped inside of him. Pegasus ultimately accepts his fate, expressing his gratitude at having faced such powerful Duelists before he is sealed into the stone tablet.

 Deck 
 Main article:  Maximillion Pegasus' Decks 
 Pegasus uses a  Toon /Illusion/Eyes-Restrict Deck  focused around the card " Toon World " which, in the manga and anime, is a one-of-a-kind card that allows him to play special  toon monsters . During  Duelist Kingdom , aside from his Toon cards, Pegasus utilizes control cards to disable enemy monsters, such as " Trap Displacement " and " Magical Neutralizing Force ", and cards that can turn an opponent's cards against them, such as a combo of " Dragon Capture Jar " and " Dragon Piper ", or " Doppleganger ". These cards take full advantage of Pegasus' mind-reading abilities to anticipate and counter his opponent's moves. As an extension of this control, Pegasus created the cards " Relinquished ", " Thousand-Eyes Restrict ", " Thousand-Eyes Idol ", and " Dark-Eyes Illusionist " specifically for his Duel with Yugi, the cards having the ability to block enemy attacks and absorb the power of Yugi's monsters.
