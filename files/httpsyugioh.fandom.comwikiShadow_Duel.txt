 Yu-Gi-Oh! 
 The first Shadow Duel to occur in the series was  Dark Yugi 's Duel with  Seto Kaiba  in the manga, during which the monsters were materialized and the loser suffered a Penalty Game. Kaiba was defeated and subjected to the Experience of Death.
 The next Shadow Duels took place between  Yami Yugi  and  Maximillion Pegasus  during the Duelist Kingdom arc. Pegasus Dueled Yami Yugi through a videotape and defeated him when the timer ran out before Yami Yugi launch a winning attack, capturing  Solomon Muto 's soul as a Penalty Game. The two later had a rematch as the prize of the finals of the Duelist Kingdom tournament, though it was not played as a Shadow Game until after " Toon World " was destroyed. This time, Yami Yugi was able to emerge victorious. Yami Yugi also played a Shadow Duel with  Yami Bakura  in the anime only, defeating him.
 Despite the claims of deathtraps that would send the loser to the  Shadow Realm  in the dub, most of the Duels played in the Battle City preliminaries weren't Shadow Games until Yami Bakura started a Shadow Duel against  Bonz . When  Yami Marik  took over  Marik Ishtar , more Shadow Duels began to appear, and all of the subsequent Duels that he took part in were Shadow Duels, save the four-way Duel to decide the semi-finals match-up. 
 During the Dawn of the Duel arc, Yami Bakura took part in two Shadow Duels, though these differed between the anime and the manga; Dueling  Seto Kaiba  inconclusively in the anime and  Jonouchi  in the manga, in addition to  Yugi Muto  in both versions. Only his Duel with Yugi ended conclusively; the others ended with no result.
 
 Yu-Gi-Oh! GX 
 Jaden Yuki  mentions that the King of Games,  Yugi Muto , faced many Shadow Duels and triumphed; the fact that Yugi took part in Duels involving magic thus appears to be common knowledge in GX. [1]  During Jaden's first Duel against  Nightshroud , he realized that Shadow Duels really existed. [2]  Unlike the Shadow Duels in the  Yu-Gi-Oh! , which were invoked with a  Millennium Item , these Duels were invoked by  spirits of Duel Monsters  or by  Shadow Charms . [2]

 Yu-Gi-Oh! 5D's 
 The  Dark Signers  are capable of turning Duels into Shadow Duels. When a Dark Signer engages in a Duel, the arena is surrounded by a barrier of light, taking the shape of the Dark Signers' corresponding  Nazca Line  and becomes a Shadow Duel. When a brainwashed Dark Signer servant engages in a Duel, the arena is instead surrounded by a circle-shaped purple glow. When a brainwashed person loses a Shadow Duel the  Dark Signers' mark  disappears and they return to their original state. 
 Shadow Duels are damaging to the Duelists and the blasts from the attacks can be fatal and often cause damage even to the surrounding observers and area;  Jack  and  Trudge  destroyed half a hospital. The Nazca Line shape around the area viciously tears up any objects in its path as it forms. However, such great power is also double-edged; if a Dark Signer loses a Shadow Duel (normal or Turbo), they die. It's also implied a Dark Signer's opponent will die regardless if they are actually hit by a fatal blast; in Carly's vision of beating Jack (which was not the real outcome), he fell off his  Duel Runner , dead.
 Many concepts similar to Shadow Dueling have existed throughout  Yu-Gi-Oh!  series, including the original  Shadow Games  of Duel Monsters, Dueling with the " The Seal of Orichalcos " and  Psychic Dueling , as well as the technology at the disposal of  Iliaster . Shadow Dueling is said to be similar to Psychic Dueling, but is much more powerful. However, unlike the past series, these Duels are never referred to as "Shadow Games."

 A  Shadow Turbo Duel  is a derivation of a normal Shadow Duel against a Dark Signer. Unlike a normal Shadow Duel, a Shadow Turbo Duel has one advantage;  Speed World  is active as a  Field Spell Card , thereby bypassing the requirement for one to be active to summon an  Earthbound Immortal .
 It possesses all the characteristics of basic Shadow Duels, except that it occurs within the rules of a  Turbo Duel . Like normal Shadow Duels, all impacts coming from monster attacks and effects are real. This can result in damage being dealt to a  Duel Runner , as with what occurred to  Yusei Fudo . However, if a Duel Runner breaks down, the duel is canceled regardless of the dark powers involved, leaving both alive.
 Another consequence of this dangerous kind of Turbo Dueling is that wherever the surroundings of the area on which the Nazca Line geoglyph materializes are destroyed. As long as a Shadow Turbo Duel is occurring, the materialized attacks of either players' monsters often indirectly results in the devastation of any objects in close proximity, as seen during the Shadow Turbo Duel between  Crow  and Greiger.
 The five Shadow Turbo Duels that have occurred have been  Yusei Fudo 's two Turbo Duels against  Kalin Kessler ,  Crow Hogan  against  Greiger ,  Jack Atlas  against  Carly Carmine  and Yusei, Jack and Crow against  Rex Goodwin .
 However, in the last Shadow Turbo Duel that occurred between Yusei, Jack and Crow versus  Rex Goodwin , Goodwin remained at the top of altar of the  Stairway to the Dragon Star , while Yusei, Jack and Crow drove their Duel Runners on the track formed by Goodwin's Condor geoglyph (quite literally, unlike past Shadow Turbo Duels where the geoglyph was only the barrier that formed the track). This is the only Turbo Duel so far in which one of the participants is not on a  Duel Runner  or a  Duel Board , but as with a Duel Board, as long as someone has a " Speed World " card they can use a Duel Disk.
 
 
 Yu-Gi-Oh! ZEXAL 
         Shadow Game Begin      In  Yu-Gi-Oh! ZEXAL ,  Vector , in his past life, initiated a Shadow Duel (which he referred to as a "Shadow Game") against  Shark/Nash , where whenever a player's monsters are destroyed, their respective armies would also lose some of its warriors. Though Nash was victorious, his entire army was decimated, due to the amount of his monsters that were destroyed. [3] 
 Similar to  Yu-Gi-Oh! 5D's , there are several other concepts similar to Shadow Duels in the series. The  Baria Sphere Cube  damages its occupants when they take damage inside it, and this effect is applied to the Earth when it begins to merge with the  Barian World . The souls of losing Duelists in the latter are sent to the Barian World. Dueling is also more intense in  Astral World , during which  Yuma  was blown off his feet simply after one of his  Defense Position  monsters was destroyed.
 It is important to note that while the  AR Vision  technology can apparently cause shockwaves that can harm Duelists, the damage from the Shadow Duel between Vector and Nash proved far more dangerous, as when either player took a hit in the Duel, the damage to the player was visibly more brutal.
 In the  Yu-Gi-Oh Zexal  manga, duels over number cards are referred to as Shadow Duels.
 
 
 Yu-Gi-Oh! ARC-V 
 In  Yu-Gi-Oh! ARC-V , while there is no direct mention of Shadow Duels, some elements are utilized in the  Action Duel  concept, in which the use of  Solid Vision  causes monsters to be physically materialized and landscapes changed according to the Action Field selected. Real damage is inflicted through shockwaves, and although harmful, they are not shown to be lethal. Noteworthy is that Duelists are allowed to physically assault the opponent, although such practices are rare. Shadow Duels have been implied when  Yuto  and later  Shay Obsidian  inflict damage without the use of an Action Field, though this appears to be a function of their Duel Disks. The only apparent mystical forms of shockwaves have occurred when  Yuya Sakaki  Summons " Odd-Eyes Rebellion Dragon ". The most prominent method that strongly correlates with that of a Shadow Duel are the Duels initiated by members of  Duel Academy , where the losing player is sealed in a card.
