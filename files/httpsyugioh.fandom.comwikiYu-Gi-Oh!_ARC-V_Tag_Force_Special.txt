 Trivia 
 For players outside Japan who wish to get the official, untranslated copy of this game, they only need to follow  these instructions . 
 A lot of the  Tag Force  exclusive characters are depicted in different outfits from different eras, such as Kami and Wisteria donning the  Obelisk Blue  uniform from  Yu-Gi-Oh! GX , and Bright wearing the original  Domino City  High School female uniform from the original series. 
 Similarly, original characters from  Yu-Gi-Oh! ZEXAL World Duel Carnival  all reapppear as  Yu-Gi-Oh! ARC-V  characters, with the students switching from the  Heartland Academy 's uniform to  Paradise Prep School 's one. 
 Yu-Gi-Oh! ARC-V Tag Force Special  is the only game in the  Yu-Gi-Oh! Tag Force  series to not have 3D animations of the characters or monsters. It is also the first Tag Force game to not have voices for every character. Only the characters with available storylines had voices in this game.
 Shunsuke Kazama , who voiced  Yami Yugi , was the only voice actor who did not reprise his role as his character. He was replaced with Kousuke Kujirai. 
 The characters with storylines from  Yu-Gi-Oh! GX  do not have lines for when they  Tribute Summon  a monster. This is most likely because this game uses prerecorded dialogues from  Yu-Gi-Oh! GX Tag Force ,  Yu-Gi-Oh! GX Tag Force 2 , and  Yu-Gi-Oh! GX Tag Force 3 , where the formal term for  Tribute Summon  in Japanese,  Release (リリース) , was not used in the  GX  era. 
 Jaden Yuki  is the only protagonist who does not have special dialogues for his  signature card ,  Elemental HERO Neos . This is also due to the likelihood that this game uses prerecorded dialogues from  Yu-Gi-Oh! GX Tag Force ,  Yu-Gi-Oh! GX Tag Force 2 , and  Yu-Gi-Oh! GX Tag Force 3 , none of which had Jaden give dialogues for his signature card. 
 This is the first  Tag Force  game to include characters from the  second series anime .
