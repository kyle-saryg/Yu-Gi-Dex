 In the dub, Captain Cutter speaks with a stereotypical pirate accent, though this was exposed by Sora when he said that Cutter was still dressing up. He quickly spoke in perfect English before resuming his pirate accent.
 
 Biography 
 When  Celina  brought the  Lancers  and  Zuzu  to a ship,  Sylvio  criticized it for being a pirate ship until Captain Solo came out. While sailing, more  Duel Academy  soldiers arrived by helicopter and Celina took Zuzu hostage. Meanwhile, Solo forced Yuya into a Duel while his crewmates tied Sylvio and  Gong  to the ship's mast. When Solo  Fusion Summoned  " Captain Lock ", he used the effect of "Lock" to prevent Yuya from summoning or setting monsters by unless a monster with 1000 or more ATK is on the field. He then threw a barrel at the action card Yuya was going for and grabbed it. He activated " Fire Gem ", inflicting to Yuya and tripped him so he can't get an action card. This backfire as Yuya found one but he took damage from " Cursed Gem " and Solo activated another "Fire Gem" giving Yuya more damage. When Yuya tried going for a third one on top of the ship, Solo forced the ship to turn making Yuya fall into the ocean. However, he, Sylvio, and Gong were saved when  Crow  and the rest of the  Lancers  arrived to Solo's annoyance. He activated " Battle at Sea " causing damage to Yuya while trying to sink their boat. When  Sora  joined the Duel, Solo tried to persuade him to come back, telling him that Celina did. However, Sora told Solo that they were taking Celina back and defeating him. He Fusion Summoned " Frightfur Kraken ", which causes the effect of "Lock" to activate and destroy itself. But, Solo brought "Lock" back with its effects negated and strengthened its ATK with " Perished Pirate ". When Yuya used " Performapal Teamwork " to equip " Performapal Sword Fish " to "Kraken", increasing its ATK, Sora used the effect of "Kraken" letting it attack twice per turn to destroy "Lock" and attack Solo directly. Solo then tried to chase after the Lancers, but the steering wheel came off after  Moon Shadow  took the screw holding it, causing the ship to flounder in a circle. [1]
