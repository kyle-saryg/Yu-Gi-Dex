 Champion Pack: Game Three  is the third in  Champion Pack  series in the Yu-Gi-Oh! Trading Card Game.
 « Building upon the success of the first two Champion Packs,  Champion Pack GAME THREE  spotlights popular foil versions of the best  Common  and  Rare  cards from previous tournament-winning  Decks . As a special bonus, the 20-card  Champion Pack GAME THREE  set introduces the fabled " Magicians Unite ," an  Ultra Rare   Spell Card  from the classic  Yu-Gi-Oh!  TV series. Never before released in America, this powerful card will surely excite not only dedicated Duelists, but also the show's legion of diehard fans. »
 Even though this Pack apparently was not released in Spanish, it is listed on the Spanish version of the official card database. Curiously, it uses the French name. [1]
