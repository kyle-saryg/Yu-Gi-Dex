 Biography 
 History 
 Akhenaden was the adviser and brother of Pharaoh  Akhenamkhanen . When Egypt was under attack and the invading armies grew too close to the palace to be repelled, Akhenaden suggested using a spell from the  Millennium Tome  to create the  Millennium Items . Faced with the undeniable fact his kingdom may be destroyed,  Akhenamkhanen  agreed.
 Akhenaden abandoned his son  Seto  and his wife for fear his actions would later cause them to become targets. Akhenaden led a group of soldiers to the village of  Kul Elna , where he ordered the thieves there to be killed, and their blood collected for the ritual to create the items. The only survivors of this slaughter were  the man who would become Tragoedia  and  Bakura . The slaughter was so horrific that Aknadin never told his brother of it.
 Akhenaden succeeded in crafting the  Millennium Items  and became holder of the  Millennium Eye . It was said that whoever wears the Millennium Eye is granted one wish, which Akhenaden doubted, but nevertheless wished for his son to become king. Upon the invading army's attack, Akhenaden, his brother and five other priests used the  Millennium Items  to hold them at bay and defeat them.
 Akhenaden remained a member of the High Priests after his brother died and his son  Atem  took the throne. Akhenaden also witnessed his son Seto's rise to power as a High Priest, the holder of the  Millennium Rod . Akhnaden was amazed his son had made his way from peasant to priest despite him abandoning him, and spent all his spare time training Seto, although he never told him they were related. Both Seto and  Atem  were unaware that they were cousins.
 
 Millennium World 
 Akhenaden took part of the exorcism of  Dark Spirit of Chaos , from  a criminal . He used the  Millennium Eye  to expose Dark Spirit of Chaos' true form. [1]  When the exorcism was complete, Seto suggested that the criminal be executed for the amusement of the pharaoh and to set a warning for future thieves. However Akhenaden argued that it was unnecessary, as the evil ka had been removed and that it was the duty of a priest to show mercy. He then sentenced the criminal to seven years hard labor. [2] 
 
When  Bakura, King of Thieves  attacked the royal palace and accused Atem's father of slaughtering his village, the High Priests denied such claims, but Akhenaden was horrified to realize Bakura must have survived the destruction, and as a result of the rage and evil that surely had taken root in him, the power of his ka " Diabound " would be nearly limitless. Using the power of his  Millennium Ring  to get past the guards, Bakura later attacked Akhenaden at the palace and promised Akhenaden's dark side would be brought out. It is implied that Bakura infused a part of  Zorc 's essence into Akhenadnen's eye. A future version of Akhenaden claiming to  be   Zorc Necrophades , sealed away into the Millennium Puzzle 3,000 years ago, later visits Akhenaden and tempts him into betraying his pharaoh he is unconscious.        Akhenadnen's future-self claims he is Zorc Necrophades.     Akhenaden's jealousy towards his brother is exposed by Zorc and he eventually becomes convinced that his son should be Pharaoh instead.
 Several prisoners were taken to the underground prison and forced to battle each other using their ka. When Akhenaden insisted on having  Kisara  battle, Seto stepped in to save her at the risk of his own life.
 Akhenaden accompanied the attack on  Kul Elna . Overseeing the events,  Dark Bakura  used an hourglass to freeze time, while Akhenaden collected the remaining  Millennium Items  from the incapacitated priests and placed them in the  Tablet of the Pharaoh's Memories  to call Zorc.
 
 Transformation into the Great Priest of Darkness 
 Zorc endowed Akhenaden with the power of the shadows by infusing him with a part of his soul, and transformed him into the High Priest of Darkness.
 Akhenaden fought along side Zorc, summoning an army of the undead, and teleported Seto to the palace. He proceeded to tell  Seto  of his royal lineage, encouraging him to join him and rule the world with him and Zorc.
 Akhenaden sealed  The White Dragon  in stone before killing Kisara. After Zorc was destroyed, he killed himself and Akhenaden sent his spirit into Seto, and controlled him to attack Atem, who had just arrived. Atem was overpowered, but the spirit of Kisara, in the form of The White Dragon entered Seto's mind, where she killed Akhenaden for good. At the end of the  Ceremonial Battle , Akhenaden is among the souls waiting for Atem in the underworld.
