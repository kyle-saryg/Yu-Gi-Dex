 Lyrics (TV Size) 
 Kanji Rōmaji English 
 
 ねえ 聞 かせえ　 君 の 好 きな 歌 はなに？ 
ねえ 例 えば　このままどこかへ 抜 けだして 
 心 臓 の ｂｌｕｅ を 隠 さずに 話 をしよう 
 ｙｅａｈ   起 きて 寝 て 
 最 高 の 日 にしよう 
 ｗｅｌｌ 、おいでおいで 
 誰 もが 誰 もが 寂 しくなったりするんだ 
 先 生 でも 何 にも 知 らない 
 親 友 でも 何 にも 知 らない 
 誰 にも 話 す 気 はない？ 
だけども 話 してよ 
 曖 昧 な 態 度 はいらない 
 悲 しみには 非 は 無 い 
 誰 にも 話 す 気 はない？ 
だけども 話 してよ 
 僕 には 話 してよ 
 誰 も 知 らない 君 を 
 先 生 でも 何 にも 知 らない 
 親 友 でも 何 にも 知 らない 
 誰 にも 話 す 気 はない？ 
 大丈夫 話 してよ 
 僕 には 教 えてよ
 
 
 
 Nee kikasete kimi no suki na uta wa nani? 
Nee tatoeba kono mama dokoka e nugedashite 
Shinzō no burū wo kakusazu ni hanashi wo shiyō 
Yē okite nete 
Saikō no hi ni shiyō 
Weru, oide, oide 
Daremo ga daremo ga samishiku nattari surunda 
Sensei demo nanni mo shiranai 
Shinyū demo nanni no shiranai 
Darenimo hanasu ki wa nai? 
Dakedo mo hanashite yo 
Aimai na taido wa iranai 
Kanashimi ni wa hi wa nai 
Darenimo hanasu ki wa nai? 
Dakedo mo hanashite yo 
Boku ni wa hanashite yo 
Daremo shiranai kimi wo 
Sensei demo nanni mo shiranai 
Shinyū demo nanni no shiranai 
Darenimo hanasu ki wa nai? 
Daijōbu hanashite yo 
Boku ni wa oshiete yo
 
 
 
 Hey tell me, what is your favorite song? 
Hey do you want to sneak out of here and go somewhere? 
Let's talk without whatever we have that's making us blue. 
Yeah! Wake up! Sleep! 
Let's have the greatest day! 
Well, come on over! 
No one should ever feel lonely! 
The teachers don't know anything at all! 
Your best friends don't know anything either! 
You don't want to tell anyone? 
But you should say something! 
No need to be vague about it! 
There's nothing wrong with being sad! 
You don't want to tell anyone? 
But you should say something! 
You can tell me! 
The you that no one else knows. 
The teachers don't know anything at all! 
Your best friends don't know anything either! 
You don't want to tell anyone? 
It's okay, say it. 
You can let me know.
