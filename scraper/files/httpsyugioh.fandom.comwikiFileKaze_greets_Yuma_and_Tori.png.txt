 "Yamikawa" means "river of darkness", and he was said to possess some darkness in his Duels, and had a " Number " card, which amplify the darkness in their owner's hearts.

 Biography 
 History 
 Kaze was a student at  Roku 's  Duel Sanctuary , but after Dueling him and losing his faith, he grabbed a sword and slashed a statue of " Blade Armor Ninja ", cutting it in half. Afterwards, he left the Duel Sanctuary and hadn't been seen since. [2] 
 
 Yu-Gi-Oh! ZEXAL 
 After  Yuma Tsukumo  and his friends went to the  Duel Sanctuary  to help  Roku  out, Kaze showed up again and challenged his former master to a Duel, which he easily won. He then ran inside and went to take the Legendary Deck, but was stopped by Yuma, who challenged him to a Duel. [3] 
 As the Duel progressed, both continued to overthrow each others' strategies and it was revealed that all of Kaze's hatred caused him to become possessed by a " Number " card, " Number 12: Crimson Shadow Armor Ninja ". Kaze ultimately lost when Yuma Summoned " Number 39: Utopia " and defeated his "Number". He then went to slash the statue again, but was stopped by Yuma who convinced him that it was wrong, to which he apologized and began to study at the Duel Sanctuary again. [2] 
 
 Yu-Gi-Oh! ZEXAL II 
 Barian Invasion 
       Kaze in  Yu-Gi-Oh! ZEXAL II .     
 When  Haru Tsukumo  sent  Yuma  back to the  Duel Sanctuary , Kaze answered the door and explained to him that Roku was away right now. In the Statue room, Kaze talked to Yuma about his frustrations and empathized with him by mentioning his own frustrations in the past. He told Yuma that he had been studying with Roku, and gave him two cards that Roku had left there for Yuma - " Overlay Chain " and " Overlay Barrage ". [4] 
 
 Legendary Number War 
       Kaze and Roku on TV.     
 When  Kiraku Souhachi 's statue was discovered, Kaze appeared on TV with Roku, presenting the artifacts that were also found. [5] 
 
 Barian Emperor Onslaught 
         Girag  vs. Kaze and  Roku .     
 After the  Barians  began to invade  Earth , Kaze and  Roku  became aware of the crisis in  Heartland  and went to aid  Yuma . When Yuma was rendered unable to Duel, they appeared and attacked the Emperors with smoke bombs, allowing Yuma to escape. When  Girag  attempted to give chase, they blocked his path and challenged him to a Duel. Kaze commented that Girag was no match against him and Roku combined, but Girag commenced a  Chaos Draw  alongside the other Emperors as he looked on in shock. [6]  This let him use " Rank-Up-Magic - The Seventh One " to bring out " Number C106: Giant Red Hand ". Kaze claimed that even if their bodies perished, the "blades of their hearts" would not be shattered. Girag defeated them both, with Kaze saying that he regretted nothing as their souls departed for the  Barian World . [7] 
 
         Kaze and Roku revived.     
 After  Nash  was defeated by Yuma, Kaze was revived as the fusion of Earth and the  Barian World  was stopped and the  Barian Pipe  released all the souls it contained. Kaze reappeared at the same spot where he and Roku were defeated by Girag and smiled towards the sky, knowing that Yuma saved them. [8]
