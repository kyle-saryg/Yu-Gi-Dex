 The card Kaiba wears around his neck 
 Does anyone know what card it is or its significance?  Danny Lilithborne  09:24, 25 October 2007 (UTC) 
 Its not actually a card, its a locket thing and inside it is a picture of mokuba as a little child, mokuba has one too but his has a picture of kaiba as a little kid. -- Ringed-Semi  09:59, 25 October 2007 (UTC) 
 Cards from the original movie 
 Is it worth noting cards that duelists use in the movie about the Red Eyes Black dragon? I was just wondering if we should list Evil Chain and Dark Zora in his deck, as well as Yugi having Meteor Dragon? Normally I would assume that not being canon it would be a no, but Yugi has cards listed from the first series and he doesn't have all of them listed there, so I wanted to know why none of the cards from the Red Eyes movie showed up? Vagrant Lustoid  06:26, 17 February 2008 (UTC)
 
 Pyramid of Light deck 
 In the talk page for  Yugi Moto , I asked whether it would be worthwhile listing the movie decks as seperate decks, due to the fact that the back of the Japanese novelisation has complete 40 card lists for Yugi, Kaiba and Pegasus, and as can be seen on that page, I was told it was worthwhile, so why has it been reverted now?

 year of birth 
 he was born on oct.25 but what year ?? does it say anywhere or in the gospel of truth??  —This unsigned comment was made by  Andy wheeler  ( talk  •  contribs ) 19:41, 8 October 2008 (UTC) 
 
 The Gospel of Truth doesn't give the years of birth. But I think Yu-Gi-Oh! is set in 1996 at the pilot and judging by the class he's in, he'd be about 16 years old. So that would make it around 1980 or 1979. That would be a logical guess, but it's not substantial proof enough to note it as his year of birth. --  Deltaneos  ( talk ) 09:26, 9 October 2008 (UTC) 
 Only Domino City survivor? 
 The article says that Seto is the only citizen of Domino City who survives Trueman's attack in season four of GX, but is there any proof of this? I've watched season four in its entirety and there's no evidence that the people who vanish are killed -- in fact I was under the assumption that they're all returned in one piece after Juudai defeats Darkness.
 64.13.15.31  08:09, 22 November 2008 (UTC)
 
 In one of the episodes, it shows a list of all residents on Domino City. During Trueman's attack, the peoples names on the list start to dissapear, and only Kaiba's name is left untouched. That shows how Trueman failed to defeat Kaiba.-- Sky Scourge God  03:53, 30 January 2009 (UTC) 
 Does that mean that Yugi lost but Kaiba didn't? 
 Yugi wasn't necessarily in Domino City during Trueman's attack. During Season 2, his grandfather mentions he's off on another adventure, so he still could have been by Season 4.  Cheesedude  ( talk  •  contribs ) 23:57, July 22, 2010 (UTC) 
 
Well I don't think that Yugi could have been defeated. I agree with the above saying that Kaiba was the only Domino city survivor, but I do believe Yugi, like Kaiba, wasn't defeated. He was probably away and therefore never lost a duel to Trueman
 
 Impressive for being so surprise, Captain Obviously... Yugi was never seen during Season 2, where his grandpa have mentioned that he was looking for his Grandson. Therefore Kaiba is only one remains there when Judai is dealing with Mr. T. -- F red C at   Ta.P.  •  F.P.  •  J.R.  •  W.S.  •  Th.P.  •  S.C.  23:49, December 22, 2010 (UTC) 
 Duelist Kingdom Briefcase cards... 
 I don't suppose someone who actually knows what they're doing could add a section for the cards he offered for Yugi's Grandpa's Blue-Eyes White Dragon in the first episode to his card listings, could he? The list is as follows:
 Skelgon
Giltia the D. Knight
Punished Eagle
Roaring Ocean Snake
Labyrinth Tank
Empress Judge
Block Attack
Mooyan Curry
Red Medicine
Polymerization
Remove Trap
Launcher Spider
Cyber Soldier
Monstrous Bird
Boulder Tortoise
Sea King Dragon
Togex
Flame Cerebrus
B. Dragon Jungle King
Air Eater
Battle Steer
Anthrosaurus
Millennium Golem (Cut off, but it's still clearly Millennium Golem.)
 
There's at least 2 other cards (likely at least 4...), but I don't think enough is visible of them to identify. Though, one of them may very well be Bolt Escargot. (It seemingly has 1400 ATK, or at least 14-something, and the small portion of the art that can be seen seems like it could match.)
 
 someone tell me kiabas height in weight in lbs and feet plz? i dont know how to read it the other way 
 It says that his weight is 65kg and his height is 186cm  i dont understand how to read stuff that way??? what i know is like 100lbs and 5foot  i dont know how to read it that way like 65KG and 186cm  —This unsigned comment was made by  67.234.159.115  ( talk  •  contribs ) 00:15, 17 May 2009 (UTC) 
 
 If you just hover the mouse over where it says his height and weight, it will show what they are in other units. (Can't you just learn metric units? They're much simplier and more practical than imperial units.) --  Deltaneos  ( talk ) 00:21, 17 May 2009 (UTC)
 I tryed hovering over with my mouse but it didnt show me anything and i cant learn it cause i dont know how to learn it lol plz can u just tell me?

 Any chance we can get a new, slightly better picture of Kaiba 
 particularly one with an actual background? ~MEOW~ Might of the BIRD Empire~~  04:39, 13 July 2009 (UTC)
 
 Priest Seto, or Evil Sorceror Seto? Stupid Ishizu 
 According to both Ishizu's stories, and the actual visions her Millennium Necklace showed Kaiba, Kaiba was actually an evil sorceror, and he betrayed the pharaoh. Then, when we're confronted with the Memory Arc and everything, nothing of the sort happens... So, can the Millennium Necklace (and thus Ishizu) not be trusted, or...?  —This unsigned comment was made by  Rose Duelist  ( talk  •  contribs ) 16:48, 13 October 2009 (UTC) 
 
 The writers didn't think that far ahead. --  Deltaneos  ( talk ) 17:53, October 13, 2009 (UTC) 
 Wow, well that sucks. Priest Seto & Pharaoh Atem did "do battle" in the manga, but it was merely the Pharaoh showing Seto that strength was not everything by using the Ka Kuriboh.  Rose Duelist  18:09, October 13, 2009 (UTC)
 I sound kinda like a nerd for saying this but yeah it is one thing that the writers definitely did not think that far ahead but one must also consider that whether it be manga or anime Aknadin was in control of Priest Seto when he challenged the Pharaoh as an "evil sorcerer" and the proof being that Aknadin had to have been already controlling him was in that Seto already had the Blue-Eyes White Dragon tablet. So, therefore Ishizu could have possibly not known that the priest was under the control of Aknadin and merely labeled him as an evil sorcerer because of his behavior towards the Pharaoh on the stone and in her visions. So the one at fault for not explaining to Ishizu this problem is the Millennium Necklace. -- White Dragon Kaiser  05:06, March 3, 2010(UTC)
 Then of course the error sets in where the Necklace's vision of the past battle is WAY off from the original fight in the Millennium World Arc but yeah, that was the writer's mess up.
 It wasn't a "mess up," per se, just that Takahashi was being pressured at the end to abandon his longer storyline. Apparently Kisara's demise at the hands of Aknadin would have lead to a subplot where Seto betrays Atem and goes off on his own with the intent to avenge her death. There were supposed to be three factions at the end: Atem and his court (minus Seto), Zorc and his followers, and Seto with his own agenda. But apparently the series was starting to get less popular (because there were less card games) and the editors wanted Takahashi to rush to finish the story...hence, Seto's rebellion against Atem and his romance with Kisara not being fully developed in the memory world arc.
 
 Trivia, regarding time between DM & GX 
 What proof is there that GX is set 10 years after the original Yu-Gi-Oh! 2nd series anime?  Rose Duelist  20:45, November 3, 2009 (UTC)
 
 How long have Kaiba tried to create those dorm in orders? How much it cost to building them with worker's strength (excluded one episode when two Channelers dueled to take down or keep Slifer Red)? Where's exact how Kaiba found an empty island to place those Duel Academy? So many questions, with few answers.  FredCat100  22:46, November 3, 2009 (UTC) 
 I'm guessing the first chapter of the Yu-Gi-Oh! manga is set in 1996, since that's the year it was written. The series probably ended in 2000. It being the Millennium seems fitting. I think (I could be wrong) in episode 156 of GX, we see 2004 as the year Jaden enrolled, which is also the year the episode where he enrolled first aired. That makes about an eight year gap between the starts of each series. --  Deltaneos  ( talk ) 12:55, November 6, 2009 (UTC) 
 Episode where Pegasus mentiones Kaiba as the second greatest duelist 
 Could someone tell me the Yu-Gi-Oh! GX  ep. where this happens? 
-- Bluemoonwhitenight  23:09, November 3, 2009 (UTC)
 
 During second season of GX, when Jesse/Jonan was mention that he's fifth champion, as Aster was talking about five top duelists. First was Yugi, second Seto, third Joey, fourth is Aster himself and fifth is Jesse. But I am sure this message will hit your head once you done read it.  FredCat100  22:48, November 3, 2009 (UTC) 
 Cool, in the second season, thanks for the heads up, but could you give me the ep. #, or at least the important events/duels in it? "But I am sure this message will hit your head once you done read it." No idea what that means, lol. 
 -- Bluemoonwhitenight  23:09, November 3, 2009 (UTC)
 
 Found it, in ep. 107, actually in the third season, but I couldn't have found it without your help, specifically the note about Jesse's appearance. Thanks!. :)     -- Bluemoonwhitenight  06:16, November 7, 2009 (UTC) 
 Possible continuity error 
 In  episode 143 , we see a flashback of Seto and Mokuba at the orphanage building a model theme park out of sand. Seto said that someday they'd open Kaiba Land theme parks all over the world. Was this an error as they couldn't have know their surname would turn out to be Kaiba or could it have happened after Gozaburo agreed to adopt them and before they left the orphanage? --  Deltaneos  ( talk ) 15:17, November 15, 2009 (UTC)
 
 Er, checked the Japanese version. It doesn't mention Kaiba Land. Probably a dub error. --  Deltaneos  ( talk ) 15:26, November 15, 2009 (UTC) 
 no it wasn't an error gozaburo was nice to them at first so they probably built it then or when they were waiting for Gozaburo to pick them up.  —This unsigned comment was made by  173.25.155.171  ( talk  •  contribs ) 19:11, 28 March 2010 (UTC) 
 Wasn't an error, 4kids made it that way to show another reason as to why the brothers were adopted by Gozaburo, Seto promised Mokuba to build a theme park just as a lot of kids do (kids dream big some want to build things or buys certain things when they are older). Seto knew Gozaburo would show up, im sure the orphanage people told them so they could get cleaned up and ready, seto saw his chance and took it. The sand model of the theme park was just them dreaming and before gozaburo came to the orphanage in fact it was the sand theme park that gave Seto the will to challenge the old man to a game of chess.  173.18.77.101  ( talk ) 17:41, May 29, 2012 (UTC)KiraAlanaAnuKaiba
 
 Triple Blue-Eyes - Kisara - Kaiba Connection? 
 It's already established of  Kisara  and her connection to the  Blue-Eyes White Dragon , but that only accounts for one of Kaiba's  Blue-Eyes , there are still two more of them to account for. Is there any talk about their origin's?  —This unsigned comment was made by  AvatarofDeath  ( talk  •  contribs ) 06:00, 18 April 2010 (UTC) 
 Hm... You got a good point there. I read around though and on the  Blue-Eyes Ultimate Dragon 's trivia page, it says that when Kaiba fused the three together in the Millennium World Arc, they represent  Kisara ,  Priest Seto  and his soul. Though that could just be because they were all there together at the time so that could and could not be for sure. -- White Dragon Kaiser  01:29, April 19, 2010 (UTC)
 
 What was the number of episode in Yu-Gi-Oh GX where Kaiba appeared with Chazz? 
 When reading the article, it stated:
 . He made several appearances, the first being when he made a bet on his ownership of the school. He seemed bold and had full confidence in the duelist representing Duel Academy, Chazz, would win despite the unfair advantage in the duel (in the Japanese episode, Kaiba stated at the end that anyone who was a student at his academy should be able to win a duel no matter what the situations are, and in the English version stated that Chazz's brothers needed to learn a little bit more about world domination). 
 What number or title of episode was that? I never saw this, and i don't know is it true or not, i thought he only appeared with Sartorius.  —This unsigned comment was made by  91.146.224.12  ( talk  •  contribs ) 07:47, 31 May 2010 (UTC) 
 
 episode 35 .  Cheesedude  13:34, May 31, 2010 (UTC) 
 Mrs. Kaiba? 
 Is there anything about Seto and Mokuba's mother?!?  198.109.124.3  ( talk ) 14:27, August 12, 2010 (UTC)
 
 Their biological mother died shortly after Mokuba was born, but she wouldn't have been called "Mrs. Kaiba". I'm not sure if this was mentioned in the anime, which is why it's not mentioned in the biography on this page.  Seto Kaiba in the manga  covers it. --  Deltaneos  ( talk ) 18:05, August 12, 2010 (UTC) 
 Impressed with Joey's performance 
 The following line:
 
 In the English version, Kaiba  thought  that Joey wasn't the third-rate amateur he thought he was. 
 Keeps being changed to:
 
 In the English version, Kaiba  finally realized  that Joey wasn't the third-rate amateur he thought he was. 
 I think it should left at the first version because, although I do think Joey is a good duelist, it's still an opinion not a fact. 
This part has also been changed:
 
 Kaiba was impressed 
 to
 
 Kaiba was,  surprisingly, extremely  impressed 
 Who is it saying was surprised by him being impressed? None of the characters took any notice of him being impressed. I don't think we should include fans' opinions in the biography and we can't assume all fans were surprised by it (I wasn't). I don't think he was "extremely" impressed either. You can see a screenshot of his expression  here  (128x105). In the English version, he even said "Wheeler's performance was 'quite' impressive". He did seem more impressed in the Japanese, but I'm not sure about "extremely". I don't think an adjective is particularly needed anyway. --  Deltaneos  ( talk ) 20:29, October 17, 2010 (UTC)
 
 Age 
 I may be wrong but isn't Kaiba seventeen? His father went missing when he was around twelve and he was gone for five years so if my calculations are right is he not seventeen? I may be wrong but this is just what I think.  —This unsigned comment was made by  67.225.96.20  ( talk  •  contribs ) 22:40, 16 November 2010 (UTC) 
 
 I think the only time his age was ever mentioned was when he was adopted. He was ten at that time. Although the English dubbers changed that to twelve. I don't think it explicitly stated how much time passed since then. He was in the same class as Yugi, Anzu (Téa), Jonouchi (Joey) and Honda (Tristan), so should be about the same age as them and we know Jonouchi was sixteen near the start of the manga (" " Get the Million!! " "). --  Deltaneos  ( talk ) 00:06, November 17, 2010 (UTC) 
 Switchblade Scene 
 What Was The Switchblade Scene?
 
 Movie 
 Why is nothing said about his duel against Yugi in the Movie (2004)? If Anubis wouldn`t have stopped the duel he would even have  beaten Yugi.-- 93.128.5.182  ( talk ) 23:24, December 10, 2011 (UTC)
 
 His place was interrupted by Anubis, but still counted to be in the article. -- F r e d C a t  23:31, December 10, 2011 (UTC) 
 I believe it's because the movie is non-canon. The info on it should go on the  Seto Kaiba in non-canon  page if one is ever created.  Cheesedude  ( talk  •  contribs ) 00:26, December 11, 2011 (UTC) 
 It could be taken as part of the canon because it doesn't contradict the series' canon. But even if it's not his appearance in the movie should be mentioned because his unimportant appearences in GX are too.-- 93.128.90.34  ( talk ) 17:57, December 12, 2011 (UTC) 
 Not contradicting series canon != automatically canon. The events of the movie were never mentioned again in the series, nor did some of the cards that made their debut in said movie; Blue-Eyes Shining Dragon and Pyramid of Light come to mind, though in the latter case the card may have been destroyed along with Anubis, though this guesswork on my part, really. That said, I agree with Cheesedude.  Lord Grammaticus  ( talk  •  contribs ) 18:01, December 12, 2011 (UTC) 
 I don't know if it's canon or not but I wouldn't either say that GX is canon. And if Kaibas cameos in GX where he only say one or two sentences are listed, there should be  a section about his appearence in the movie as well. It hasn't to be long.-- 93.128.90.34  ( talk ) 21:42, December 12, 2011 (UTC) 
 The "Second series anime biography" section isn't about listing his most important appearances, so his role in  Pyramid of Light  being bigger than his role in  GX  is of no significance. It's about listing his biography in everything deemed canon to the second series anime. Whether or not the film is canon is what's significant. If it is canon, then it can be listed there. If it's not canon it's still important, so should be listed in a "Non-canon appearances" section like  Solomon Muto#Non-canon appearances  or  Yugi Muto#Non-canon appearances  and like Cheesedude said a  Seto Kaiba in non-canon  page can be created, like the  Yugi Muto in non-canon  page. --  Deltaneos  ( talk ) 22:12, December 12, 2011 (UTC) 
 And given how events proceed after the second series, one could easily remove it from the point it took place in the timeline and get little difference, if any.  Lord Grammaticus  ( talk  •  contribs ) 22:38, December 12, 2011 (UTC) 
 And what about a neutral section, not mentioning if it's canon or not. At the bottom of the article with the topic " Kaiba in the movie"?-- 77.13.148.152  ( talk ) 10:31, December 13, 2011 (UTC) 
 There's a forum on the subject of what is and isn't considered canon over at  Forum:Canon . If anyone wants to comment they can do so. --  Deltaneos  ( talk ) 21:37, December 23, 2011 (UTC)

 Base on his age and how anime's date set up - that's how they learned his birth Year. It's actually 10/25, not 10/28, by the way. -- F r e d C a t  18:25, March 18, 2012 (UTC)

 Glad to helping. -- F r e d C a t  23:54, March 19, 2012 (UTC) 
 Jonouchi is 16 in  Duel 42 . It's definitely summer in Duels  45 ,  46  and  47 . The year 1997 is printed on the yo-yos in  Duel 48 . So Jonouchi seems to be 16 in summer 1997 and since his birthday is in January, that implies he was born in 1981. Kaiba was in Jonouchi's class in school, so it's assumed that he's the same age as Jonouchi at the start of the school year. Since Kaiba's birthday is in October, he must have been born the year before to be the same age at the start of the school year, making his birth year 1980. While I'm sure 1980 is his birth year, there's two assumptions in that deduction, so I wouldn't object to it being removed from the article. --  Deltaneos  ( talk ) 00:14, March 20, 2012 (UTC)
 That's the whole explain of how we knew Seto's birthday date... Kiumaru just don't know how you did that way - at least it's confirmed to be true. -- F r e d C a t  00:19, March 20, 2012 (UTC)

 Green hair 
 Why did you someone remove my explanation about Kaiba having Green hair in the first Toei's anime version ? It is kind of an important change and can be explained easily. This page is an encyclopedia as far as I know, it should be the most complete source of information about the character of all the web. 
 "In the Toei anime, Kaiba has green hair. The Toei's version of the anime run for the first time in April 1998, while the fourth volume of the manga - kaiba revenge - was released September the fourth, in 1997. In that fourth volume, Kaiba is clearly depicted as having brown hair in one of the color page of the Chapter 27. The creators of the show may have known Kaiba had brown hair from the beginning. One possible explanation is that Green is the color of envy in western culture and english-speaking countries." Thugcat  ( talk  •  contribs ) 13:26, March 4, 2015 (UTC)

 It wasn't. That was just someone vandalizing, and it's been reverted.  Sanokal K-T  ( talk  •  contribs ) 23:44, July 22, 2015 (UTC) 
 I have 2 questions. 
 The whole section: "The Dark Side of Dimensions" in both Seto Kaiba's anime character page & his manga counter part is different. While the events are still pretty much the same right?
 Also: In the same section for Seto Kaiba's anime version's it states: "Whether he is able to return is ambiguous". While yes, it was slightly ambiguous. Should it not be obvious that he was able to return? (I mean: How else could he be in GX when GX was obviously set AFTER the movie.) Xavierfelinaty  ( talk  •  contribs ) 10:57, September 30, 2019 (UTC)
 
DSOD is not canon to the anime's events and cause of such events play out way different from how they did in the manga's timeline.
