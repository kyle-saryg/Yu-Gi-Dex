 Biography 
 Shark  invited  Tokunosuke  for the team, but told him that to enter he had to defeat a  Dueling Team  leader first. Tokunosuke then faces  Yuma , leader of  Team ZEXAL , for that, but ends up losing. At that moment, Shark and the other members arrive and reveal that they never intended to let Tokunosuke in, and despised him. [1]  Yuma and the members of Team ZEXAL defend Tokunosuke, and because of that Shark challenges Yuma for a  Duel , under 2 conditions: betting their Team Badges and Tokunosuke, who he intended to use as a slave if he won. Yuma accepts, and they Duel. [2]  Although Yuma loses, when Shark is about to take his Team Badge, he notes Yuma should have won, and frustrated, declares that the match was a non-count. [3] 
 Team Shark later enters the  Team Duel Tournament , and is the first team to advance to the finals. [4]
