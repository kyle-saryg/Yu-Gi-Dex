 " Grandsoil the Elemental Lord " appears in this card's artwork. 
 This card's  OCG  name, " a bolt from the blue ", is an idiom to speak about something that you do not expect to happen and that surprises you very much, like a  bolt of lightning from a clear blue sky . The effect and the artwork of this card reflect this meaning. 
 This card's  TCG  name is a reference to the iconic phrase from the  Pokémon  games, " A  wild Pokémon  appeared! ", due to the sudden appearance of "Grandsoil" in this card's artwork.
