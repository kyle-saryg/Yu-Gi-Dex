 Yu-Gi-Oh! VRAINS 
 In  episode 106 ,  Ghost Gal  uses this card during her  Tag-Team   Speed Duel  with  The Shepherd  against  Roboppi . When she  Link Summons  an " Altergeist " monster, Ghost Gal activates this card's effect, Special Summoning itself from the hand to one of the  Link Points  of Shepherd's " Battledrone General ". This card's other effect then treats Shepherd's " Battledrone Warrant " as an "Altergeist" monster, allowing Ghost Gal to link this card and " Altergeist Pookuery " (from her hand due to its own effect) with  Link-2  "Warrant" to Link Summon " Altergeist Memorygant ".
