 Biography 
 Pre-Arc League Championship 
 Kakimoto was first seen soon after  Sylvio  took  Yuya  to  LID . Kakimoto wished to see Yuya's Pendulum monsters, but Sylvio wouldn't allow him to keep them. He later helped Sylvio capture Yuya's friends and witnessed the ensuing Duel, [1]  and was surprised to see Sylvio lose. Kakimoto, Ootomo, and Yamabe tried to attack Yuya but all three got knocked out by  Sora Perse . [2] 
 Later on, Kakimoto lost to Sylvio in a Duel. Kakimoto wondered why he lost to Sylvio's Deck, but Sylvio told him that it wasn't the deck but the duelist that defeated Kakimoto. He, Sylvio, Ootomo, and Yamabe began to fool around after that. After Ootomo and Yamabe brought Sylvio some food, Kakimoto witnessed Sylvio Duel and lose against  Yuto . [3] 
 Kakimoto and his friends visited Sylvio in the hospital and spread the word that Yuya was the one who attacked him. Claude rewarded the LID students by giving them rare cards. [4] 
 
 Arc League Championship 
 Kakimoto, Yamabe and Ootomo were seen watching Sylvio's rematch with Yuya at the Arc League Championship, and were impressed by Sylvio's new Pendulum Monsters.  [5] 
 
 Duel Academy 
 After  Z-ARC 's defeat and the  Standard Dimension  being reborn into the  "Pendulum Dimension" , Kakimoto is seen watching  Yuya 's Duel against  Jack Atlas  with  Ootomo  and  Yamabe . [6]  He cheered when Yuya won and watched Yuya and  Declan 's  Action Duel . [7]  He was happy when Yuya won the Duel and witnessed  Zuzu 's revival. [8] 
 
 Deck 
 The only known card shown in Kakimoto's Deck is " Power Dart Striker ". This is likely due to Sylvio changing his Deck and giving his old rare cards to his friends.
