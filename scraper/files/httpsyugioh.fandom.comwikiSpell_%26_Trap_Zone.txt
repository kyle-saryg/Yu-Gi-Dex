 Spell & Trap Zones  ( 魔 法 ＆ 罠 ゾーン  Mahō & Torappu Zōn  "Magic & Trap Zone"), formerly  Spell & Trap Card Zones  ( 魔 法 ＆ 罠 カードゾーン  Mahō & Torappu Kādo Zōn  "Magic & Trap Card Zone"), are the 5  Zones  in which  Spell  and  Trap Cards  can be placed on the  field  (except  Field Spell Cards , which are placed in the  Field Zone ). They are located in the middle of the field behind the  Monster Zones ; for this reason, they are also sometimes unofficially referred to as "backrow." On game mats, they are often colored cyan.
 If all Spell & Trap Zones are occupied or  rendered unusable , new Spell/Trap Cards (other than Field Spell Cards) cannot be activated or Set, as there must be a usable vacant Spell & Trap Zone to place the card in (before the activation). Cards cannot be moved between Spell & Trap Zones.

 Trap Monsters 
 Main article:  Trap Monster s
 A  Trap Monster  requires both a Spell & Trap Zone and a  Monster Zone , due to the fact that it is simultaneously treated as both a Trap Card and a  Monster Card . [3]  However, it is placed in the Monster Zone, and despite the Spell & Trap Zone being unusable, it is not considered occupied (for the purposes of cards such as " Straight Flush " and " D/D/D Dragonbane King Beowulf "). [4] 
 If a Trap Monster is  flipped   face-down  (" Book of Moon " or " Cyber Shadow Gardna ", etc.) or has its Trap effect negated (" Jinzo ", etc.), it returns to that associated Spell & Trap Zone as a Trap Card. [5] 
 
 Pendulum Zones 
 Current field 
 The leftmost and rightmost Spell & Trap Zones are also used as  Pendulum Zones . These Zones are treated as Pendulum Zones only while there is a Pendulum Monster in that zone (but are not treated as Pendulum Zones if the Pendulum Monster is in that zone as an  Equip Spell Card ). If there is a Pendulum Monster in the zone, it is treated as both a Spell & Trap Zone and a Pendulum Zone. If one of these Zones has a Pendulum Monster in it while the other does not, only the zone with a Pendulum Monster in it is treated as a Pendulum Zone.
 
 
 Old field 
 Prior to the release of  Starter Deck 2017  in the  OCG  and  Starter Deck: Link Strike  in the  TCG , the  Pendulum Zones  were distinct zones in which only Pendulum Monsters could be placed. These zones were not treated as Spell & Trap Zones, and Pendulum Monsters could not be placed in the Spell & Trap Zones.
