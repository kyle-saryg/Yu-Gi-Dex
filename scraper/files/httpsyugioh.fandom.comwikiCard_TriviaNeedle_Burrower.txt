 This card appears to be a stronger version of " KA-2 Des Scissors ".
 " Flamvell Grunika " and " Stygian Street Patrol " also have an identical level-damaging effect, albeit these cards' damage denominations per level are less. 
 This card's effect is the opposite of " Absorbing Kid from the Sky ".
