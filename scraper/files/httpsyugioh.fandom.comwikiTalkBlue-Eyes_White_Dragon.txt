 Why the LOB BEWD must be in the page? The traditional picture is very beautful...-- Seto Kaiba  ( Seto Kaiba ) 21:21, 13 April 2007 
 It's policy for all cards to use their first printed edition, in a Booster Set.-- TwoTailedFox  ( My Talk Page ) 23:42, 14 April 2007 (UTC) 
 Didn't this card come out in a deck or Dark Duel Stories first?  Big Boss 0  02:54, 18 April 2007 (UTC)
 Well here's the best info... I'd say that LOB being the first booster makes it the original card.. but I guess it could be debated.

 UPDATED** 
 LOB - March 8, 2002
DDS - March 19, 2002
SDK - March 29, 2002
 LOB was released prior to DDS and SDK thus LOB must be the original card. Thus the LOB card stays as the image for Blue-Eyes White Dragon. -- Pcouw  17:48, 25 April 2007 (UTC)
 Can someone tell me what LOB stands for?  How are each of the 3 versions (or are there 4?) of the BEWD officially named?
 
 LOB stands for  Legend of Blue Eyes White Dragon  There are loads of different versions of BEWD. ( see here ). All English ones are officially named Blue-Eyes White Dragon. -- Deltaneos  21:14, 22 August 2007 (UTC)

 Swedish 
 The Swedish name given on the page is wrong. Should I correct it or remove it? I think Swedish card names are unnecessary since the Yu-Gi-Oh! TCG is played with English cards in Sweden, and English names are used in the Anime.  Rainyday2012  16:42, 2 June 2008 (UTC)
 
 Card Image Not Real? 
 I'm probably not the first person to notice this, but I think the current card image isn't real.  Don't get me wrong, it looks incredible, but it's still fake.  PaladinJain  01:59, 14 December 2008 (UTC)
 
 Well, I don't know about fake, but I certainly see some oddities that seem to apply to all of the cards in the  Anniversary Pack  aside from the new dramatic artworks by  Kazuki Takahashi . The standard artwork border is missing, and the flavor text isn't written in  Italic  like it should. Also, I don't remember seeing any cards with signed artworks before, but that's not necissarily an error. It seems that these differences from the norm are intentional, save the flavor text not being in  Italic . --  Melik el-Al'ab  09:16, 14 December 2008 (UTC) 
 Oops, sorry about that.  I guess I jumped the gun a little bit.  I just noticed those oddities and assumed it was a fan creation.  I apologize.  PaladinJain  17:23, 14 December 2008 (UTC) 
 There's no need to apologize. It really  does  look like a fan creation! --  Melik el-Al'ab  17:32, 14 December 2008 (UTC) 
 Or you rather same old bored stuff again and again? Let it out of bar and breathe some real words. -- F red C at   His litter  •  FR  23:43, August 14, 2010 (UTC) 
 Current Picture 
 Should'nt this page be using it's picture from the first time it was printed in a booster set, which was LOB?  Right now it's using the DPKB picture.  SuperKirbyFan  ( talk  •  contribs ) 19:29, December 18, 2010 (UTC)
 
 Consensus is to use the most recently released English image.  Cheesedude  ( talk  •  contribs ) 19:52, December 18, 2010 (UTC) 
 In that case, shouldn't we be using the image from the Legendary Collection?  SuperKirbyFan  ( talk  •  contribs ) 22:55, December 18, 2010 (UTC)
 Yes. Not sure if anyone has uploaded the image for that or if it simply wasn't changed because no one bothered.  Cheesedude  ( talk  •  contribs ) 01:20, December 19, 2010 (UTC) 
 Ultra Rare or UR 
 To prevent the edit-warring; I am wishing to know why  one user  rather full words over Abbreviate code? They work the same and the Abbreviate is shorter that saved allot of characteristic space... -- i F r e d C a t  01:43, August 27, 2012 (UTC)
 
 I prefer the abbreviations, if every single card page has it why should this be special and don't have it?-- E. G.G.  ( My Contributions ) 12:03, August 27, 2012 (UTC) 
 That's why I asked, that user just being stubborn and reverted it twice. Thank you for commenting. -- i F r e d C a t  12:10, August 27, 2012 (UTC) 
 It was agreed that we use the abbreviation at  Forum:Redirect changing: Necessary or not? 
 There's no reason to use the full link (at least not until  Forum:Card article redesign  is being applied).  - Falzar FZ - ( talk page | useful stuff )  14:02, August 27, 2012 (UTC) 
 Normally I wouldn't mind, but all other pages are unabbreviated on the video game card pack rarities. Was just going for consistency.-- Azul120  ( talk  •  contribs ) 17:09, August 27, 2012 (UTC) 
 Naturally, they are better being abbreviating than unabbreviating - it saved allot of characteristic space. All other Booster name that listed there are what we should  not  abbreviating because of names in various language, not Rarity - they are unchanged in any place. -- i F r e d C a t  17:11, August 27, 2012 (UTC) 
 I was talking about the card rarities, not the booster names themselves. What I meant was the other card entries have unabbreviated rarities corresponding to video game packs.-- Azul120  ( talk  •  contribs ) 17:29, August 27, 2012 (UTC) 
 Again, either this should go back to unabbreviated under the video game card pack rarities (i. e. Nightmare Troubadour, WC2006, etc.), or all other card pages should have corresponding rarities abbreviated as well.-- Azul120  ( talk  •  contribs ) 23:06, September 2, 2012 (UTC) 
 Name Error 
 How can I correct the Croatian name? The one given currently does match the original anime dub series, but as same as all the other cards presented there, the general translation is wrong. -- Hawk00Refferencer  ( talk  •  contribs ) 21:16, May 6, 2013 (UTC)Hawk00Refferencer
 
 Get an image of Croatian version of this card, then type them down as you upload the picture in. We also required an official source for that - otherwise, your effort went fruitless. Thank you for bring up a question. -- i F r e d C a t  21:19, May 6, 2013 (UTC) 
 That's the problem: there is no "real" card with a Croatian lore, but there are people using Croatian names vocally. The problem is that the initial dub version of the anime in Croatia had made quite a lot of errors in translation (most notable example being renaming "Embodiment of Apophis" into what can directly be translated as "Lamprey"), this card included. The naming section of this page does mention this error, as the current name translates into "Blue-eyed Blueish Dragon" while the correct name should be "Plavooki Bijeli Zmaj", meaning "Blue-eyed White Dragon". since there is no printed Croatian card (aside from fan-made ones), vocal translation is the only valid source.  Hawk00Refferencer  ( talk  •  contribs ) 21:28, May 6, 2013 (UTC) 
 Then have a talk with Admins - I am just a Mover and I can't move the whole article into "Plavooki Bijeli Zmaj" in the way you wanted it. -- i F r e d C a t  21:30, May 6, 2013 (UTC) 
 I think the problem Hawk00Refferencer initially brought up is that he cannot edit the page. That's because it has been locked from editing, to prevent vandalism. Autoconfirmed users are able to edit this page. I think that means your account needs to be at least four days old and have made at least ten edits. 
 Is "Plavooki Bijeli Zmaj" the name used from Battle City onwards? If so, I can change the name now and mention that it was your suggestion in my edit summary, if you want. If you'd rather wait the four days and do it yourself, that's fine too. --  Deltaneos  ( talk ) 22:05, May 6, 2013 (UTC) 
 I'm not 100% sure if 4 days and 10 edits in the minimum criteria. I think I've seen users become autoconfirmed faster than that. --  Deltaneos  ( talk ) 22:06, May 6, 2013 (UTC) 
 I will keep that in mind. I am pretty sure they used a different set of voiceactors and a different terminology from Battle City onward, but the actual show has not made much progress in my country. Ever since then, cardnames have not been translated in Croatian dubs from their English names, a concept that I do not aproove myself as it can barely be considered a dub then (for example, it would be the same as someone in the English dub saying "I štimati my Ratnik and Zmaj to Synchro summon Togitog Zmaja"), so every card from GX era and onward was left to free judgment of Croatian translators. Still, "Bijeli" instead of "Modri" would be a correct translation. I would hate myself if they remembered my nation as a bunch of dunces and cowards that don't know the first thing about translating things. That's why so many contributors is donating these translations.-- 93.138.186.82  ( talk ) 22:28, May 6, 2013 (UTC) 
 Bah, sorry about that, I forgot to log in upon signing.--Hawk00Refferencer 22:31, May 6, 2013 (UTC) 
 Different artwork versions 
 You should include all different artwork prints for collectors who want info on a specific print like how I'm looking for the Blue-Eyes White from JMP-001 & DTP1-EN001, it is the only version I'm missing.
