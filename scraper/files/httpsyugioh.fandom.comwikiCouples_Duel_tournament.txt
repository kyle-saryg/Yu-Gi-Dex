 The  Couples Duel tournament , known as the  Couple Duel Tournament  in the Japanese version, is a  Tag-Team Duel  tournament which took place in  Heartland Academy 's fun fair in the  Yu-Gi-Oh! ZEXAL  anime.  [1] 
 The tournament was hosted by  Brooke Walker  and her husband,  Mayday Walker . Wanting to be in the tournament,  Anna Kaboom  stole  Tori Meadows ' school uniform so that she could enter the tournament, and she also coerced  Yuma Tsukumo  to be her partner. Though it seemed innocuous, the tournament took on a sinister note, as Brooke had been hypnotized by  Vector  and given " Rank-Up-Magic Barian's Force ". [1]  During the Duel, Yuma and Anna initially had difficulty working together, due to the latter's selfishness. Brooke eventually used "Barian's Force" to call forth a " CXyz ". After Anna played " Devoted Love " to help Yuma draw " Rank-Up-Magic Limited Barian's Force ", Yuma used it to Summon " Number C39: Utopia Ray V " and defeat Brooke and Mayday. [2]
