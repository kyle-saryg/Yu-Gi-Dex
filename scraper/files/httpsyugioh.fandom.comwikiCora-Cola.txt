 Appearances 
 While  Yugi  and  Jonouchi  were at the arcade, Jonouchi bought drinks, including a cola for Yugi. Only the "Cola" part of the was visible on the can, but it was printed in the same style as "Coca-Cola" and "Cora-Cola". Jonouchi chased after  Street Fighter , after finding he had beaten-up Yugi and stolen the  Millennium Puzzle , and wound up in a fight. Since the cola had been shaken a lot in his pocket, when Jonouchi opened the can, the drink sprayed out, hitting Street Fighter in the face. [1] 
 When Yugi,  Anzu , Jonouchi and  Sugoroku  sat down to watch the  Japanese National Duel Monsters Championship  on TV, an ad for Cora-Cola was on. [2] 
 During Battle City,  Dark Yugi  and  Kaiba  walked past a building with a Cora-Cola banner on its wall. [3]
