 " Ready for the Rush!" ,  known as " Let's Do This! Rush Duel! " in the original Japanese version, is the first episode of  Yu-Gi-Oh! SEVENS  anime. It aired in Japan on TV Tokyo on April 4, 2020. In the United States, the English dub aired on Disney XD on June 6, 2022.
 Yuga Ohdo  dreams of changing the rigid and restrictive Dueling world with his inventions, which he calls "roads." One day, Yuga learns about a legend from  Luke , his classmate from the next class over, who wants to become the Duel King. The two of them arrive at a mysterious monument and find the  Hologram Man  waiting for them. In order to be recognized as the "Duel King," Yuga must win within the time limit and install the new rules!
 
 Featured Duel: Yuga Ohdo vs. Hologram Man 
       Yuga VS. Hologram Man.     
 The Duel is conducted as a  Rush Duel .
 Turn 1: Yuga Ohdo 
Yuga draws " High Magic - Double Accel ". His hand contains " Dark Sorcerer ", " Magical Beast Wolfram ", " Spell Archer ", "High Magic - Double Accel" and " Wind Spirit's Blessing ". Yuga  Normal Summons  "Dark Sorcerer" (Level 4/1500/0), "Magical Beast Wolfram" (Level 3/1100/100) and "Spell Archer" (Level 3/1000/400). He then sets "High Magic - Double Accel" and "Wind Spirit's Blessing".
 Turn 2: Hologram Man 
The Hologram Man Normal Summons " Lesser Dragon " (Level 4/1200/1000) and " Lizard Soldier " (Level 3/1100/800). He then tributes "Lesser Dragon" and "Lizard Soldier" to  Tribute Summon  " Blue-Eyes White Dragon " (Level 8/3000/2500) in Attack Position. As he controls a Level 7 or higher  Dragon   Normal Monster , he activates the  Normal Spell Card  " Traditional Burst Breath ", which lets him destroy all face-up Level 6 or lower monsters Yuga controls. "Blue-Eyes White Dragon" attacks  directly  (Yuga: 4000 → 1000  LP ).
 Turn 3: Yuga Ohdo 
As Yuga has no cards in his hand, he draws five cards: " Answerer the Demonic Swordsman ", " Hydro Magician ", " Stray Familiar ", " Mystic Dealer " and " Curtain of Sparks ". He Normal Summons "Stray Familiar" (Level 1/0/1400) and "Mystic Dealer" (Level 3/1000/0). Yuga activates the effect of "Mystic Dealer", letting him send a  Spellcaster  monster from his hand to the  GY  to draw a card. He sends "Answerer" and draws " Sevens Road Magician ". He then tributes "Stray Familiar" and "Mystic Dealer" to Tribute Summon "Sevens Road Magician" (Level 7/2100/1500) in Attack Position.
 Yuga activates his set card "Wind Spirit's Blessing", letting him send 1 card from his hand to the GY to increase the ATK of a Spellcaster monster he controls by 1000 until the End Phase. He sends "Hydro Magician" and targets "Sevens Road Magician" ("Sevens Road Magician": 2100 → 3100 ATK). He then activates his set card "High Magic - Double Accel", letting him return 2 Level 5 or higher Spellcaster monsters from his GY to his Deck to have 1 Spellcaster monster he controls gain ATK equal to its original ATK. He returns "Answerer" and "Hydro Magician" and targets "Sevens Road Magician" ("Sevens Road Magician": 3100 → 5200 ATK). Yuga activates the effect of "Sevens Road Magician", sending the top card of his Deck (" Luminous Shaman ") to the GY to increase the ATK of "Sevens Road Magician" by 300 for each different Attribute in his GY until the End Phase ("Sevens Road Magician": 5200 → 7000 ATK). "Sevens Road Magician" attacks and destroys "Blue-Eyes White Dragon" (Hologram Man: 4000 → 0 LP).

 Changes to the dub 
 The words "Rush Duel" are removed from Yuga's red flag.
 As with all previous Yu-Gi-Oh! series, the card layout has been altered. In this case, however, while the layout has mostly been left intact, the names have been replaced with blank lines; and, to replace the cards' texts, the level stars are moved to the bottom left, and the ATK and DEF are moved to the top and bottom, respectively.
 
 Trivia 
 Like the first featured Duel of other series, the main protagonist duels against an opponent that summons a monster with 3000 ATK.
