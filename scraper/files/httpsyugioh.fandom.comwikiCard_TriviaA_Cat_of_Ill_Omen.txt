 Crossing a black cat on the street is considered bad luck in some cultures (an ill omen).
 That being said, this monster having a relation to the “ Gravekeeper's ” archetype makes historical sense. The Egyptians worshipped Cats, and they were very much considered the opposite, being believed to bring good fortune. They were valued for protecting pharaohs and killing vermin like poisonous snakes. They were mummified along with their owners, to guide them to the afterlife. Killing a cat, even if accidental, was a felony with punishment being execution. 
 This monster appears in the artwork of " Cat Meeting ". 
 This card is currently the only card in the game that can search out any  Trap Card  without any restrictions. 
 This monster is the opposite of " An Owl of Luck ":
 This card searches a Trap card, while the other a  Spell Card . 
 Both monsters are  Flip  and either topdeck or add the card to the hand, depending if " Necrovalley " is present. 
 Both monsters have inversed  ATK  and  DEF  of one another, as well as the same level. 
 One is  Beast , the other  Winged-Beast . 
 Both monsters names are the opposite; this monster refers to bad luck instead of good luck. 
 Both names are phonetically similar
