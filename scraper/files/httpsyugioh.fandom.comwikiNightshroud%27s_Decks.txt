Nightshroud  plays a variety of Decks in the anime. He begins with a  Red-Eyes  Deck , which he wields through  Atticus Rhodes . Through the power of " Red-Eyes Darkness Dragon " and  his mask , Nightshroud could possess Atticus, even midway through a Duel.
 Atticus is able to counter this by removing "Red-Eyes Darkness Dragon" and its related cards from the Deck. Nightshroud then Duels against Atticus through  Yusuke Fujiwara  using a  " Clear " Deck , reflecting his worldview.
 After Fujiwara's defeat, Nightshroud uses a  Darkness  Deck  while in his true form.

 While possessing Fujiwara, Nightshroud plays a  Clear Deck , which focuses on the use of his Field Spell " Clear World " to cripple his opponent's  monsters  while his own monsters, immune to its effects (since they have no Attribute while on the  field ), overwhelm the opposition with a combination of special effects and brute force. The Deck itself is a reflection of Nightshroud's beliefs: individuality brings suffering, while nullification relieves it.

 In his true form, Nightshroud runs a  Darkness Deck , focusing on the  Field Spell  of his namesake, " Darkness ", and a long  chain  of  Trap Cards  supported by it, as, by activating his " Zero " and then his " Infinity " cards, every other Trap activates and gives Nightshroud a variety of effects to use.  In addition, the monsters in this Deck interfere with aspects of the Duel, as well as let him ignore the negative drawbacks of his Field Spell, with his strongest being " Darkness Neosphere ", which has the ability to control nearly the entire field.
