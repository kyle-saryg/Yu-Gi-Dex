 The Wicked Dreadroot  is a character in  Yu-Gi-Oh! R . He is among the three  Wicked Gods , with its card counterpart being " The Wicked Dreadroot ".
 
 Manga history 
 Maximillion Pegasus  created 3  Duel Monsters  cards, who were known as the Wicked Gods to keep his Egyptian Gods in check, but stopped their production due to his fear of their immense power. After Pegasus passed away,  Yako Tenma  completed what Pegasus had left behind of the three Wicked Gods.
 Yako possessed his brother,  Gekko Tenma , to Duel  Yugi Mutou  to enact revenge on him. Yako used one of the copies of "The Wicked Dreadroot" against Yugi, but, ultimately, Yugi used " Spellbinding Illusion " to weaken "Dreadroot" as well as negate his effect of halving the ATK of all monsters on the field, and with " Lightning Blade ", Yugi's monster was able to destroy it. However, Yako revealed that he the point of the Duel was to be able to Summon "The Wicked Dreadroot", allowing him to detach the soul of  Anzu Mazaki  for the  R.A Project .
 When Gekko allied with Yugi, he tore up his copy of "The Wicked Dreadroot", leaving Yako with the last copy of this card.
 Yako used this card as well as " The Wicked Avatar " in his Duel against  Seto Kaiba , swiftly defeating him.
 Due to the Summoning of "The Wicked Dreadroot" and " The Wicked Avatar " during this Duel, Yako was able to revive Pegasus, though it ultimately failed thanks to Kaiba.
