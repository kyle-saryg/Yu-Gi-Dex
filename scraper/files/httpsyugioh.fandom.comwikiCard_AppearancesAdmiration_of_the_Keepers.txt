 Yu-Gi-Oh! ARC-V 
 In  episode 116 , both  Apollo  and  Diana  use this card in their duels against  Yugo  and  Kite Tenjo  respectively. They activate this card when their respective opponents each Special Summon a monster from their  Extra Decks . Those monsters' effects are negated; also, they can attack all "Keeper Shield Tokens" their opponents control, once each during the Battle Phase, otherwise the monster whose effects were negated is destroyed. Both Apollo and Diana control three such tokens after Special Summoning two of them using this card's other effect, the other being summoned by their " Luminous Keeper " and " Penumbral Keeper " respectively. For each token destroyed:
 The attacking monster loses 800 ATK. 
 Yugo takes 800 damage due to the effect of "Luminous Keeper". 
 Diana gains 800  LP  due to the effect of "Penumbral Keeper".
