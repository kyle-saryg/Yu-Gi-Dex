 The  Knights of Hanoi 's activities have begun to reach the real world itself. Sensing the impending danger,  Kolter  decides to leave behind a record about the truth behind the connection between the  Knights of Hanoi  and the  Lost Incident , as well as the  The Deleted Incident ...
 
 Summary 
 Cal Kolter writes his report, dubbed "file number 1007". He claims he may not be able to survive for long enough to make money out of publishing said report. He knows that the  Knights of Hanoi  have begun to affect the real world with their activities in the virtual world, and thus, decides to document what has happened so far. 
 Cal first recalls the  Lost Incident , in which brother  Jin  was one of the victims. However, the  recalled flashback  is that of  Yusaku Fujiki , another victim which Cal now co-operates with. Cal remembers that their lives depended on winning duel after duel at the time, because if they lost, they would starve. Jin and Yusaku were eventually freed from their ordeals, but those would still continue to torment them emotionally. Cal also claims that the discovery of the Knights of Hanoi's involvement in the Lost Incident was how Yusaku and Cal teamed up to fight them. This leads to a  flashback to the first episode . 
 Cal then recalls the Knights of Hanoi's hunt for the  Ignis , an advanced self-aware artificial intelligence. Cal and Yusaku decided to catch one of the fleeing Ignis and become bait for the Knights of Hanoi's objectives. With the captured Ignis in his duel disk, Yusaku logged on to LINK VRAINS, which was under attack by a Knight of Hanoi. As Playmaker, Yusaku threatened to delete the Ignis in front of a Knight of Hanoi, but opted to settle the matter with a duel instead. The Ignis generated a  Data Storm  to make  Playmaker's duel against the Knight of Hanoi  a  Speed Duel . During the duel, Playmaker was engulfed in the eye of the storm; the Ignis in his duel disk informed him of his Skill, Storm Access. Thus, Playmaker obtained " Decode Talker ", performed a  Link Summon , and used the newly-acquired  Link Monster 's traits to defeat the Knight of Hanoi.
 Afterwards, Cal recalls  the episode in which Yusaku's Ignis was named "Ai" . At the time, Cal hacked into the captured Ignis' data, and noticed a disturbing video of the Knights of Hanoi's attack on Ai's domain, including a shot of what appeared to be their leader. After Ai's reaction prompted Cal to turn off  Café Nom 's power systems, Yusaku went outside and saw the exact same person from the video fly over him on  his dragon . Later, Ai was prompted to give this person's identity, which he claimed was  Varis . 
 Cal then recalls  Playmaker's first Speed Duel against Varis , which ended in a tie. Therefore, Varis and Playmaker agreed to engage each other further, this time in a  Master Duel ,  which Playmaker won . Cal notes that he and Yusaku haven't seen Varis since. However, they did gain new allies, those being  The Gore  and  Blue Angel , both of which won  their   duels  against  high-ranking   members  of the Knights of Hanoi. Cal claims he never thought a Charisma duelist and a pop idol would be teaming up with them. Even then, Playmaker did the best work on his own, as shown when  he too  defeated a  top  Knight of Hanoi.  
 This leads to the conclusion of Cal's report. After he finishes writing it, he looks at the photo of his younger self and Jin. Just then, Yusaku pops in for a visit. He states that he's concerned about Varis' next move. At the Hanoi's base, Varis himself notes the imminent completion of the Tower of Hanoi.
