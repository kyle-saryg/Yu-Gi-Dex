 History 
 By manifesting through the cards of  duelists  who have felt negative emotions and assuming their form, but not before getting rid of the original. When he does this, everybody who knew the individual forgets they ever existed.
 His victims from the main cast included:  Daigo Sorano ,  Axel Brodie ,  Sartorius ,  Sarina  and  Tyranno Hassleberry .
 At  Duel Academy  while looking at a list of all the students,  Alexis ,  Chazz  and  Syrus  thought that there were more students once at the academy but that they can't remember any of the people they had Dueled that day.  Atticus , who was also present, did not remember there being anymore than those listed.
 While in  Domino City ,  Axel Brodie  discovered a list of names on a computer screen inside a van. The names on the list began to disappear one by one as Trueman captured them. Axel then dashed from the van and went to  KaibaCorp . 
 Here he found a list of people employed by  KaibaCorp . Names on that list began to disappear with  Seto Kaiba 's name being the only one to remain. Later Trueman's master,  Nightshroud , revealed that it had created an artificial solar eclipse over the planet, with its own dark world blocking out the sun, which assimilated all humans on Earth, likely including Seto Kaiba, into the  World of Darkness . 
 This left  Jaden ,  Pharaoh , and the immaterial  Lyman Banner , as the last known denizens on Earth. It can be assumed everyone in  Domino City  and the world were released from the  World of Darkness  after  Jaden  defeated Nightshroud.
