 Featured Duel: Yuya Sakaki vs. Officer 227 
       Yuya  vs.  DC227 .     
 At the start of the  Duel , the  Field Spell Card  " Crossover Acceleration " is  activated , as per the rules of an  Action Duel  and a  Turbo Duel . It will allow the players to use  Action Cards , but they may only have one in their  hand  at a time.
 Turn 1: DC227 
 DC227 's hand contains " Jutte Lord ", " Jutte Fighter ", " Goyo Arrow ", " Stygian Security " and " Synchro Gift ". DC227  Normal Summons  "Jutte Lord" (1600/1200). Since it was Normal or  Special Summoned , its  effect  activates, letting him Special Summon a " Jutte "  monster  from his hand. He Special Summons "Jutte Fighter" (700/900). DC227  tunes  the Level 4 "Jutte Lord" with the Level 2  Tuner monster  "Jutte Fighter" to  Synchro Summon  " Goyo Predator " (2400/1200) in  Attack Position . He then  equips  "Predator" with "Goyo Arrow", whose effect allows him to once per  turn  inflict  damage  to his opponent equal to the equipped monster's  Level  x 100. DC227 activates the effect now (Yuya: 4000 → 3400 LP).
 Turn 2: Yuya 
 Yuya 's hand contains " Performapal Odd-Eyes Unicorn ", " Performapal Bot-Eyes Lizard ", " Performapal Fireflux ", " Double Reborn Level 4 ", and " Mimiclay ". He  draws  " Performapal Odd-Eyes Light Phoenix ". Yuya activates "Odd-Eyes Light Phoenix" (   3) and "Odd-Eyes Unicorn" (   8) in his  Pendulum Zones . Yuya  Pendulum Summons  "Bot-Eyes" (1600/1200) and "Fireflux" (1200/1600) from his hand, both in Attack Position. "Bot-Eyes"  attacks  "Predator", with Yuya activating the effect of "Bot-Eyes", letting him change its name to that of an " Odd-Eyes " monster. He changes its name to " Odd-Eyes Dragon ". Since an "Odd-Eyes" monster under Yuya's  control   declared  an attack, the  Pendulum Effect  of "Odd-Eyes Unicorn" activates, which lets him increase the attacking monster's  ATK  by the ATK of an Attack Position " Performapal " monster he controls until the end of the  Battle Phase  ("Bot-Eyes": 1600 → 2800). The attack continues and "Bot-Eyes"  destroys  "Goyo Predator" (DC227: 4000 → 3600 LP). "Fireflux" attacks  directly  (DC227: 3600 → 2400 LP).
 Turn 3: DC227 
DC227 activates "Monster Reborn", letting him Special Summon a monster from either player's  Graveyard . He Special Summons "Goyo Predator" (2400/1200) from his Graveyard in Attack Position. "Predator" attacks and destroys "Bot-Eyes", with Yuya attempting to grab an Action Card, but being blocked by DC227, resulting in neither player getting the card (Yuya: 3400 → 2600 LP). Since it destroyed an opponent's monster  by battle  and  sent  it to the Graveyard, the effect of "Predator" activates, Special Summoning that monster to his  field , so "Bot-Eyes" (1600/1200) is Special Summoned. "Bot-Eyes" attacks and destroys "Fireflux" (Yuya: 2600 → 2200 LP).
 Turn 4: Yuya 
Yuya draws " Odd-Eyes Pendulum Dragon "  and subsequently Pendulum Summons it (2500/2000) from his hand, along with "Fireflux" (1200/1600) from his  Extra Deck , both in Attack Position. DC227 finds and activates the Action Card, " Battle Lock ", which prevents his opponent's monsters from attacking this turn.
 Turn 5: DC227 
DC227 draws " Polymerization ". He Normal Summons "Stygian Security" (100/600). DC227 tunes the Level 4 "Bot-Eyes" with the Level 1 Tuner monster "Stygian Security" to Synchro Summon " Goyo Chaser " (1900/1000) in Attack Position. He then activates "Polymerization",  fusing  "Chaser" and "Predator" to  Fusion Summon  " Goyo Emperor " (3300/2500) in Attack Position. "Emperor" attacks "Pendulum Dragon" (Yuya: 2200 → 1400 LP), but it isn't destroyed via the effect of "Emperor" and instead DC227 takes control of it and it gains this same effect. "Pendulum Dragon" attacks "Fireflux" (Yuya: 1400 → 100 LP), but because of the effect it isn't destroyed and DC227 takes control of it instead. "Fireflux" attacks directly, but Yuya activates the Pendulum Effect of "Light Phoenix" as his opponent is attacking directly, destroying the card in his other Pendulum Zone and Special Summoning itself. "Unicorn" is destroyed and "Light Phoenix" (2000/1000) is Special Summoned. A  replay  occurs and DC227 chooses not to attack.
 Turn 6: Yuya 
Yuya draws " Odd-Eyes Saber Dragon ". He activates "Double Reborn Level 4", which allows both players to Special Summon a Level 4 monster from their own Graveyard in  Defense Position . DC227 Special Summons "Jutte Lord" (1600/1200) and Yuya Special Summons "Bot-Eyes". Yuya treats "Bot-Eyes Lizard" as "Odd-Eyes Dragon" via its own effect. He then  Tributes  the  LIGHT  monster "Light Phoenix" and  sends  "Bot-Eyes" being treated as "Odd-Eyes Dragon" from his side of the  field  to the Graveyard to Special Summon "Saber Dragon" (2800/2000) from his hand in Attack Position via its own effect. "Saber Dragon" attacks and destroys "Jutte Lord". Since it destroyed a monster by battle and sent it to the Graveyard, he can destroy a monster his opponent controls. "Goyo Emperor" is destroyed and since it  left the field , control of all monsters are returned to their  owners  via its effect. "Pendulum Dragon" attacks directly. DC227 finds and activates the Action Card, " Evasion ",  negating  the attack, but Yuya also finds and activates the Action Card, " No Action ", which negates the activation of his opponent's Action  Spell Card  and destroys it. The attack continues (DC227: 2400 → 0 LP).
