 Design 
 Personality 
 The Guard Robot is very calculative, and always certain of the actions it takes against its opponent. It believes there is nothing wrong in its calculations, which ultimately was its downfall against  Yusei . Before it lost, when Yusei played " Stardust Dragon ", the Guard Robot changed its calculations from Yusei having a 100% chance of defeat, to a 100% chance of winning. [1] 
 
 Abilities 
 Having been programmed by  Primo , the Duel Robot can analyze an opponents strategies in its eyes and deal with them accordingly, and even determine the percentage that they would play a certain type of card. [2] 
 
 Biography 
 This Security robot is activated by  Primo , as a measure to prevent  Yusei Fudo  from getting his stolen engine program back. Later, it was used as a method of keeping him inside until the countdown for the explosion of the warehouse they were in reached 0. Before he left, Primo programmed the robot with data from Yusei's previous Duels, so it could counter against Yusei's Dueling strategies.
 While Yusei is questioning  Lazar  about where the program is, the robot appears before them. It then scans and identifies Yusei, and then proceeds to close down all of the exits. The security robot then claims that he must defeat it in a  Duel , if they wish to proceed.
 Yusei accepts, and as the Duels begins, he's quickly put into a tight spot, as the Guard Robot analyzes and counters every move he makes while continuously increasing the amount of counters on " Counter Force " which the Guard Robot was going to use to win the Duel. The Duel was leading in the robot's favor throughout until it caused its own demise by  paying  half its  Life Points  via " Solemn Judgment " to  negate  Yusei's " Double Cyclone " which ultimately led to its defeat as Yusei proceeded to activate " Panic Wave " to negate the effects of the Guard Robot's cards, allowing Yusei to Summon " Stardust Dragon " and defeat the robot by destroying " Lock Dragon ". It was destroyed when the robotics factory was.
