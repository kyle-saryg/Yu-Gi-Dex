 The  Extra Deck  (Japanese: エクストラデッキ  Ekusutora Dekki ; usually abbreviated  ＥＸ デッキ since  Code of the Duelist ), formerly known as the  Fusion Deck  ( 融 合 デッキ  Yūgō Dekki ), is a Deck where  Fusion ,  Synchro ,  Xyz , and  Link Monsters  (as well as  Pendulum Monsters  that would otherwise have been sent from the  field  to the  Graveyard ) are stored during a  Duel .

 Mechanics 
 The Extra Deck is separate from the  Main Deck , and contains combinations of  Fusion ,  Synchro ,  Xyz , and  Link Monsters . During the game, it is placed face-down in the  Extra Deck Zone , and a player can Special Summon Monsters included in there.
 
 Construction 
 The Extra Deck has a maximum size of  15  cards (including all Fusion, Synchro, Xyz, and Link Monsters combined). Per the " Maximum of 3 Rule ", during Deck construction there can be at most 3 cards with the same name in a player's Main Deck, Extra Deck and  Side Deck  (combined).  Usage of Extra Deck is not mandatory by rule .
 
 Gameplay 
 During a Duel, players can Special Summon Monsters from the Extra Deck through  Fusion Summon ,  Synchro Summon ,  Xyz Summon ,  Pendulum Summon ,  Link Summon , or any other cards that  Special Summons from Extra Deck . It is not necessary to  shuffle  the Extra Deck, even when a card specifies that the card would be shuffled into the Deck.
 If a Fusion Monster, Synchro Monster, Xyz Monster, or Link Monster would be  returned  to the  hand  or  Main Deck , it is instead returned to the Extra Deck (face-down), since Fusion Monsters, Synchro Monsters, Xyz Monsters, and Link Monsters cannot exist in the hand or the Main Deck.
 
 Pendulum Monsters 
 Unlike other Monster cards, Pendulum Monsters that would be sent to the Graveyard from the field are placed face-up into the Extra Deck.
 Pendulum Monsters placed face-up in the Extra Deck during a Duel can cause the total size of the Extra Deck to exceed the maximum size permitted during Deck construction.
 
 Extra Monster Zone 
 Link Monsters and Pendulum Monsters that are Special Summoned from the Extra Deck  must  be Special Summoned to an  Extra Monster Zone  or a  Main Monster Zone   pointed to  by a  Link Monster . 
 Fusion, Synchro and Xyz Monsters that are Special Summoned from Extra Deck  may  be Special Summoned to either Extra Monster Zone or Main Monster Zone .
 In case of  Fusion Pendulum ,  Synchro Pendulum  and  Xyz Pendulum Monsters , they can be Fusion/Synchro/Xyz Summoned to  any zone from face-down . But when Pendulum Summoning them  from face-up , they must be Summoned to an Extra Monster Zone or a  Main Monster Zone   pointed to  by a  Link Monster .
 When Special Summoning from the Graveyard or  banished , an Extra Deck Monster must be Summoned to a Main Monster Zone.
 
 Knowledge 
 The face-down contents of the Extra Deck are not public knowledge, so a player may not look through face-down cards in their opponent's Extra Deck.
 The face-up cards in the Extra Deck are public knowledge, so either player may look through them at any time. 
 The number of cards in the Extra Deck is  public knowledge .
 
 Anime and manga 
 Limits on the number of cards that are stored in the Extra Deck in the anime and manga are not yet determined. It is also not clear at all times of the series if the Extra Deck even exists; in many early Duels, the players seem to simply fuse monsters without ever apparently pulling the Fusion Monster card from anywhere.
 It is also not clear at all times where the Extra Deck is kept:
 
 In  Yu-Gi-Oh! GX , Fusion Monster Cards are not seen to be played from anywhere, but the Fusion Monster Card is present on the Duel Disk after it is Summoned.
 Zane Truesdale 's Fusion Deck is shown to be mixed in with his Main Deck; on one occasion, he searches his Main Deck for " Chimeratech Overdragon " when  Fusion Summoning  it. [1] 
 In  Yu-Gi-Oh! 5D's ,  Akiza Izinski  can clearly be seen to have an  Extra Deck Zone  built into her Duel Disk.  Yusei Fudo  and  Jack Atlas 's Extra Decks are stored with their  Main Decks ; both are shown adding " Stardust Dragon " to their Main Decks before a Duel. [2] [3] 
 In  Yu-Gi-Oh! ZEXAL , the Extra Deck is stored in a box on the Duelist's belt. 
 In  Yu-Gi-Oh! ARC-V , Duel Disks are specifically shown to have an Extra Deck Zone compartment.
 In  Episode 134 , there are 15 cards  face-down  behind " Odd-Eyes Pendulum Dragon " and " Performapal Coin Dragon ". This number matches the Extra Deck limit in the  TCG  and  OCG. 
 In  Yu-Gi-Oh! VRAINS , the Extra Deck is not specifically shown due to the streamlining of most  LINK VRAINS  Duel Disks. However, if the Duelist is using a "Storm Access"-like  Skill , cards can be randomly added to it from  Data Storms  and formed into actual cards in the real world.
