 Trivia 
 You Show Duel School may be named after  Yusho Sakaki , the father of Yuya Sakaki. 
 You Show Duel School is documented in the  Leo Corporation  Database as "Yusyo Duel School". [1]  "Yusyo" is a Japanese-style broad romanization for "Yūshō". 
 The curriculum is limited to Skip's knowledge of Dueling. Post- Mr. Mystery , Skip admitted he had no clue how Xyz summon worked when Zuzu asked him.
