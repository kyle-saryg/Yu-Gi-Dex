 "The Real Duelist!!" , known in Japan as  "A True Duelist!!"  is the seventh chapter of the  Yu-Gi-Oh! GX  manga . It was first printed in Japanese in the  V Jump  magazine and in English in the  Shonen Jump  magazine. Both of which were printed in  volume 1  of the Yu-Gi-Oh! GX graphic novels afterwards.
 
 Summary 
 Jaden Yuki  has just  Fusion Summoned  " Elemental Hero Terra Firma " in his Duel with  Alexis Rhodes . He declares he's used all his power in one turn, and Alexis reveals her  face-down  " Cold Fusion ", which destroys "Terra Firma" and returns its  Fusion Material Monsters , " Elemental Hero Ocean " and " Elemental Hero Woodsman " to the  field , both in  Attack Position . "Cold Fusion" also places an  Ice Counter  on each returned monster, which will prevent it from changing its  Battle position .  Seika Kohinata  watches the Duel, wondering if Jaden's defeat of  Chazz Princeton  was a fluke. Regardless, it doesn't matter, as either result of this duel will benefit her. Alexis activates the effect of her " Cold Enchanter ",  discarding  a card to place an Ice Counter on Jaden's " Elemental Hero Heat ". Jaden  Sets  a card to end his turn.
 Alexis begins her turn, activating the " Absolute Zero Barrier "  Field Spell Card , which will prohibit all monsters with Ice Counters from declaring attacks, and decrease their  ATK  by 500. Alexis switches both of her monsters to Attack Position and declares attacks, but Jaden activates his face-down " Negate Attack ",  negating  the attacks and ending the  Battle Phase . Jaden begins his turn, and is perplexed as to what to do. He believes he's  drawn  a card that will help him, but keeps in his hand, Summoning " Elemental Hero Lady Heat " in Defense Position, he ends his turn.
 Alexis discards another card to place an Ice Counter on "Lady Heat" with " Cold Enchanter ", and then  Tributes  both "Cold Enchanter" and " Cyber Valkyrie " to Summon " Ice Master ". She activates its effect, sending "Absolute Zero Barrier" to the  Graveyard  to destroy all monsters with Ice Counters. This leaves Jaden's field bare, and Alexis attacks  directly , reducing Jaden to 1300  Life Points .
 Jaden activates the card he drew last turn - " Heat Crystals ", which removes his "Heat" and "Lady Heat" in his Graveyard from play so that he can Fusion Summon " Elemental Hero Inferno " in Attack Position. Alexis reminds him that "Inferno" is weaker than "Ice Master", but Jaden reveals that "Inferno" gets a 1000-ATK when battling with  WATER - attribute  monsters. Jaden attacks, and Alexis activates her face-down " Doble Passe ", making his attack a direct attack.  Syrus Truesdale  is perplexed, while  Bastion Misawa  declares her strategy to be perfect. "Doble Passe" will let "Ice Master" wage an immediate direct attack as well. Jaden compliments her, but declares that the duel is his, while activating " Backdraft ", which deals damage to Alexis equal to the ATK of "Inferno", as it just inflicted  Battle Damage  to her, winning Jaden the Duel.
 This means that Jaden's vote will go to Seika, but Seika herself declines, stating she can't accept it after a duel like that. The whole crowd is behind Alexis, and Seika believes they wouldn't accept her as Miss Duel Academy after seeing such a duel. Jaden agrees, saying that all titles at Duel Academy should be won via dueling, not votes.
