 Design 
 Appearance 
       Linework     
 His general modus operandi and physical stature are reminiscent of  PaniK , though he also looks, sounds, and acts a lot like pro wrestler  The Undertaker  (and at one point says "rest in peace" to his first victim; this is one of the Undertaker's prominent catchphrases). He also bares a strong resemblance to the Resident Evil character Mr. X, also called Tyrant. He wears an iron mask, a hat and a large jacket, as well as a  fake Millennium Puzzle . He normally creates fog around him to appear as if a true  Shadow Game  was imminent. [1] 
 
 Personality 
 Titan remains calm most of the time and is confident in defeating his opponents, calling himself a "pro" which while he isn't weak upon introduction isn't near as skilled with 0 shadow powers. He never turns his back to his opponents and make the set of his fake  Shadow Games  appear to be real. [1]  Titan intimidates his opponents during the Duels showing his  Millennium Pendant , doing tricks to mimic a Shadow Duel and by telling the Duelists their mistakes or their lack of damage they've done. [2] 
 The dub also states that Titan used to work as a  carny , an aspect not present in the original. There is also speculation that Titan has a family in the dub, as his last words in his first appearance before being consumed by the darkness are "Tell my kids I love them!".
 
 Biography 
 History 
       Titan executing his fake  Mind Crush .     
 Titan was known as the Shadow Duelist, usually being hired to defeat  Duelists  using  Shadow Games , charging to his clients three months of their salary. Despite his reputation of possessing the power of a  Millennium Item , it is in fact a  fake Millennium Puzzle  and Titan used various tricks to mimic a Shadow Game. [1] 
 
 Yu-Gi-Oh! GX 
 Titan appeared at first defeating a Duelist in the street full of fog in a fake  Shadow Game  and showed a  fake Millennium Puzzle  to his opponent and uses a fake  Mind Crush  against him. After he falls unconscious Titan takes all his rare cards. He is then contacted by  Crowler  to take down  Jaden Yuki . Crowler and Titan met at the pier of  Duel Academy  where Titan agreed to defeat Jaden in exchange for three months of Crowler's salary. [1] 
 Titan set himself up at the  Abandoned Dorm  and kidnapped  Alexis Rhodes  when she went near the dorm to honor her missing  brother . He threw her into a coffin and left her " Etoile Cyber " card on the ground as bait. When Jaden arrived, he rushed to save her and Dueled Titan. Titan created fog and used his Millennium Pendant to make parts of Jaden's body disappear whenever he took damage. Jaden didn't believe it to be a real Shadow Game as a Millennium Item would be needed to invoke one, so Titan showed his Millennium Pendant. [1]  Jaden later discovered that the Shadow Game was fake and  destroyed  " Pandemonium ", getting rid of the fog in the process. He then threw a card at the fake Millennium Puzzle, destroying it. Jaden then asked him how many  Millennium Items  are in total, which Titan answers "seven" but makes a mistake by saying "seven Millennium *Puzzles*" instead of "*Items*". In the dub, Titan called his Millennium Item the Millennium Pendant, when it was actually the Millennium Puzzle (Note that the Millennium Pendant is the actual name, but after Atem sealed his soul inside it and shattered it, the need to reassemble the pieces made it be called the Millennium Puzzle). After being discovered Titan tries to escape but a real Shadow Duel is invoked. [2] 
 
       Comparison between a false and a real Shadow Game.     
         Titan takes Alexis back to abandoned dorm .     
 Titan became the victim of a real Shadow Duel and was possessed by a spirit from the Abandoned Dorm and is forced to continue the Duel. However he's dragged into the darkness ( Shadow Realm  in the dub) after being defeated. [2] 
 
         Titan weakens Alexis playing a real shadow game.     
 He was later saved by  Kagemaru  under the condition that he would serve as the sixth of the  Shadow Riders , Titan Accepts and was given a  Shadow Charm  mask to bind him to the real world. Taking advantage of Alexis' desire to restore her brother's memories, Titan takes her to the Abandoned Dorm where they first met and challenges her to a duel. Titan tells Alexis that she can get back her brother's lost memories if she wins, but if she loses he will claim and take her to the dark realm he can back from. Alexis seemed to have an advantage on him at first, but soon turns the duel in his favor when he activated "Dark Arena" turning the duel into a real shadow game and engulfed the field in darkness preventing her from seeing his monsters. Titan's shadow game then started to weaken Alexis both mind and body when his monsters started to inflict real physical damage to her and then began mocking her strength and determination as weak. Alexis however found the will to continue after hearing the support of her brother leading to her winning the duel. After losing, Titan's soul is pulled back into the pits of darkness. [3] 
 
 Non-canon appearances 
 In  Yu-Gi-Oh! GX Tag Force , Titan appears in the game's third part, and partners with  Dr. Crowler . He also appears during Part 1 (after you beat the Story Mode at least once) at the Harbor after 11:00 PM. He can become your partner if you ask him and beat him in a duel. Upon acquiring his  Deck Recipe  after beating him in duel 10 times, Titan also gifts the player with three copies each of  " Archfiend Matador " and " Ritual of the Matador ". 
 In  Yu-Gi-Oh! GX Tag Force 2 , Titan appears in  Alexis Rhodes ' storyline. The opponents that Alexis and the player defeat in storyline events begin to vanish after Dueling them. At the end, Jinzo is confronted at the  Abandoned Dorm . He teams with  Jinzo , as the two were attempting to gather enough souls to suit both their purposes. The students are released upon their defeat. Titan will then randomly appear on the field in your next Story Mode playthroughs and can be selected as a partner (if you beat him in Duel at least 10 times)
