 Biography 
 Osler was hired with many other  card professors  to guard the  R.A. Project  by  Yako Tenma . He guards one of the lower floors of  KaibaCorp . He planted a " Booby Trap " card in one of the upper floors. When  Katsuya Jonouchi  picks it up, a trap door opens - a literal booby trap. This separated him from  Yugi Mutou , letting  Kirk Dixon  corner him. Klamath  Dueled  Jonouchi and claimed he has stronger luck than him. Though he consistently got good  draws , he lost to Jonouchi's " Roulette Spider ". He seems to be good friend with Dixon, as a picture of the two operating remote-controlled toys, based on the monsters that they use is shown. [1]
