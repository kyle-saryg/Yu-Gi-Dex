 The Path of victory is in the cards, Search for duelists by touching the map they are ready to face your challenge, Summon powerful 3D monsters from over 1000 cards including some of the latest cards, Duel and Trade cards wirelessly with your friends. 
 Unlike the previous Yu-Gi-Oh! Gameboy Advance games, it contains:
 
 Utilization of the DS's touch screen to make faster and easier decisions, while still able to use the buttons. 
 The top screen shows a 3-D game board view of the duel including battle between monsters and animations of each  Monster Card  when they're on the field. 
 While in the Overworld, the bottom screen shows a map to freely navigate to different areas and find duelists. 
 Gameplay 
 You role play as a novice duelist participating in the  Battle City  Tournament featuring the original Yu-Gi-Oh! cast. The original Battle City storyline has been altered some to extend game play and include duelists such as  Maximillion Pegasus  and the  Paradox Brothers .  The  Virtual World  story arc is also included.

 Trivia 
 Due to a glitch, after defeating  Odion Ishtar  for the first time,  Pegasus  no longer appears as an opponent. This makes it impossible for the player to trade for his cards (he is the only Duelist with " Imperial Order ") and get his Deck Recipe afterward, so players who wish to fully complete the game must do both of the above before defeating Odion usually. 
 Shortly after the start of the game's storyline,  Shadow Games  are introduced. When traveling between locations at night, the player can be intercepted by evil duelists such as  Rare Hunters  and be forced to Duel them. Losing or even tying with them will result in being sent to the  Shadow Realm , giving the player a Game Over and requiring them to restart from their previous save point. Only exception is Joey controlled Marik which if you win Joey will die as in the anime. 
 The Japanese version of this game uses the censored  TCG  card artworks instead of the Japanese. 
 Tristan Taylor  and  Duke Devlin  do not appear in this game even though Yugi Muto, Joey Wheeler, Serenity Wheeler, and Tea Gardner do.
