 Yusei  and  Crow  have worked hard to prepare their  Duel Runners  for the  World Racing Grand Prix . However,  Jack  hasn't worked at all, and Crow tells him to learn to be serious. But Jack apparently has another problem he must solve first.  Carly  learns of a loaner named  Don Piero , who rips off people. Jack also learns about what he does to people and therefore challenges him to a  Duel , betting his " Red Dragon Archfiend " and  Phoenix Whirlwind  in the process.

 Featured Duel 
 Jack Atlas vs. Don Piero 
 Turn 1: Piero 
Piero  draws  " Upstart Goblin " and subsequently  activates  it to draw one card ("Endless Loan") and increase  Jack 's Life Points by 1000 (Jack 4000 → 5000). Piero then  Special Summons  " Nefarious Trader " ( 1/0/0) from his hand in Attack Position via its own effect as Jack's Life Points are higher than his. He then  Normal Summons  " Toichi the Nefarious Debt Collector " ( 3/800/1300) in  Defense Position  and sets a card.
 Turn 2: Jack 
 Jack   draws . He then  Normal Summons  " Power Invader " ( 5/2200/0) in Attack Position without Tributing via its own effect as Piero controls at least two monsters.  Piero  then  activates  his face-down " Endless Loan " to  Special Summon  a " Loan Token " ( 1/0/0) to Jack's side of the  field  in Defense Position as Jack summoned a monster. Don Piero states that since a Loan Token is on the field, "Toichi the Nefarious Debt Collector" can't be destroyed in battle, however Jack can send one card from his hand to the Graveyard to destroy the Loan Token.
 "Power Invader"  attacks  and destroys "Nefarious Trader" (Piero 4000 → 1800). The effect of "Nefarious Trader" activates, allowing Piero to  Special Summon  another "Loan Token" ( 1/0/0) to Jack's side of the field in Defense Position. Jack can destroy this token by sending a card from his hand to the Graveyard. Jack sets two cards ("Compulsory Recoil Device" and "Zero Hole").
 Turn 3: Piero 
 Piero   draws  " Illegal Business Practices " and subsequently activates it,  equipping  it to "Toichi the Nefarious Debt Collector". Now once per turn, Piero can double the effect damage that Jack takes from the effect of "Toichi the Nefarious Debt Collector". Piero activates the  effect  of "Toichi the Nefarious Debt Collector" to inflict  damage  to Jack equal to the number of "Loan Tokens" Jack controls times 1000. There are currently two and "Illegal Business Practices" doubles the  effect damage  Jack takes (Jack 5000 → 1000).
 Turn 4: Jack 
 Jack   draws  "Smile Kid". Jack then  discards  one card from his  hand  in order to  Special Summon  " Smile Kid " ( 1/0/0) in Attack Position. The effect of "Endless Loan" activates,  Special Summoning  a third "Loan Token" ( 1/0/0) to Jack's side of the  field  in Defense Position. 
 Jack then activates his face-down " Compulsory Recoil Device " and activates its effect to send one card in his hand to the Graveyard and  return  "Smile Kid" to his  hand . Jack then discards one card from his hand in order to Special Summon "Smile Kid" ( 1/0/0) in Attack Position (The effect of "Endless Loan" doesn't activate at this point as Jack's  Monster Card Zones  are all occupied).
 Jack then activates his face-down " Zero Hole " to  destroy  all cards on the field as he has no cards in his  hand . Jack then activates the effect of " Smile Kid " in order to  Special Summon  " Smile Angel " ( 4/1800/300) in Attack Position. "Smile Angel" then  attacks   directly  (Piero 1800 → 0).
 
 Tenth Anniversary Tribute 
 The first fifteen seconds of this episode features  Jaden  and his most famous cards ( Elemental Hero Neos ,  Elemental Hero Bubbleman ,  Elemental Hero Wildheart ,  Winged Kuriboh ,  Elemental Hero Burstinatrix ,  Elemental Hero Avian ,  Elemental Hero Flame Wingman ,  Elemental Hero Clayman ,  Elemental Hero Sparkman ,  Elemental Hero Thunder Giant  and  Card Ejector ).
 
 Differences in adaptations 
 In the English dub,  Don Piero  is said to be a mob boss, when in the original, he was just a loan shark. 
 The scenes where  Jack  tries and is fired from several jobs receive some alterations in the English dub. For example, the restaurant that fired him was changed to just a pizza restaurant instead of a regular lunch service and when working at a store, he is fired for mistaking the deliveryman bringing a stock of magazines for his Chinese take-out deliveryman (In the original he complained to the man that his magazines didn't feature him in them). The dub also cuts out a scene of Jack rolling up his sleeve to show his  Mark of the Dragon  to the Dry Cleaner customer who had a hole in his shirt, which replaces with Jack getting rid of a stain. 
 In the original,  Stephanie  still has a crush on Jack after he gets fired from working at the cafe with her. In the English dub, she says  Carly  can "have him." 
 The scene at the beginning where one of Don Piero's goons hits a child to the floor in the original is cut out in the English dub. 
 In the last scene where Jack gets fired from Cafe la Green, Crow stated in the dub he better pick up a double shift tonight. In the original, he stated Jack hasn't changed much, having believed Jack changed a lot in a previous scene. 
 Mistakes 
 In the dub, when  Don Piero   Special Summons  " Nefarious Trader ", he stated that the  Special Summon  was possible because  Jack  had more  Attack Points  than him, when it should have been  Life Points . 
 Quotes 
 Marco : "Please duel statue, I don't have any money, but still I beg of you take my deck and let us be free from  Piero " 
 Carly : " Piero ?!" 
 Jack : "What's a  Piero ?"
