  "Tragoedia" pre-PSCT  Shonen Jump Vol. 7, Issue 9  print.   "Tragoedia" PSCT  Battle Pack: Epic Dawn  reprint. 1/2 
 Problem-Solving Card Text  (often abbreviated  PSCT ) is a method of writing  card text  used for prints released from July 8, 2011 onward. The purpose of Problem-Solving Card Text is to specify card effects to the point that most situations can be resolved by logically interpreting the card text. [1] 
 It was announced by  Kevin Tewart  through a series of blog posts to  Konami 's  Yu-Gi-Oh! 5D's   TCG  Strategy Site. [1] [2]  It was introduced to  Booster Packs  with the release of  Generation Force [3]  and  Starter Decks  with the release of  Starter Deck: Dawn of the Xyz . Reissues of older products, such as  Duelist Pack: Kaiba  from the  Silver Dragon Value Box , often use Problem-Solving Card Text.
 Legendary Collection 2: The Duel Academy Years Mega Pack  was in part created to reprint many old cards with the new text style (including the " HERO " monsters). [4]

 Interpretation 
 Problem-Solving Card Text uses specific words with very particular meanings in the context of gameplay. How to interpret the text is important to understanding how to apply card text to the game.
 This interpretation can only be applied for cards that use Problem-Solving Card Text. Cards that were printed with earlier text may use some of the same terms or structures, but this does not necessarily mean that they work as if they were Problem-Solving Card Text.
 
 Text structure 
 All card effects that make a  Chain Link  include a colon "  :  " or a semicolon "  ;  " somewhere in their text (possibly both). If a card effect does not use either, it does not make a Chain Link. [5] 
 The activation of a  Spell  or  Trap Card  always makes a Chain Link, but its effect that  resolves  with the card itself (if any) does not necessarily use a colon or semicolon. [5]  This effect is usually the first effect listed in the card's text. 
 Text before the  colon  "  :  " describes  activation conditions  (limits on  when  or  how often  a card or effect can be activated). [6] [5]  These conditions only need to be met when the card is activated. [7] 
 Conditions other than target requirements that have to be met during both activation and resolution are specifically noted in a separate sentence after the effect sentence (e.g. " Zombie Master ", " Treeborn Frog "). [7] 
 Text before the  semicolon  "  ;  " (but after the colon, if any) describes anything that happens when that card or effect is activated (such as  costs  and  targeting ). [6] [5] 
 Built-In  Special Summons  (other than  Synchro ,  Xyz ,  Pendulum , or  Link ) are denoted by  parentheses  "  ()  " stating the location from which the monster can be Special Summoned. [8] 
 Cards with bulleted effects (●) that resolve in the same  Chain Link  specify whether they resolve simultaneously or sequentially (if sequentially, effects are applied in the order they are listed). In these cases, each effect activated resolves independent of the success of the other(s).
 The text "in sequence" indicates that the bulleted effects are applied sequentially (e.g. " Gravekeeper's Oracle ", " Advance Zone "). 
 The text "(simultaneously)" indicates that the bulleted effects are applied simultaneously (e.g. " Ryko, Lightsworn Hunter ", " Kunai with Chain "). 
 If neither is specified, the effects each make separate Chain Links (e.g. " Metaphys Horus "). 
 Terminology and phrasing 
 The terms "that target" or "those targets"  and  "it" or "they/them" have specific meanings in the resolution of the effect. [7] 
 "That target" and "those targets" indicate that targets must still meet the target requirements at resolution to be affected. "Both (those) targets" and "all three targets" indicate that all targets must still meet the target requirements at resolution for any of them to be affected. 
 "It" and "they/them" indicate that the targets do not need to meet the target requirements at resolution, only when targeted. 
 Cards and effects that state "You can only  activate  this card/effect once per turn/Duel" can be  activated  again in the same  turn / Duel  if the activation is  negated .
 For example:  " Silver's Cry ", which can only be activated once per turn, and " The Seal of Orichalcos ", which can only be activated once per Duel, can be activated again during the same turn or Duel if another copy had its  activation  negated by a card such as " Magic Jammer ", but not if these card are negated by the effect of " Number 38: Hope Harbinger Dragon Titanic Galaxy " that doesn't negate a card's activation but only its effects before removing it from the field. 
 Cards and effects that state "You can only  use  this card/effect once per turn/Duel" cannot be activated again in the same turn/Duel, even if their activation is negated. [9] 
 For example:  " Souleating Oviraptor " can only use each of its effects once per  turn , while " Dotscaper " can only use each of its effects once per Duel, even if these monsters' effects are negated by a card such as " Solemn Strike ". 
 For prints released from July 2017 onward,  Quick Effects  of  Monster Cards  specifically say "Quick Effect" in their text before the colon.
 For prints released prior to July 2017, Quick Effects are marked by either the text "during either player's […]" in its  activation conditions  or the text "(this is a Quick Effect)" at the end of the effect text. (Despite being printed before July 2017,  Maximum Crisis Special Edition  uses "(Quick Effect)" to mark them.) 
 If an effect that Summon states "Immediately after this effect resolves", the Summon of that monster(s) can be negated if the effect resolves as  Chain Link  1 (e.g. " Ultimate Offering ", " Advanced Heraldry Art ").

 The conjunctives " and ", " and if you do ", " also ", " also, after that " and " then " have specific meanings. [10] 
 
 In " Do A , then  do B ", B happens after A. These things happen in sequence, not simultaneously. A is required for B, but NOT vice-versa: if A does not happen, then stop; even if B cannot happen, you still do A. [10] 
 In " Do A  and  B ", both A and B happen simultaneously. BOTH A and B are required. If you cannot do both, you do nothing. [10] 
 In " Do A , and if you do,  do B ", both A and B happen simultaneously. A is required for B, but NOT vice-versa: if A does not happen, then stop; even if B cannot happen, you still do A. [10] 
 In " Do A , also  do B ", both A and B happen simultaneously. Neither is required for the other to occur. [10] 
 In " Do A , also, after that,  do B ", B happens after A. These things happen in sequence, not simultaneously. Neither is required for the other to occur. 
 For prints released prior to May 2012, while "and" does indicate simultaneity, it gives no indication of dependency. However, "then" indicates both sequentiality and dependency for all prints with Problem-Solving Card Text. [7]

 Text structure 
 The phrase "in the  GY " (previously "in the Graveyard") indicates that the properties of the card must be checked in the GY (e.g. " Armory Arm "). As such, if the card is not in the GY at that time, there is no longer a reference point and the effect disappears. 
 Cards that can be activated in response to the activation of either a card or a card effect include "when a card or effect is activated" in their timing (e.g. " Stardust Dragon "). 
 Effects that prevent monsters from being attacked but cannot prevent the opponent from  attacking directly  specifically note this (e.g. " The Legendary Fisherman "). However, not all cards that prevent monsters from being attacked allow the opponent to attack directly (e.g. " Command Knight "). 
 Effects that prevent Summoning but still allow  Setting  note this (e.g. " Stray Lambs "). 
 Flip monsters  which have effects other than a  Flip effect  have a line break between the end of the Flip Effect and the start of the other effect(s) (e.g. " Night Assailant "). 
 There is now usually a line break before bullet points (e.g. " Wind-Up Shark ").
