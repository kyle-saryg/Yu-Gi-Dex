 If this card is the only card in your hand and your field is empty, Summon " Elemental HERO Bubbleman " to draw 2 cards. 
 Use " Spell Economics " to avoid paying Life Points. 
 If you activate this card on turn one, activate " Generation Next " to summon another " Elemental HERO " monster (or " Neo-Spacian "). The Life Point difference would be high enough to search most targets. Note that you cannot activate the effect of the monster summoned by "Generation Next".
 Using this combo can set up a turn-one " Neos "  Contact Fusion  that requires two material, particularly " Elemental HERO Air Neos ", which would gain 4000 ATK. 
 Use this card to search " Elemental HERO Blazeman " whose effect, when summoned, will allow you to add " Polymerization " to your hand, setting up your  Fusion Summon . 
 Summon " Elemental HERO Shadow Mist " with this card and you can use its effect to add a " Change " card to your hand, which can automatically set up the summon of " Masked HERO Anki " or " Masked HERO Dark Law ". 
 You can use this card late in the game to Summon an " Elemental HERO " monster and Xyz Summon " Number 39: Utopia ". Then Summon " Number C39: Utopia Ray " and since you might have 1000 LP or less, you can use its effect.
