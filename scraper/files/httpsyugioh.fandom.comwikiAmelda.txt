 Alister , known as  Amelda  in the Japanese version, is one of the main antagonists in the  Waking the Dragons  story arc of the  Yu-Gi-Oh! second series anime  along with  Valon ,  Rafael ,  Dartz  and the  Great Leviathan . After all of Paradius was free from the Great Leviathan, they redeemed themselves. 
 Alister often quarrels with  Valon  because of each one's personal reasons to go after each one's target (in the dub, they argued over whose target was stronger). Alister also bought over half of  Seto Kaiba 's  company  but it's unclear whether he used  Maximillion Pegasus 's money or money from the  Paradius  corporation.

 Design 
 Appearance 
       Alister's design incorporates multiple layers of clothing and a wide range of expressions. Depicted here is the  Duelist  in "Doma Swordsman" regalia from front, rear and alongside views and alongside views of his head from different angles.     
 Alister's usual outfit consists of a large open full-body coat with padded shoulders and belted sleeves, a cropped top (that reveals his midriff) and fingerless gloves with studded knuckles. His  Orichalcos Stone  is worn on a piece of lace around his neck. He carries a  Chaos Duel Disk .
 
 Voice and mannerisms 
 In the dub, he has a habit of making fun of the lesser members of Doma by calling them names. He called  Gurimo  "geezer" and "old man",  Rex Raptor  and  Weevil Underwood  "twerps" and "nimrods" and  Mai Valentine  "Little Miss Loudmouth". 
 Alister believes in the "sins of the father", scapegoating Seto Kaiba for the actions of his stepfather Gozaburo Kaiba, even though Seto wasn't in control of KaibaCorp when it was a weapons development company and had since altered the company to solely make games.
 
 Etymology 
 His dub name was based on  Aleister Crowley , the British occultist who created the Unicursal Hexagram, the symbol used for " The Seal of Orichalcos ". The obscurity of this fact is most likely why it wasn't changed in the dub.
 
 Biography 
 Waking the Dragons 
       Alister saving  his brother  after their home was attacked by a tank missile.     
 When Alister was a child, the country he lived in was torn apart by war. In the dub,  KaibaCorp  bought the land from the city. When the residents refused to leave,  Gozaburo Kaiba  decided to force them out. Many were forced to dig tunnels and steal food to survive. 
 
         A photograph of their mother Alister kept in his locket.     
 Alister and his brother managed to survive. In the original, there was a war going on between two countries and Gozaburo Kaiba supplied the weapons to both sides. In the English dub, Alister's mother (seen only briefly during the 150th episode inside his locket) and his brother,  Mikey , were eventually captured. 
 
         His brother was killed when the tank he was in blew up (this scene was removed from the dub).     
 In the Japanese version, his brother was killed when the tank he was in blew up. Alister has hated  Seto Kaiba  ever since and has designated him as his target.  Dartz  found him and offered him the chance to join his organization. 
 Unknown to Alister, Dartz had disguised himself as Gozaburo Kaiba and was responsible for the attack. One of Alister's treasured keepsakes is his brother's broken action figure,  Dyna Dude , from the  monster  " Air Fortress Ziggurat " (for this monster, Dyna Dude is a robot token).
 
         Alister holding his brother's burned Dyna Dude.     
 Alister is involved in two Duels, both of which are against Seto Kaiba. In the first one, Alister disguises himself as  Maximillion Pegasus  and challenges Kaiba. Halfway through the Duel, Alister pulls off his disguise and reveals his true identity and motivation after Kaiba deduces that he's not the real Pegasus. 
 The Duel ends in a  DRAW . In the second Duel, Alister disguises himself as a pilot and takes off with Kaiba on board. Halfway through the flight, Alister puts the plane on autopilot and challenges Kaiba again. When Kaiba gained the upper hand, Alister decided not to end his turn so the plane crash would kill him, Kaiba and Mokuba (in the dub, the seal would absorb all three of them if the plane crashed). In the end, Alister fails due to Kaiba using " Fang of Critias " to win the Duel and the Legendary Dragons saving the plane. As the seal takes his soul, Alister sees Mokuba as his brother and gives him his brother's  Dyna Dude  action figure before collapsing. Shortly later, Dartz took over KaibaCorp. Alister was released once Dartz and the Great Leviathan were defeated.
 
 Grand Championship 
         Alister after the Waking Dragon arc     
 He has another appearance at the end of the  Grand Championship  arc in the background by the  Leaning Tower of Pisa  during the celebrations of  Yugi Muto 's victory over  Leon von Schroeder .
 
 Dawn of the Duel 
 He appears at the end of the  Dawn of the Duel  arc during Pegasus' monologue, most likely searching for survivors from his town (or in the dub, his family).

 Deck 
 Alister utilizes two  Decks  during the series. The first is a  " Toon " Deck , used while he was masquerading as  Maximillion Pegasus  when  Seto Kaiba  came to confront him and is Pegasus' own Deck. The Deck focuses on the  Toon Monsters , which are immune to destruction  in battle  and can  attack   directly .
 After Kaiba  destroys  " Toon World " with " A Wingbeat of Giant Dragon ", Alister reveals himself, he is also seemingly revealed to have modified Pegasus' Deck, having an alternate tactic that focuses on " Gorlag ", who  Special Summons  any monster it destroys to Alister's field as a  FIRE   Attribute  monster, raising its ATK for each FIRE monster on the  field . Alister further supports "Gorlag" with " Aetonyx Flame " and " Fire Whip ".

 When Alister next encounters Kaiba, he uses an  Army Deck  of  Machine - Type  monsters that reflect the incident that happened in Alister's past where  KaibaCorp -financed troops destroyed his village and kidnapped  his brother  (in the Japanese dub, Mikey was killed instead). Alister's ace monster in this Deck is " Air Fortress Ziggurat ", his most powerful monster with 2500  ATK  and that spawns a " Robot Token " every turn, reminiscent of his brother's favorite toy.
