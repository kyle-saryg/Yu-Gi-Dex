 Summary 
 Jaden Yuki  and  Syrus Truesdale  are shown  Dueling  at the main arena in  Duel Academy . Jaden uses " Elemental Hero Tempest " to defeat Syrus. However, it's shown to be a dream, and Syrus wakes up in a dark cave by himself. Syrus hears someone yelling for help outside, and goes to assist them. It ends up being  Ojama Yellow , who is in a river being carried downstream by a violent current. Syrus saves him and the two exchange information. Syrus ultimately leaves Ojama Yellow behind after he mentions Jaden, stating that he doesn't want to be with anyone right now.
 Wanting to forget about Jaden entirely, Syrus throws his  Duel Disk  away, believing that he'll always remember Jaden if remembers Dueling. Syrus then encounters  Doom Dozer , who is chasing Ojama Yellow, intent on making him its next meal. Syrus attempts to leave, remembering he had vowed not to care for anyone else, but can't bring himself to do it. Despite not having a Duel Disk, he runs at Doom Dozer and distracts him long enough for Ojama Yellow to escape. This almost results in his own death, but he is saved by  Zane Truesdale , who summons " Cyber End Dragon " and destroys Doom Dozer. However, the blast also knocks out Syrus.
 Zane recovers Syrus' Duel Disk and departs once Syrus awakens, but thanks him for the concern he had shown towards and for trying to  save him from himself . Zane meets back up with  Aster Phoenix , as the two had been traveling together since they ended up in the same area of the dimension when they entered. He thinks he has little time left, and something important he still needs to do. Syrus finally makes his decision - he decides he needs to watch over Jaden, regardless of the latter's actions, he can't deny their friendship.
