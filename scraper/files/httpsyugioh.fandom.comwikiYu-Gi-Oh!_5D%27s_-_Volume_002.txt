 In New Domino City, the hottest game in town is the Turbo Duel, fought from blazingly fast motorcycles called Duel Runners. On the outskirts of New Domino City, in a district known as Satellite, a new Turbo Duel hero emerges—Yusei Fudo! On his custom-built Duel Runner, Yusei takes on all challengers, fighting for his friends and the future of Satellite! [2] 
 The D1 Grand Prix Begins!! 
 Yusei enters the D1 Grand Prix, hoping for a chance to duel Jack Atlas. There are new rivals and new duels to fight and the competition will be fierce. Can Yusei battle his way to the top, or is he destined to crash and burn? [3] 
 
 Story 
 New Domino City, in the year 20XX, Turbo Duels, fought from the seats of motorcycled-shaped duel disks called "Duel Runners," are the hottest game in town. 
 After Sect is knock unconscious, Yusei duels the Skeleton Knight to save his friend. Then while taking Sect to the hospital, Jack Atlas suddenly attacked and forced Yusei in a duel. Yusei crashed out and lost, and swore to duel Jack again. Now Yusei has entered the D1 Grand Prix, the battle to determine the toughest Duelist in the world!! [3] 
 
 In the Next Volume… 
 Sect gets into a Duel with Jack Atlas, and though he may have the drive he doesn't yet have the talent. Calling upon the dark powers to aid him in his duel, Sect may have to sacrifice  more than he realizes in order to win!
