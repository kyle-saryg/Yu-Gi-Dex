 Biography 
 Unleashed towards the end of the preliminary rounds of the  World Racing Grand Prix , this army was an attempt by Primo to complete the  Grand Design  through brute force. The plan was to switch the Duel Lanes to  Battle Royal  mode and force  Turbo Duelists  to fight multiple Duelbots at the same time. Although  Jakob  opposed the plan, he let it proceed. In the end,  Yusei Fudo ,  Jack Atlas ,  Bruno ,  Kaz , and likely several other Turbo Duelists were able to overtake the Diablo and begin to take back the Duel lanes. Sensing this, Primo sent all of the Diablo to take out Yusei Fudo,  Sherry LeBlanc  and  Elsworth . They almost succeeded but were destroyed by  Bruno  in the guise of  Vizor . Then, as Bruno began to  Accel Synchro Summon  in his Duel with Primo, a small pod of Diablo were able to distract him before he could Summon his ace monster. As Yusei began to Duel Primo, Bruno, Jack and Kaz managed to hunt down and finish off as many of the Diablo as they could. It is unknown if any remain, but it was shown that  Sector Security  were picking up the Duelbots up after they were defeated in order to reprogram them to do what they were originally built for.
