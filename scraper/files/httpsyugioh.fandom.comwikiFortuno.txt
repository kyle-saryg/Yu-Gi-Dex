 Abilities 
       Fortuno fortunetelling.     
 As a fortuneteller, Fortuno claims to be able to foretell the upcoming future. Before he met the  Super Secret Number Card Investigation Club , he used a set of cards to foretell that future event; he revealed " Stray Lambs " and " Reaper of the Cards ". Fortuno, representing the "Reaper of the Cards", kidnaps the Super Secret Number Card Investigation Club, or "Stray Lambs". As shown in his Duel against  Yuma Tsukumo , he even uses this ability when he Duels. However, it was revealed by  Cathy  that his ability to see Yuma's cards is a scam when Yuma realized that  Kite  doesn't have any followers and Cathy revealed that the Kite that was watching the Duel was a statue and there was a camera in the statue's right eye, feeding the info into Fortuno's  Duel Gazer .
 
       Fortuno's  Energy ball .     
 Fortuno also is able to perform an  Energy ball  with a purple coloration. He can take "Numbers" from their  holders , like Kite, using  Photon Hand , which he obtained though unknown means.
 Fortuno can also hypnotize people and take control of their wills, as he made  Tori  reveal to him that Yuma owned "Numbers". He also possessed Cathy so he could reveal himself to Yuma. These abilities are strongly hinted to have been granted to him by " Number 11: Big Eye ".
 
 Biography 
 Yu-Gi-Oh! ZEXAL 
       Fortuno hypnotizing  Tori .     
 He Dueled a  "Number" holder  who carried " Number 16: Shock Master " and won, taking his " Number " monster and leaving him shriveled and motionless like  Kite 's victims, due to his ability to use the  Photon Hand . Later, Fortuno kidnaps  Tori  and the rest of the  Super Secret Number Card Investigation Club , except  Cathy , who ran away, in order to entice  Yuma Tsukumo  into Dueling him so that he could obtain his "Numbers" for Kite. [2] 
 
         Fortuno duels  Yuma .     
After Fortuno lost to Yuma and his new " Number C39: Utopia Ray ", he was shown to possess a third "Number"  monster , which he kept hidden. However, at that moment, Kite arrives.          Fortuno meets the real  Kite .     Feeling grateful to be graced with his presence, Fortuno offered his services to Kite, but Kite's intention was just to take away his last "Number" monster, resulting in his defeat. It was also shown that he never actually worked for Kite; he just worships him. He offers himself to be Kite's servant, but Kite took his soul regardless. [3] 
 Deck 
 Fortuno plays a  " Shaman " Deck  which focuses on  swarming  the  field  in order to quickly  Xyz Summon  his " Numbers ". In addition, he uses "Dance" Spell and Trap Cards to lock down his opponent's options.
