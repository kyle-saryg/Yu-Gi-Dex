 This card's own ATK/DEF on the field become 700/100 unless its effect is negated (and no other ATK/DEF boosts from other effects apply). 
 The effects of copies stack. If three "Al-Lumi'raj" are on the field, monsters lose 900 ATK/DEF times their own Level/Rank, enough to reduce the majority of non-Link monsters to 0 ATK/DEF.
 Monsters that are  unaffected by Monster Cards  (unless they specify  activated  effects) also do not lose ATK/DEF from this card. 
 Combine this card with " Burden of the Mighty " to weaken any monsters with Levels further. 
 This card is very deadly when paired with " King Tiger Wanghu ", as it will destroy most, if not all, monsters weakened by this card. 
 This card can be combined with " Number 103: Ragnazero ", " Number 33: Chronomaly Machu Mech " or " Naturia Fruitfly ".
