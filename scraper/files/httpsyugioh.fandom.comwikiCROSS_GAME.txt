 Lyrics (TV Size) 
 Rōmaji English 
 
 Hikari sasu hou e miagete chikatta 
Bokura dake no mirai kizuiteiku 
Yoakesura tooku mabushiku sasaru 
Mezamete yuku IN ZA WANDAARANDO 
Afure dashiteita omoi no nami wa yose 
ARUGORIZUMU tokenai sekai ni 
Tatoe hikari ushinattemo 
Kokoro no ura no sunadokei wo modoranai 
Sai wo tokihanate GETTO AUTO & FOROO ZA RAITO 
Mai agare ashita e kodou yori hayaku 
Douka owaru koto naki tabi wo 
Imi wo nasanai namida wa nai kara 
Kono koe yo kimi ni todoke
 
 
 
 What we swore as we admired where the light shines upon 
is the future we will build upon that’s ours and ours alone 
Where even the light of dawn pierces far and bright, 
in the wonderland that’s awakening 
A wave of emotion that flooded in are drawing near 
and in a world unsolvable with algorithms 
should you ever lose the light 
the hourglass behind your heart will never reset 
So, let the dice fly, get out and follow the light! 
May you soar into tomorrow, faster than your heart can beat, 
through your journey with no end in sight 
There are no meaningless tears here 
so, let this reach you, voice out there.
