      The Feather of Ma'at.     
 The  Feather of Ma'at  ( 真実 の 羽 根 [1]  or  真理 の 羽 [2] [Note 1]   Maato no Hane ) is an item used in the  Weighing of the Heart  ritual. It is placed on one of the dishes of the  Millennium Scale  and weighed against the sins of a person.
 In the  Yu-Gi-Oh! GX  manga ,  Tragoedia  calls  Chazz Princeton 's " Light and Darkness Dragon " by this name, as the feather was taken in by " Winged Kuriboh " to prevent Tragoedia from reclaiming his heart, and later transferred to the "Light and Darkness Dragon" card by "Winged Kuriboh".
 It was used by  Akhenaden  and other two  High Priests  to perform  Tragoedia's weighing  and by  Shadi  to perform  Kanekura 's.
