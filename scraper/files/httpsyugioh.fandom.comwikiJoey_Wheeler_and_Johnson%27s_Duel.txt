 Prior Events 
 Joey Wheeler  searches a mansion to try and find a way out, while  Yugi Muto  and  Téa Gardner  search for the others in the frozen region. Joey kicks down a wall and finds a door, which seems to lead back to the hanger where the KaibaCorp blimp is. Once inside the blimp, Joey comes across the unconscious body of  Mai Valentine , which seems to wake up. Joey is happy to see "Mai" awake until she speaks with a male voice. Joey realizes this is a trick and the imposter sheds his disguise, revealing himself to be  Johnson , KaibaCorp's former legal adviser and an expert lawyer for  The Big Five . He proposes that he and Joey duel and if Joey loses the latter's body will belong to the former. As Joey accepts, Johnson changes the setting to one befitting him, a courtroom. Johnson then transforms into his deck master, " Judge Man ". Duelists are to select cards from the Virtual Card Database, and Joey sticks with what he knows. Joey selects  Flame Swordsman  as his deck master.
