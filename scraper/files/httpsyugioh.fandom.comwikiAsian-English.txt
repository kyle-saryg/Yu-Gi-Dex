Asian-English  cards are cards printed in English for distribution in  Asia  outside of  Japan  and  Korea . They are distinguished from  English  cards printed for English regions mainly by the  Yu-Gi-Oh!  logo on the  cards' backings  and set packaging, and the region identifier "AE" in their  set number , though prior to  Invasion of Chaos  Asian-English cards did not use the region identifier and had the same set numbers as their  North American English  versions. These cards are only  legal  in Asia outside of Japan and Korea; they are  not legal  anywhere else.

 Modern Asian-English cards were preceded by two cards (prints of " Blue-Eyes White Dragon " and " Dark Magician ") which used translated Japanese names and lores instead of the English  TCG  names and lores, printed in a fullwidth font. The modern cards are much more similar to their North American English versions, only differing by the aforementioned logo and (starting with  Invasion of Chaos ) their set numbers; in addition, all Asian-English cards are printed on the same card stock as  Japanese  cards, making them stiffer than their  TCG  counterparts.
 Aside from the early "Blue-Eyes White Dragon" and "Dark Magician" prints, Asian-English prints have normally been of  Booster Packs , with identical contents to the North American English release of the pack. All Booster Packs up to  Enemy of Justice ,  Crimson Crisis ,  Raging Battle , and the  Starter Decks   Yugi  and  Kaiba  and  Structure Deck: Lord of the Magician , had Asian-English prints. The  Duel Monsters International: Worldwide Edition  promotional cards  were only released in Asian-English, and the Japanese World Championship Qualifier participation cards and World Championship prize cards have normally included an Asian-English card.
