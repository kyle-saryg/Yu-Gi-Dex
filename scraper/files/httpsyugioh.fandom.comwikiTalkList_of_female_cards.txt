 Laval Forest Sprite 
 " Laval Forest Sprite " is a female Tuner. But I can't add it because of the table format, which I don't understand....why we need such a detailed table for this list anyway? 202.133.0.218  ( talk ) 09:54, March 21, 2011 (UTC)
 
 She's already on the list, in the Tuner Monsters section. She should also be listed in the Effect Monsters section, though you would currently have to click "… further results" at the bottom of that section's list to see that (maybe we should up the limits on how many cards get listed?). The TCG/OCG sections all make use of  Semantic MediaWiki  to automatically list cards of that type that have been marked as "Female"; to add a card to one of them, you would edit the card's page and add the text "|misc1 = Female" (if you don't trust yourself to make such an edit, whatever the reason, you can leave a note here with a link to the card you're wanting to add, and someone will wort it out for you). As for why the list goes into such detail... Most of the sections were here before I had anything to do with the list, though I did add the sections for Toon, Spirit, Union, and Tuner monsters late last night (early this morning?).  「 ダイノ ガイ 千？！ 」 ?  ·  ☎ Dinoguy1000  15:31, March 21, 2011 (UTC)

 Airknight Parshath ? 
 This looks vaguely female to me, but  File:AirknightParshath-WC08.jpg  and  File:AirknightParshath-DB2-FR-SR-UE.png  suggest it could just be an effeminate, long-haired male. Anyone?  「 ダイノ ガイ 千？！ 」 ?  ·  ☎ Dinoguy1000  06:46, August 20, 2011 (UTC)
 
 It's definitely a male in french. We're always consider it as a male.  Wilimut   Talk Mail  Paris, 14:08, August 20, 2011 (UTC) 
 Black Luster Soldier 
 Thought we agreed that Black Luster Soldier was male at  Forum:Black Luster Woman? . 
On a related note; so... no one still has access to  The Duelists of the Roses game ?  - Falzar FZ - ( talk page | useful stuff )  08:33, August 23, 2011 (UTC)
 
 I wasn't aware of that discussion; if you want to un-tag BLS and related cards, then, go ahead. =) 
 My friend had DOR years ago, and I played it some, but he lost the game some time ago (and I don't have a PS2/PS3 that I could play it on anyways). I remember I was working on documenting fusions (I think I still have the list somewhere, too).  「 ダイノ ガイ 千？！ 」 ?  ·  ☎ Dinoguy1000  17:10, August 23, 2011 (UTC) 
 I have  The Duelists of the Roses , but I haven't got "Black Luster Soldier" in it. In the manga and the artwork for " Black Luster Soldier - Envoy of the Beginning " it definitely looks male to me. In its original appearance "Black Luster Soldier" was " Gaia the Fierce Knight " suffused by chaos. I think "Gaia" is definitely male, so that should mean "Black Luster Solider" is male. --  Deltaneos  ( talk ) 22:05, August 23, 2011 (UTC) 
 If that's indeed the case, it has some of the most misleading card artwork I've ever seen. >_> Its origin isn't mentioned on  Card Trivia:Black Luster Soldier , BTW.  「 ダイノ ガイ 千？！ 」 ?  ·  ☎ Dinoguy1000  22:18, August 23, 2011 (UTC) 
 So I managed to gain access to a copy of Duelists of the Roses with every card unlocked; would it be correct to say, if you move Cyber Shield onto a monster; if it equips, then the monster is female; if the monster is destroyed, the monster is male? 
 Did that to Black Luster Soldier and it was destroyed. 
 On a not so related topic; I'll upload a new version of  File:Back-DOR-VG.png  when I figure out (or if someone tells me) where the best view of the back can be obtained. Right now, I think it's when a Spell/Trap is activated.  - Falzar FZ - ( talk page | useful stuff )  13:40, August 24, 2011 (UTC) 
 When looking at details of a card there should also be section that lists applicable Equip Cards. 
 I think the current backing image was taken from the intro. It's a long time since I've played the game. The aerial view of face-down cards isn't that good, is it? 
 Since you have access to every card, could you get a not-so-blurred image of " Carat Idol ", images of " Larva of Moth " and " Pupa of Moth " that show their original stats, a better quality " Fiend Castle " image and an actual card image of " Hightide "? --  Deltaneos  ( talk ) 14:34, August 24, 2011 (UTC) 
 I'm wondering how much work it would be to find and rip these images directly from the game's ROM - I don't know if anyone's ever looked at its files to see if it uses standard file types or in-house custom jobs, but a very brief Google search isn't terribly promising.  「 ダイノ ガイ 千？！ 」 ?  ·  ☎ Dinoguy1000  16:27, August 24, 2011 (UTC) 
 Yeah, it's looking like no one's ever bothered with this game, and what I suspect are the archive files don't have any apparent coherent structure. I've posted a request for others more knowledgeable than I to have a look over at  XeNTaX , maybe we'll get somewhere.  「 ダイノ ガイ 千？！ 」 ?  ·  ☎ Dinoguy1000  19:11, August 24, 2011 (UTC) 
 I've uploaded the version, the image is from the animation at activation of a S/T when the card flies around (not the aerial view of a S/T card). 
 I'll check the rest when I get home. 
 EDIT:  and for the record; here's the  original screenshot .  - Falzar FZ - ( talk page | useful stuff )  03:47, August 25, 2011 (UTC) 
 I've uploaded new versions to the 5 listed above. Unless there's another way to see them, the card images are sort of hard to get at (have to use them in a duel and draw them)... 
 The list appears to be accurate. If it has both Electro-Whip and Cyber Shield, then I'll consider the card as female. 
 Hero Kid is too new to be there. 
 Rogue Doll lists Book of Secret Arts, Bright Potion and Paralyzing Potion only, so I guess dolls don't have genders. 
 Ancient Elf has Electro-Whip, Cyber Shield, etc listed. 
 Airknight Parshath ,  Tactical Warrior ,  Dimensional Warrior  and  Maha Vailo  do not. 
 The Snake Hair  only has Dark Energy, Violet Crystal and Paralyzing Potion; although her 3D model seems to show that she has breasts. 
 Magical Ghost  only has Dark Energy, Violet Crystal and Paralyzing Potion; and his 3D model has a male face. 
 Nemuriko  only has Dark Energy, Black Pendant, Crush Card and Paralyzing Potion 
 Serpentine Princess  has Raising Body Heat, Power of Kaishin and Paralyzing Potion... so genderless or male? 3D seems to be kind of a male... 
 A list of every card in DOR (cards which I can check) can be found  here . 
 - Falzar FZ - ( talk page | useful stuff )  12:12, August 25, 2011 (UTC) 
 Forgot that some girl can be flat-chest, not like Burst Lady's, but further flatter, if you know what I mean. Though Serpentine Princess don't have a set of breasts like rest of other, but she's still a girl because of "Princess" reference. "Princess" is a female title. Never mind Role and "master" reference; they are just for drama and honor, respective. -- F r e d C a t  13:00, August 25, 2011 (UTC) 
 The point was; Serpentine Princess did not have Electro-Whip/Cyber Shield listed. 
 Also; the Japanese name is Nāga; not ...-Hime. It may have been a Konami-fail when it was released in the TCG.  - Falzar FZ - ( talk page | useful stuff )  13:06, August 25, 2011 (UTC) 
 Therefore they used bad google translation to get that name after all? Why not just mail a letter to Konami and reminded them about the translation mistake? Oh never mind that - E-HERO Rampart Blaster had horrible lore. -- F r e d C a t  13:14, August 25, 2011 (UTC) 
 The Snake Hair is based on  Medusa , which is always female in mythology (not sure how much that counts for though). 
 Per its Japanese name, Serpentine Princess is based on the  nāga , which simply means "snake" and is used in reference to snakes (especially cobras) more often then not; when used to describe a half-snake, half-human, there doesn't seem to be one particular gender commonly associated with it. This then is a case of a misleading English translation, and the vaguely feminine appearance of the monster itself doesn't help matters either.  「 ダイノ ガイ 千？！ 」 ?  ·  ☎ Dinoguy1000  15:46, August 25, 2011 (UTC) 
 Ancient Elf  is one of the  Fusion Material Monsters  for  Mystical Sand , which is definitely female, for what it's worth (the other is  Giant Soldier of Stone , which is  not  female by my estimation).  「 ダイノ ガイ 千？！ 」 ?  ·  ☎ Dinoguy1000  02:12, August 26, 2011 (UTC) 
 Fusion Material Monsters shouldn't really count; *points at  Musician King * 
 Maybe DOR considered deities, myths and objects like dolls to be genderless...  - Falzar FZ - ( talk page | useful stuff )  02:44, August 26, 2011 (UTC) 
 True, I'd forgotten about him. Nevertheless, though, from what I've seen, it's a general rule that female Fusion Monsters have at least one female FMM - we shouldn't use it as the ultimate answer, but it can help inform the argument at least.  「 ダイノ ガイ 千？！ 」 ?  ·  ☎ Dinoguy1000  02:49, August 26, 2011 (UTC) 
 Hero Kid? 
 Is  Hero Kid , a guy or a girl? A long time ago, I create a WC07 page about this card and label it male, but I have to ask is it a guy or a girl. Because I felt that I need to change it gender before something bad happen.  WinterNightmare  ( talk  •  contribs ) 04:47, August 25, 2011 (UTC)

 We need more than that: acording to the spanish name of  Dharc the Dark Charmer  he is a girl, so we can't fully trust the spanish name-- 絶望  ( talk  •  contribs ) 03:55, August 27, 2011 (UTC) 
 Well about  Dharc the Dark Charmer , it's always been considered as a female in french too. It's name is clearly feminine.  Wilimut   Talk Mail  Paris, 04:02, August 27, 2011 (UTC)

 Rogue Doll ? 
 Is this one female? It looks like it might be; has it appeared in any games where that can be definitively checked?  「 ダイノ ガイ 千？！ 」 ?  ·  ☎ Dinoguy1000  06:12, August 25, 2011 (UTC)
 
 I'll post this above, where the rest of the DOR stuff is... or maybe I should make a new section for DOR and move everything there.  - Falzar FZ - ( talk page | useful stuff )  12:12, August 25, 2011 (UTC) 
 I don't know if it helps but in French and Spanish, the word doll (Poupée in French and Muñeca in Spanish) is feminine. For me, in my mind, Rogue Doll has always been female. Wilimut   Talk Mail  Paris, 14:33, August 25, 2011 (UTC) 
 I agreed, my french friend, but I also disagreed - because Rogue Doll is making out of things, like with the one Cheese had discussing about (the one with Clockwork or something I forgot). -- F r e d C a t  14:36, August 25, 2011 (UTC) 
 I don't know about French, but in Spanish, nouns are either always male or always female; they never change gender based on what they're describing like adjectives do. This means we can't really use that as a basis for deciding whether a card is female or not.  「 ダイノ ガイ 千？！ 」 ?  ·  ☎ Dinoguy1000  15:36, August 25, 2011 (UTC) 
 In the English manga, Pegasus uses "her" to refer to "Rogue Doll". The face, eye shadow and what seems to be breast plates all seem feminine to me. --  Deltaneos  ( talk ) 19:14, August 25, 2011 (UTC) 
 It's like I referred the car "her" often when having a conservation with male friends. But you get the point, D-Neos. -- F r e d C a t  19:21, August 25, 2011 (UTC) 
 To answer Dinoguy about Spanish, I'm bilingual and I can tell you 100% that Muneca is female consonnance. My stepfather calls his daughter Muneca. No ones will ever call a guy like that... It's clearly female.  Wilimut   Talk Mail  Paris, 02:26, August 26, 2011 (UTC) 
 I obviously defer to the individual who speaks Spanish natively/fluently; all I have to go on are my three years of Spanish in high school. ;)  「 ダイノ ガイ 千？！ 」 ?  ·  ☎ Dinoguy1000  02:32, August 26, 2011 (UTC)

 Is  Night Assailant  a girl? I red  Gravekeeper's Assailant  card trivia and it say that it was resurrect as Night Assailant. Or does it, not have a gender.  WinterNightmare  ( talk  •  contribs ) 22:15, August 25, 2011 (UTC)

 "This card appears to be a departed or spiritual version of 'Gravekeeper's Assailant'." That's mostly just a guess. There's no proof of that. --      Summoned Skull 2:   Electric Boogaloo       22:24, August 25, 2011 (UTC)

 Personally, I'm not seeing where the "Gravekeeper's Assailant is female" thing is coming from; it doesn't look even remotely female once you get past the eyes.  「 ダイノ ガイ 千？！ 」 ?  ·  ☎ Dinoguy1000  23:06, August 25, 2011 (UTC)

 Thank you for bring that name up, can't believe that I forgot her name. So will "Night Assailant" get Misc up? -- F r e d C a t  23:14, August 25, 2011 (UTC) 
 We dont know if the two are the same monster, so Misc sounds fine to me. But even if Night assailant is a deceased Gravekeepers assailant, we dont know if its Yasmin or not, since most Monster cards seem to represent Species not single beings. There might be multiple Gravekeepers assailants so night assailant might be a ancestor of Yasmin and could be male. Another example is Blue eyes white dragon. Some think its female because Kisara is female. But in falsebound kingdom there are three individual white dragons (Azrael, Ibris, Djibril)That means there are 6 answers if you ask for a monsters gender: male, female, genderless, hermaphrodite, unknown and variable. There are cards that represent a unique being and cards thath represent a entire species. There is only one slifer, one Freed one burstinatrix etc which have a determined gender (unknown, male and female respectively), but there are multiple Blue eyes white dragons with can have either gender. Yasmin is A female Gravekeepers assailant, but there might be other gravekeepers assailants some male and some female. But thats just my theory. -- SG-27  ( talk  •  contribs ) 10:58, August 31, 2011 (UTC) 
 Good point, my friend. But remember that game are not canon to Anime. Because most of games only taken part of the Anime and change the rest - like Marik's Deck for explain? Yea, don't believe that Falsebound Kingdom is relating to Anime. -- F r e d C a t  11:03, August 31, 2011 (UTC)

 Is Masked Beast Des Gardius a female?

Other guy:  not female for god' s sake it a demon look at it . Just because it has "demon" appearance doesn't mean it could be female.

WinterNightmare  ( talk  •  contribs ) 02:08, March 24, 2012 (UTC)
 
 It's female; the partially-absorbed humanoid in the demon's chest unmistakably has breasts. Now knowing that there is a creature in its chest, it is even visible in the OCG/TCG card artwork, regardless of the fact the monster's arm has been moved to mostly eclipse the creature.  「 ディノ 奴 千？！ 」 ?  ·  ☎ Dinoguy1000  04:33, March 24, 2012 (UTC)

 No, Spirit itself don't related to the person - though all other monsters are. Like " Mudora " being summoned by  Isis , and Mudora is male for explain. It approve same with "Blue-Eyes White Dragon" and the former owner (before  Priest Seto ) for this reason. -- F r e d C a t  01:37, April 9, 2012 (UTC) 
 Actually, if you paid attention to the plot of "Memory World", what made Kisara unique was that her ka (monster spirit) and ba (actual human soul) were one. Meaning, that her individual soul WAS the Blue-Eyes White Dragon. Kisara IS Blue-Eyes. That's why if it was pulled from her body, she would die. So yes, the Blue-Eyes White Dragon is female. It should be on the list. Makoeyes987  ( talk  •  contribs ) 03:41, June 14, 2012 (UTC)Makoeyes987

For example, the card  Amazoness Spellcaster  is represented by a woman even in its name, so it makes sense to list it as female. But how is "The A. Forces" a female?

 Well since you've brought it up, I've long wanted to  revamp this page . The anime, manga and some games specifically name certain cards as female. We should only be listing those specific monsters here. However, this list began when the wiki was in its younger stages and people just keep doing what they've been doing all along. The main argument for continuing this way is that a lot of users want to see a listing of all cards with females in them. That can be solved with maintaining a unofficial listing on the forum, the way we do the controversial  "Numbers" Xyz Monster Trivia . A big step would be to obtain a list of cards from the games that are noted as female, but no one has done so as of yet. -- Golden Key  ( talk  •  contribs ) 01:32, October 25, 2013 (UTC)

 Orea and Nepthys 
 Orea  is stated to be female according to this:  http://www.ygorganization.com/ocg-sylvan-backstory-funtime/ 
 Also, on this page:  http://yugioh.wikia.com/wiki/Sacred_Phoenix_of_Nephthys_%28character%29 
 We have Nepthys listed as female, which makes sense since the deity Nepthys was female.  Forestfleet  ( talk  •  contribs ) 05:29, July 17, 2014 (UTC)
 
 XX-Saber Hyunlei 
 Latest episode actually bothered to give us a direct shot at her big breasts, lol. So yeah, she should be added into the list. Order  ( talk  •  contribs ) 00:04, September 22, 2014 (UTC)
 
 Oh, that was a given before the episode. She's already listed as female on her card page, but SMW being glitchy and all, that's why she isn't on the list. -- UltimateKuriboh  ( talk  •  contribs ) 00:15, September 22, 2014 (UTC) 
 Purpose of this page 
 In its current form, I find this page largely useless. I think it should focus on the functional situations in which a monster being female matters. For example, in video games which have card effects that only affect female monsters, all the affected monsters should be tagged (and likewise for effects that only affect male monsters, which we don't currently do).  TCG / OCG  cards do not need to be here because there is no functional significance of gender in those media.
 Anime and manga I'm not entirely sure how to handle, but it might just be best to avoid the constant speculation and just make mentions of the specific cards with gender-dependent effects, and which cards were demonstrated to have functionally significant genders. -- Snorlax Monster  09:34, June 3, 2016 (UTC)
 
 In the many years I've been using the Yu-Gi-Oh! Wikia, I never understood why there was a differentiation. 
 Ok, I now see some video games may treat them differently. And I'm aware of  manga Zombiestein . But I also don't think it's necessary to have lots of  TCG / OCG   cards tagged with this.  Becasita   Pendulum   ( talk  •  contribs )  10:04, June 3, 2016 (UTC) 
 Is it worth accommodating for the portion of the fandom that are simply interested in knowing what female cards there are, beyond their impact on gameplay? Such as they want a female character or a character with a all-female Deck for their fanfic. Mutter, mutter feminism, lust, misogyny, misandry. While the reasons may be virtuous or objectionable, the interest exists. Is it worth listing all female cards for this interest? --  Deltaneos  ( talk ) 21:33, June 3, 2016 (UTC) 
 You know? You're right. People could be interested in that. It's still a search criteria. Might be convenient. 
 I take my previous post back, that said. Thanks.  Becasita   Pendulum   ( talk  •  contribs )  22:01, June 3, 2016 (UTC)
 I think that kind of thing might be better served on the trivia pages of the respective cards. The problem is that we don't have definitive confirmation on the gender of every single card, so a page like this is necessarily going to be either incomplete or speculative. 
 Another problem I have is the low standard for inclusion and ultimate subjectivity, particularly for non-Monster Cards. We have cards like " Ritual Sanctuary " and " Malevolent Nuzzler " in this category, which while they do feature females in their artwork, the subjects of the cards themselves are not females. It also leads to very confusing cases, such as " Risebell the Summoner " being tagged as female because it includes a female in its artwork, despite the subject of the card not being female (hopefully we don't end up with alternate artworks messing this up). 
 I don't really see why we would single out female for people who want to make themed Decks or write fanfics. I could just as easily suggest tagging all blue cards (which would have similar inclusion issues to female cards) or all minotaurs. In fact, there are other arbitrary categories with significance in the video games too, such as  cards that have shells . If we want to note properties like gender or color when they have no mechanical significance (and especially when they are not particularly well-defined), those should not use search categories. -- Snorlax Monster  11:44, July 26, 2016 (UTC) 
 In addition to the above, a solution to wanting to please the people who have a vested interest in categorising cards as such would be to take the names of "female" cards we've currently tagged, and paste them into a forum topic the way we did  Billy Deck . We can then remove the female category from all cards that have not been specifically designated as such in a form of media. This has been talked about before, and Dinoguy's had a draft for revising this page for ages. -- Golden Key  ( talk  •  contribs ) 12:37, July 26, 2016 (UTC) 
 A forum topic would probably be suitable for the general subject of female cards, and its manually maintained nature would allow distinguishing cases where the subject of the card is female versus its artwork simply featuring female monsters/characters, as well as an easier way to handle alternate artworks (and it would also allow proper documentation of cases where a card is referred to or treated as female e.g. in the anime or manga despite not obviously being female itself - e.g. BEWD, which is the ka of a female character and IIRC therefore generally treated as female itself).
 Dinoguy's had a draft for revising this page for ages 
 I have? Is this something I've mentioned before? Because I don't remember any such draft, don't have one saved in my userspace (which is where I would have stuck it if I saved it as a draft), and don't have one squirreled away in any open tab in my browser...  「 ディノ 奴 千？！ 」 ?  ·  ☎ Dinoguy1000  12:49, July 26, 2016 (UTC) 
 Are you thinking of  your sandbox , Key? You linked it in a previous topic above, but it hasn't been touched for a few years now (and I've never messed with it).  「 ディノ 奴 千？！ 」 ?  ·  ☎ Dinoguy1000  12:53, July 26, 2016 (UTC) 
 How very strange. I remembered that I started something, but I thought someone else had already made a better version, so I stopped.  Somehow  I must have been thinking about  this . Hehe, whoops. -- Golden Key  ( talk  •  contribs ) 13:49, July 26, 2016 (UTC) 
 I don't understand the trivia page suggestion. A list alerts/reminds you of the existence of female cards. If you're viewing a trivia page, you'll already aware of the card and in most cases won't need to be told its gender. "* This card is female." on each trivia page is too much. 
 "All models are wrong, but some are useful." The page acknowledgingly lists cards which may be disputed, but it still succeeds in informing people of the majority of female cards. 
 I also don't like that cards depicting females, but whose subjects aren't female, are listed. I think they should be removed either way. 
 There is more of a demand for knowing what  OCG  cards are female than which ones are blue or shelled. 
 I don't mean to come across as a huge supporter of this page. I just want to put the logic on the table. If the "there's a portion of people interested in knowing" case is too narrow to warrant inclusion, I'd be happy to strip this page down to just the mediums where female is a mechanic and if desired, let the forum handle the rest. --  Deltaneos  ( talk ) 19:13, July 26, 2016 (UTC)
