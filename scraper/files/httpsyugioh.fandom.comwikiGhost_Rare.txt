 Ghost Rare , known as  Holographic Rare  in the  OCG , is a rarity introduced in the  TCG  version of  Tactical Evolution .
 Ghost Rare cards have a very shiny silver lettering for the card name, much like a  Secret Rare , with some colors removed from the card image. The body of the  monster  itself seems split, making the image look 3D. If a light is shone on the card image, the color changes. As a result, it can be hard to make out the monster on a card colored this way. At a certain angle the image's color is somewhat restored with the same colors as the normal card just in a dimmer version. The overall effect of these changes is a pale, "ghost-like" appearance to the card art, especially when scanned. Starting with the TCG set Legendary Duelists: Rage of Ra released in September 2020, the  Level / Rank  and  Attribute  of the card are also holofoil, to match how  Super Rare  and  Ultra Rare  cards have been printed since July of 2017.
 Ghost/Gold Rare  cards, a hybrid between Ghost Rare and  Gold Rare , can also be found in the  Gold Series: Haunted Mine  packs.
 From  Tactical Evolution  to  Lord of the Tachyon Galaxy  the  cover card  of a pack was released as Ghost Rare, with the exception of " Rainbow Neos " in  Phantom Darkness . From  Judgment of the Light  onward, the Cover Cards are no longer automatically the Ghost Rare for the set—now the Ghost Rare can be any one of the Secret Rares featured in that set (the exception being " Dark Rebellion Xyz Dragon " in  The New Challengers , and " Clear Wing Synchro Dragon " in " Crossed Souls " which were both a cover card and a Secret Rare). Starting with  Breakers of Shadow , Ghost Rares are no longer going to be present in regular booster sets. "The Winged Dragon of Ra" has since been reprinted as a Ghost Rare in  Legendary Duelists: Rage of Ra .
 On the Official Card Database, this rarity is labelled as Holographic Rare.
