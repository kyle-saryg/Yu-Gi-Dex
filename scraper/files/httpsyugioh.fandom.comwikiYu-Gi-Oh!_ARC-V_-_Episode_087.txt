 Summary 
 In the  Duel Palace  the  Topsiders  cheer  Yuya's  name, while the  Commons  cheer for  Crow . Outside in the streets of  New Domino City ,  Sora  looks up at the Capital Building, thinking that this is where Yuya is being kept. But then to his shock he hears  Melissa Trail  announcing that the first match of the semi-finals is Yuya vs. Crow, and he wonders why Yuya is Dueling while he should be held captive by  Sector Security . 
 
       The device  in  Yuya's  helmet.     
 In the Sector Security Headquarters,  Jean-Michel Roget  places a white knight down, admitting that he would have preferred having Yuya undertake the mind-altering surgery, but thanks to  Declan Akaba 's interference his plans were slightly disrupted. However Roget must have Yuya win this Duel with great flash and splendor; he'll need Yuya to defeat Crow with such an awe-inspiring performance to ensure that all of New Domino City won't be able to take their eyes off him. While Yuya does that, Roget will have  Sergey  (who is sitting inside a van outside the Capital Building with Sector Security officers and his left eye glowing red) eliminate Declan and the  High Council . Roget needs to have  Zuzu Boyle  and  Celina  in his hands after all. In order to accomplish this Roget has prepared a device in Yuya's helmet. Yuya picks the helmet up, unaware of the contents, and he thinks that Roget has restrained the Council and Declan so that he can take control of  this world . As he walks down the corridor he muses that Roget is also after Zuzu and Celina, and Yuya is the only one who can do something about it (he does not think about Zuzu or Celina in the dub). Roget thinks to himself that all of the pieces are in place, and he moves a white knight, telling Yuya to make it flashy for him, enough that it is fitting to celebrate Roget's success in gaining control over this dimension.
 
       Yuya  and  Crow  talk about the situation.     
 Fireworks explode in the night sky as Melissa states that now it's time for the entrance of both players; Yuya Sakaki and Crow Hogan. Yuya waits at the starting line on his  Duel Runner  as the crowd continues to cheer his and Crow's names, while Crow roars up on the  Blackbird . Crow stops beside Yuya and retracts his visor, before apologizing to Yuya. He admits that he thought that Yuya and the  Lancers  were working with the Topsiders, but when  Shay  told Crow that Shay had to defeat  Duel Academy  for the kids back in his  homeland  Crow came to his senses; if the Lancers are fighting such a huge enemy just like the Commons are, there's no way they'd be working for the Topsiders. Yuya whispers Crow's name and Crow continues that he's going to win this Duel for the kids, no not just for them, but for the future of all of New Domino City as well. That's why Crow can't afford to lose this Duel. Yuya admits that it's the same for him; he's made up his mind to win the  Friendship Cup  and bring smiles to everyone in New Domino City. Yuya will win this and defeat  Jack  so that he can tell people just what makes Dueling wonderful. He tightens his hand on his accelerator, lamenting that right now he can't do that. Crow is surprised by the statement and he asks why not. Yuya explains that Declan and the Council are currently being held captive by Sector Security. Crow is shocked to learn that Yuya's comrades have been captured. Yuya explains Roget is trying to take over New Domino City. Crow is shocked that the Director of Sector Security is trying to rule New Domino City, and he laments that if Sector Security become the top power in New Domino City then the Commons will be further oppressed. Yuya states that that's why he has to stop Roget, and so Yuya needs Crow to do something for him. Crow grins and he lowers his visor, reassuring Yuya that he doesn't know what Yuya's plan is, but he can leave it to Crow.
 Meanwhile  Yugo  speeds down the streets and he screeches to a halt at a dead end. He laments that he can't find  Yuri  anywhere and wonders where he could have gone. In another street,  Moon Shadow  carries Celina on his back while Riley walks beside them, while in the Capital Building Declan watches the beginning of Yuya and Crow's Duel. 
 Melissa declares that it's finally time for the beginning of their Night Duel as she stands in her helicopter. She compares the night's stage for the match as jewels and gems scattered form an overturned treasure box as the helicopter hovers above the arena. Below her, Sora rushes up the stairs and muses to himself that something must have happened, otherwise Yuya wouldn't be allowed to Duel (in the dub, he thinks that he has to rescue Yuya). He sees Melissa's helicopter alighting above him, and runs towards it, vowing to save Yuya and asking Zuzu to wait for him. With that Sora leaps into the air and snags onto the helicopter's wheel as it lifts off. Melissa declares, "Action Field: On!  Field Spell :  Crossover Acceleration !" and the purple light suffuses the city. Crow and Yuya's Duel Runners declare, "Duel Mode: On, Autopilot: Standby" and the holographic counter appears. As Jack watches the countdown, Melissa declares "Turbo Duel…Acceleration!" and Crow and Yuya start off with a cry of "Duel!" Melissa states that both Duelists started at almost the same time, and reiterates that the first player out of the Duel Palace will take the first turn. She wonders who it will be, and the two Runners dip into the exit from the Duel Palace. Crow is the first to emerge, as Melissa declares. 
 Crow declares his turn. He Summons " Blackwing - Bora the Spear " and then  Sets  a card, ending his turn. He muses that Roget is trying to take over New Domino City, and wonders whether this is why their semi-final match began so soon. In that case Crow has no reason to go along with it. Yuya muses that Roget is originally from Duel Academy, and he thinks that he can't imagine a city being controlled by someone who rules a class-driven society with brute force to become peaceful. As Crow and Yuya move along a corner, Crow thinks that the future isn't something given to you, but something one has to grasp with their own hands (in the dub, Yuya and Crow think about how to stop Roget). That's why he's decided that he'll help Yuya. He cheerfully suggests to Yuya that they have a real match after they get control of the future that they want, and Yuya agrees that it's a promise. Crow tells Yuya to go ahead and make it flashy.
 
       Yuya  and  Crow's   Tokens  dance and entertain their audience.     
 Yuya moves his Runner forwards and he cheers "LADIES AND GENTLEMEN! ("Greetings, one and all! On with the show!" in the dub)" He states that in this night sky of the city overflowing with light, they will be able to feat their eyes on a beautiful flower of entertainment that will bloom right before them. He declares his turn and draws " Amazing Pendulum ", before telling the crowd to enjoy this beautiful and energetic dance. He claims that he's about to activate the  Quick-Play Spell Card  " Hippo Carnival ", but then he excuses himself and apologizes. He suggests that they top that with " Super Hippo Carnival ", which  Special Summons  " Performapal Hip Hippo " from his hand and then Special Summons as many " Hippo Tokens " as possible to his field. He tells the hippos to come forth, and four "Hippo Tokens" appear. Yuya tells them to dance, and the five hippo monsters dance above him. He asks the crowd what they think, and states that that was the Hippo Dancers of the Super Hippo Carnival. Yuya tells the crowd to please enjoy the entrancing dance of these five hippos to their hearts' content (in the dub, he also tells the kids in their homes to dance along). The crowd cheers and Melissa praises Yuya's amazing leading play; he's captured the hearts of the audience with his monsters' dance. Crow laughs that he won't let Yuya hog all the spotlight. He activates the  Trap Card , " Blackwing - Festival ", which Special Summons three " Blackwing Tokens " to his field since his opponent Special Summoned a monster. Three trumpet-shaped tokens appear on the field and Crow encourages them to dance with the hippos. Melissa is surprised, and she irritably asks if the two of them are just messing around. She protests that this is an official Friendship Cup match and the entirety of New Domino City is watching, so they should take this seriously. Crow replies that they aren't messing around but are in fact completely serious. He thinks that it's about time to do it, and Yuya thanks Crow and states that he's in Crow's debt in his head as they come within view of the Capital Building. Yuya accelerates, and Crow muses that while one can't stop a Duel Runner on autopilot, they can simply jump off it. He urges Yuya to jump and go to his friends and their future. 
 
         Yuya  clutches his head in pain.     
 But Roget states that he won't let Yuya go anywhere; he's going to work as Roget's pawn. He touches a control on his screen and the device in Yuya's helmet shocks him, causing Yuya to scream in pain. Yuya clutches his head and wonders what that was. Watching the Duel, Roget muses that Yuya's helmet contains a device that sends electrical shocks to the brain. After countless experiments Roget has discovered that stimulating a certain part of the brain increases the aggressiveness of a subject. They didn't have time to perform proper brain surgery, but this is more than sufficient to have Yuya provide a flashy Duel. Roget increases the power of the device, telling Yuya to show him a Duel that will make it impossible for all of New Domino City to keep their eyes off Yuya. The device activates again and Yuya screams, clutching his head in his hands. Behind him, Crow continues to urge Yuya to jump off his Duel Runner. But Yuya is in too much pain to move, and the Duel Runners pass the Capital Building – missing their chance. Crow asks why Yuya won't go, aren't his friends captured (his friends aren't mentioned in the dub), did Yuya get cold feet? Then he gasps, and he asks Yuya not to tell him (in the dub, Crow believes Yuya lied to him). Yuya just grits his teeth and groans in pain. Roget states that whatever kind of person Yuya may be, he always has his primal instincts. He tells Yuya to call forth to it, bring it to the surface, and he rises from his chair, telling the ferocious power that lies dormant in Yuya to awaken. Roget increases the device to maximum output, telling Yuya to release that power and rampage freely. Yuya howls in agony, and  glowing red eyes open within his own  as he sees a vision of a city being destroyed. 
 On the boat where he escaped from Yugo, Yuri feels a pain in his chest and he gasps. Yugo also feels the sensation, stopping his Duel Runner and wondering what is going on. He sees his  Duel Disk  glowing and takes out the " Clear Wing Synchro Dragon " card from his Extra Deck to see it glowing. In another street, Moon is still carrying Celina when  her bracelet  begins resonating, to everyone's surprise. 
 
         Celina's  bracelet begins to glow.     
 In the  Underground Labor Facility ,  Frank  mutters that Moon said to hide themselves for the time being, but how long will they have to sort through the rubbish?  Tarren  tells him not to complain;  Shinji  and Shay are here too; it's a given that they're all going to break out eventually (in the dub, Tarren laments separating moldy socks from sweaty socks).  Amanda  adds that Sora promised to bring Yuya back as well, so that's got to be the signal. She turns to Zuzu for confirmation, but Zuzu is looking at  her own bracelet  in surprise as it resonates like Celina's is. Amanda and Tanner ask why the bracelet is glowing and Zuzu admits that she doesn't know. She protests that it can't be, but something must be happening to Yuya.
 
         The repeated shocks cause  Yuya  to  Awaken .     
 Yuya continues to clutch his head in his hands as the Duel Runners continue down the highway, and then he arches his back with a scream. 
 
         Yuri   Awakens  for the first time.     
         Yugo   Awakens .     
 Yuri screams in agony as his eyes glow purple and he awakens for the first time, and Yugo howls as well as his eyes glow aqua. 
 Yuya lets his head fall forwards with his irises glowing red. Crow asks Yuya what is wrong (in the dub, he says Yuya tried to trick him), but Yuya activates the  Spell Card  " Catastrophe Draw " instead of responding, destroying his five hippo monsters to draw two cards. Darkness flows freely from Yuya as Yuri and Yugo mirror his actions, drawing random cards of their own. Yuya uses the Scale 3 " Xiangke Magician " and the Scale 8 " Xiangsheng Magician " to Set the  Pendulum Scale . Yuya explains that he can now simultaneously Summon monsters from  Levels   4  to  7 . Yuri  chants , "Swing, pendulum of the soul!" and Yugo chants, "Draw an arc of light across the aether!" All of them declare, " Pendulum Summon !" and Yuya chants "Come forth, my monster servant!" Yuri chants, "With your heroic and dichromatic eyes…" and Yugo finishes " Odd-Eyes Pendulum Dragon ! ((Dub) "Swing far, pendulum! Carve the arc of victory! My monsters are ready - SO ready - to swing into action! Turn up the heat, Odd-Eyes Pendulum Dragon!")" Yuya activates the Pendulum Effect of "Xiangsheng Magician" to make one monster on the field the same as another monster. He increases the Level of "Bora" to 7, the same as the Level of "Odd-Eyes", much to Crow's shock.
 
         Yuri ,  Yugo  and  Yuya  command " Odd-Eyes " to attack " Bora the Spear ".     
 Yuya declares his  Battle Phase , and Yuri tells "Odd-Eyes Pendulum Dragon" to go, as Yugo orders it to attack "Blackwing - Bora the Spear". Yuya chants, "Odd-Eyes! With your dichromatic eyes lay waste to all you see before you!  Spiral Flame Strike !" "Odd-Eyes" blasts a plume of crimson flames at "Bora", enveloping the  Winged Beast  as it groans in pain. Crow protests that this is different to what they had planned, but Yuya and Yuri declare the effect of "Odd-Eyes Pendulum Dragon". Yugo and Yuya explain that battle damage when it attacks a  Level 5  or higher monster is doubled, and all three of them shout "Reaction Force!" as the orange fire is added to the crimson and "Bora" is destroyed, reducing Crow to 2400  LP . Melissa cheers the 1600 damage in an instant, noting that this was why Yuya increased the Level of "Bora". She notes that the switch from a carefree atmosphere to a hard battle style is likely two sides of the coin of Yuya's entertainment. Completely missing the point, Melissa apologizes for getting mad without taking the time to read ahead. Yuya ends his turn. Roget laughs and praises Yuya for showing Roget a reaction far greater than he expected. He tells Yuya to make these Duels more exciting just like that (in the dub, Roget celebrates Yuya failing his mission). 
 
         " Raikiri " wipes out  Yuya's  field.     
 Crow angrily asks Yuya if he was going to rescue his comrades. He muses that if Yuya led him on like this then he must really be in league with the Topsiders. He declares his turn and draws, vowing not to show mercy if Yuya did all of this just to trick him. He Summons " Blackwing - Calima the Haze " from his hand, and then since he controls a "Blackwing" monster he Special Summons the  Tuner monster  " Blackwing - Gale the Whirlwind " from his hand. He  tunes  the Level 4 "Calima the Haze" with the  Level 3  "Gale the Whirlwind" and he chants "Spread your pitch-black wings and storm forth in tandem with the rising thunder! Slash apart the lightning!  Synchro Summon ! Cascade!  Assault Blackwing - Raikiri the Rain Shower ! ("You shouldn't have tried to mess with me, Yuya! I Synchro Summon! Spread your wings, Assault Blackwing - Raikiri the Rain Shower!" in the dub)" Crow activates the effect of "Raikiri", destroying a card Yuya controls for each "Blackwing" monster Crow controls. He declares that Yuya's field is wide open as "Raikiri" releases three slashes of light that destroy "Odd-Eyes", "Xiangke Magician" and "Xiangsheng Magician". Then Crow attacks directly with "Raikiri", and as the strike reduces Yuya to 1400 LP he, Yuri and Yugo grit their teeth in pain. Melissa praises Crow's counterattack; Yuya lost all the cards on his field and took a huge hit of 2600 damage. Crow angrily asks if Yuya has learnt his lesson yet, before he Sets two cards to end his turn. Yuya growls in rage; the darkness he is exuding now covering his Duel Runner as well. 
 
         All four counterparts have now awakened at the same time.     
 Celina and Zuzu, each with their separate groups of friends, watch their bracelets resonating. Up in the air, Sora watches in concern from the wheel of Melissa's helicopter. Yuya, Yuri, Yugo, and now even  Yuto  declare their turn and draw, and Sora gasps in shock as he remembers  his Duel  with Yuto and observes in surprise that just for an instant, Yuya's face reminded him of Yuto's and he wonders why (in the dub, he says this isn't like Yuya). Yuya activates the Spell Card "Amazing Pendulum" from his hand; he has no cards in his  Pendulum Zones  he can add two  Pendulum Monsters  from his  Extra Deck  to his hand. He returns "Xiangke Magician" and "Xiangsheng Magician" to his hand and then Sets them again, allowing him to simultaneously Summon monsters from Levels 4 to 7. He declares "Pendulum Summon!" and Yuri chants "Revive from my Extra Deck! Odd-Eyes Pendulum Dragon! ("Return to the front lines to fight, Odd-Eyes Pendulum Dragon!" in the dub)" Yugo adds that he also Pendulum Summons " Performapal Longphone Bull " from his hand. "Longphone Bull's" horn rings like a phone as Yuya explains that he can add a " Performapal " monster with 1000 or less  ATK  from his Deck to his hand, and he adds " Performapal Skeeter Skimmer " to his hand before Summoning it. Yuri and Yugo then  overlay  the Level 4 "Longphone Bull" and "Skeeter Skimmer", and Yuya chants "Fangs formed from pitch-black darkness!" while Yuto chants, "Rise up against the foolish oppression! Descend now!" All four counterparts declare " Xyz Summon !" and Yuya chants, "Appear now!  Rank 4 !  Dark Rebellion Xyz Dragon ! ((Dub) "Cloaked in shadows and relentless in its objective, I call upon the most dangerous of dragons! I Xyz Summon  Dark Rebellion Xyz Dragon !")" Sora gasps that Yuya has even Summoned Yuto's  dragon  and he wonders if that is even really Yuya Dueling right now, as images of Yuya's counterparts appear next to him, their eyes all glowing.
 
 Featured Duel: Yuya Sakaki vs. Crow Hogan 
         Yuya  vs.  Crow .     
 At the start of the  Duel , the  Field Spell Card  " Crossover Acceleration " is  activated , as per the rules of an  Action Duel  and a  Turbo Duel . It will allow the players to use  Action Cards , but they may only have one in their  hand  at a time.

 Yuya   draws  " Amazing Pendulum ". He  activates  " Super Hippo Carnival ", allowing him to  Special Summon  " Performapal Hip Hippo " (800/800) from his hand,  Deck  or  Graveyard  and four " Hippo Tokens ". He Special Summons "Hip Hippo" from his hand and the four "Hippo Tokens" (0/0 each), all in  Attack Position . As  monsters  were Special Summoned to his opponent's field and he  controls  a " Blackwing " monster, Crow activates his  face-down , " Blackwing - Festival ", Special Summoning three " Blackwing Tokens " (0/0 each).
 At this point, Yuya  Awakens  due to a chip in his helmet being triggered by  Jean-Michel Roget .
 Yuya activates " Catastrophe Draw ",  destroying  his five monsters to draw two cards. Yuya activates " Xiangke Magician " (   3) and " Xiangsheng Magician " (   8) in his  Pendulum Zones . Yuya  Pendulum Summons  " Odd-Eyes Pendulum Dragon " (2500/2000) in  Attack Position . He then activates the  Pendulum Effect  of "Xiangsheng Magician", letting him change the  Level  of a monster on the field to the same as another monster on the field, until the end of the  turn . Yuya changes the Level of "Bora the Spear" to that of "Odd-Eyes" ("Bora the Spear":   4 → 7). Yuya's hand contains "Amazing Pendulum" and " Supreme Wing ". "Odd-Eyes"  attacks  and destroys "Bora the Spear", with the former's  effect  doubling the  battle damage  as it  battled  a Level 5 or higher monster (Crow: 4000 → 2400 LP).
 Turn 3: Crow 
Crow Normal Summons " Blackwing - Calima the Haze " (600/1800). As Crow controls a "Blackwing" monster, he Special Summons " Blackwing - Gale the Whirlwind " (1300/400) in Attack Position.

Crow activates the effect of "Raikiri", allowing him to destroy a number of cards Yuya controls up to the number of "Blackwing" monsters he currently controls. As he controls four "Blackwing" monsters, Crow destroys "Odd-Eyes", "Xiangke", and "Xiangsheng". "Raikiri" attacks  directly  (Yuya: 4000 → 1400 LP). Crow Sets two cards.
 Turn 4: Yuya 
Yuya activates "Amazing Pendulum", allowing him to  add  two  Pendulum Monsters  from his  Extra Deck  to his hand as he has no cards in his Pendulum Zones. He adds and subsequently activates "Xiangke Magician" (   3) and "Xiangsheng Magician" (   8) in his Pendulum Zones. Yuya Pendulum Summons "Odd-Eyes" (2500/2000) from his Extra Deck and " Performapal Longphone Bull " (1600/1200) from his hand, both in Attack Position. The effect of "Longphone Bull" activates as it was Summoned, letting Yuya add a " Performapal " monster with 1000 or less  ATK  from his Deck to his hand. Yuya adds and subsequently Normal Summons  Performapal Skeeter Skimmer " (500/1600).
