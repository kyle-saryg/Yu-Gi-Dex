 Michael "Mikey" , known in Japan as  Miruko , was the younger brother of  Alister . In the original Japanese version, Mikey was killed when a tank he boarded was blown up. In the English anime, Mikey was said to have been captured. In either case, the event serves as the basis of Alister's vendetta against  Seto Kaiba . Mikey's favorite toy was his  Dyna Dude  action figure, which his brother holds on to in memory of him.
