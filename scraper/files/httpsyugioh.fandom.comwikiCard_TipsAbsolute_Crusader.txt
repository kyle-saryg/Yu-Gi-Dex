 This card can be searched by " Single Purchase ", " Temple of the Kings ", " Ties of the Brethren ", " Painful Escape ", " Transmodify ", " Witch of the Black Forest ", " Field-Commander Rahz ", " Freed the Matchless General ", " Reinforcement of the Army ", " Resonator Engine ", " Vampire Dragon ", " Summoner Monk ", " Soul Rope ", " BOXer ", " Frontline Observer ", " Dragunity Corsesca " and " Dragodies, the Empowered Warrior ". 
 Because this card's effect is mandatory, it will always activate before any optional effect. Your opponent cannot use the  Ignition Effect  of a monster like " XX-Saber Faultroll " or " Chaos Sorcerer " before it is destroyed, since those effects are  Spell Speed 1  and cannot be chained.
 Furthermore, this card works in the  Damage Step , so it can destroy monsters such as " Tragoedia " and " Gorz the Emissary of Darkness ". 
 This card is best used in decks using  Rank 4  or lower  Xyz Monsters , or  Link Monsters  that do not require high-Level monsters as material. To access higher Ranks without Special Summoning high-Level monsters, use Level modulation effects such as " Tannhauser Gate " or " Infinitrack Anchor Drill ". 
 Traditional Format 
 This card can be searched by  " M-X-Saber Invoker ".
