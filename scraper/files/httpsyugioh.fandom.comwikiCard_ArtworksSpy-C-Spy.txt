 Several changes are made between this card's Japanese and international artwork:
 The man's cigar and wine glass have been removed, with the man's fingers, mouth, and mustache adjusted slightly to compensate. 
 The spy's bust size has been reduced and her dress is redrawn to get rid of the bare leg and garter. 
 The woman to the right has been slightly cropped to remove her slightly exposed breast. 
 A wine bottle has been recolored and its label removed, and a second wine bottle has been replaced with a plate of food. 
 The facial expression of one of the men in the background with hearts in his eyes has been changed.
