      Kaiba's bodyguards     
 Kaiba's bodyguards  are two characters in the  Toei  Yu-Gi-Oh!  anime . They were tasked with guarding  Seto Kaiba  and would carry out disreputable tasks at his behest.
 At least one of the bodyguards is voiced by  Naoki Imamura .
 
 History 
 Kaiba got his bodyguards to help him take cards from students at  Domino High School , using force where necessary. They cornered one  schoolboy  on the roof of the school, demanding his " Dark Magician " card. They boy insisted that the card was a memento to his father and begged them not to take it. They proceeded to beat him and Kaiba arrived in time to take the card. One of the bodyguards then reported that he now acquired all of the cards Kaiba wanted from that school. [1] 
 Katsuya Jonouchi  and  Hiroto Honda  noticed Kaiba stealing a " Blue-Eyes White Dragon " card from  Yugi Mutou  and confronted him over this on the roof of the school. However Kaiba had his bodyguards beat them up. Yugi arrived shortly afterwards and Kaiba told him that Jonouchi and Honda had made a false accusation against him. However Yugi was aware that Kaiba had taken the card and pleaded with him to return it. When Kaiba grew tired of Yugi's persistence, he left his bodyguards to deal with him. However Yugi changed into  Dark Yugi , who managed to injure the bodyguards and leave them unconscious. [1]
