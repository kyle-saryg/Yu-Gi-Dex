 Malcolm  is a resident of  Crash Town .
 
 Biography 
 Malcolm is the leader of the  Malcolm Crew , one of the two gangs of  Crash Town . The other gang, the  Radley Bunch , belongs to  Radley . According to another resident,  Barbara , the two of them came to form their groups as a violent way of forcing people to work in the  Dyne  mines as slaves. Furthermore, these two group use  Duels  to force people to work. 
 Malcolm is first seen losing one of his members in a Duel against  Kalin Kessler , the champion of Radley's group. In anger, he drinks excessively, and is later met by  Yusei Fudo . Yusei asks to join his gang, and Malcolm tests him in a three-on-one Duel against other members. He is amazed as Yusei executes a triple  One Turn Kill . Malcolm accepts him, counting that Yusei will defeat Kalin.  
 After Yusei's Duel with Kalin, Malcolm and Barb double-cross him. Malcolm´s brother,  Lawton , suddenly appears and defeats Radley in a Duel. Malcolm offers Yusei the chance to remain in his gang because of his impressive Dueling skills, but Yusei refuses. Yusei, Kalin and Radley are then sent to the mountains, and Malcolm declares that his family now officially rules the town. 
 At first, Barbara is with him and he even tells her that he'll rename the town and change it instead to "Barbara Town". However Malcolm himself ends up being double-crossed by his own brother and Barb too (with the latter giving him a swift kick). As she favors Lawton, the town name becomes "Lawton Town".    
 Most of the members on his group wear a red scarf.
 
 Trivia 
 Malcolm is likely based upon Miguel Rojo, a character from the Italian-Spanish film,  A Fistful of Dollars .
 Miguel Rojo also has a younger and better brother named Radley Rojo, as Malcolm has  Lawton .
