Shops all over the place are selling out of them.  Anzu , who is with Yugi, tells him that she is also learning Duel Monsters. Grandpa decides to give Yuugi and Anzu each a pack of cards as a present. Yugi and Anzu get all excited over the new pack.
 As they open their packs, a customer walks in the store. Yugi sighs because he already owns the cards from his pack. However, Anzu points out a particular card that interests her and she shows it to Yugi. Yugi recognizes it as " Violet Hecate ". Judging by Yugi's reaction, Anzu asks if it is rare and he says it is extremely rare because it's one of the three witch sisters. It is extremely hard to find those cards, Grandpa has never seen such a card before. Anzu decides to give it to Yugi because she thinks that card would be more useful with him. Yugi gladly accepts the gift from Anzu and jumps in happiness.
 Anzu notices that it's the same kiddish Yugi as always. She wonders where the other Yugi went, the one that saved her? Yugi thanks Anzu for the card. Suddenly, Grandpa notices that the customer that entered the store is missing. He wonders where the customer went.

The letter states that author of the letter has feelings for Yugi and she wants to meet up with him just once at Domino Park. It's signed by  Risa Kageyama . Miho thinks Yugi is popular with the girls, but Yugi doesn't think so. He doesn't even know who the person is, Jonouchi and Honda think Kageyama Risa is a very unattractive girl. Honda describes her as Frankenstein-like, and says all girls with  kana " in their names are like that, Miho realizes that her name has that and she walks away.

Yugi finally comes to an understanding. Risa begins to walk away, but Yugi tells her that she's very pretty. While Risa has her back turned to Yugi, her eyes are evil. She then turns towards Yugi with normal eyes and gives him the socks, hoping they can meet again. Yugi blushes.
 
 Keeping the secret 
 At class, Yugi lies to his friends by saying he hasn't seen Risa since the first time they met. Jounouchi, Honda and Miho are sad by that since they were cheering Yugi on, Yugi notices Anzu hasn't said a word. He secretly apologizes to her, knowing that he lied and he decided that next time he´ll do the properly. On the way home from school, Jounouchi suggests they go somewhere nice on their next day off. Yugi sees Risa hiding behind a tree, knowing that he must meet up with her, Yugi announces that he has some important business to take care of. Jounouchi says goodbye to Yugi, and he runs off to her. However, Anzu remains suspicious.

 Yugi's illness 
         Risa taking care of Yugi.      Anzu knows that Risa isn't good for Yugi and he isn´t capable of turning her down. She angrily decides to head to Yugi's home to get things straighten out with him. When she gets there, Grandpa tells her that Yugi is sick. However, Anzu decides to see him anyway, she runs up to Yuugi's room and opens the door. There, she sees Yugi lying in bed with Risa right by his side. Anzu demands to know why she's there, Risa insists that she be quiet because Yugi is sleeping. She mentions that the house doesn't have any medicine. So Anzu runs off to the pharmacy to get some. As she turns the corner, the evil Risa pops out from behind the corner.
 Anzu comes back with the medicine, but Risa is already there with some. Anzu wonders how she got the medicine so quickly. In the room is also Jonouchi, he met up with Risa at the pharmacy and decided to check on Yugi himself too. Yugi insists that he's fine. Suddenly, Risa notices that she's out of ice so Anzu runs off again to buy some and runs back with some ice, wondering what's up with Risa. When she gets to Yugi's room, Risa already has some. Yugi tells Anzu to just sit back and relax, Honda is also in the room. He explains that he ran into Risa when she was looking for some ice. The ice was heavy, so Honda decided to carry it for her.
 Anzu asks Yugi if he likes mandarins he says yes, so Anzu decides to go to the store again and get some. She throws her back of ice at Honda and runs out the door.
When Anzu arrives at the supermarket, she takes the escalator down. However, the evil Risa is on the escalator that's going up. She pushes Anzu hard and Anzu falls to the bottom of the escalator. Anzu looks up and sees Risa running away. When Anzu runs into Yuugi's room again, she demands to know what Risa was trying to do. Jonouchi asks what's wrong, Anzu accuses Risa of pushing her down the escalator. Jonouchi and Honda don't know what Anzu is talking about, Risa has been in the room the whole time! Anzu doesn't understand. She asks Yugi for confirmation, and Yugi says Risa never left the room. Risa says not to worry about it, her face is common that it can be seen everywhere. Anzu wonders if she wasn't seeing things correctly, but she was sure it was Risa.
 Risa stands up and states she's going home, Jonouchi and Honda are disappointed she's leaving so soon. Risa asks Yugi for a favor: She wants to keep something that belongs to Yugi so that she can always remember him. Suddenly, Risa sees Yugi's Duel Monster cards, she particularly likes the Violet Hekate card and asks to keep it. Yugi tells her that that's the only card that's off limits because he received it from someone very important to him, Anzu knows it's her. Yugi offers her any of his other cards, but Risa declines. She decides to head off without anything. Jonouchi and Honda blame him for making Risa sad. Anzu yells at them, as Yugi quietly apologizes to Risa.
 
 The Kageyama sisters 
 As the sun begins to set, Jounouchi, Honda and Anzu take their leave. Yugi thanks them for their support. Jounouchi and Honda tell Yugi to get some rest since it's important to recover from a cold. Anzu yells at Yugi to hurry up and get back to bed. He says his temperature has gone down, but Anzu refuses to accept that. Honda whispers to Jounouchi that Anzu is like an overprotective wife. As Yugi walks through the door, he thanks Anzu for her support.
 As Yugi walks up the stairs to his room, he hears something. Inside Yugi's room is the evil Risa, who is frantically looking for the Violet Hekate card. Yugi turns on the light and sees Risa with her evil eyes. She grabs Yugi and tells him to hand over the card. As Risa takes Yugi to the ground, an object flies out Yugi's window, breaking the window's glass. Jounouchi, Honda and Anzu see this and think something is wrong. They rush up to Yugi's room and see Risa pinning Yugi to the floor. Jounouchi, Honda and Anzu are surprised to see this. Yugi takes his Millenium Puzzle and swings it at Risa, breaking free from her grip. Anzu knows that Risa was after that card from the very beginning, Yugi can't believe Risa would do something like this.
 Risa takes out her whip and flings it at them. The group runs out of the room just in time. Risa smiles, knowing that they can't run. Honda opens the door to outside, but Risa jumps down and blocks the exit. Screaming in horror, Honda immediately shuts the door, and the group finds another way out. However, Risa also blocks that way too. Jounouchi tackles Risa to the ground, while Yugi and Anzu escape. Unfortunately, Jounouchi can't hold down Risa for very long, as she whips him and breaks free. 
 
         The  Kageyama sisters  take the Millennium Puzzle.     
 Meanwhile, Yugi and Anzu run down the streets. They soon face Risa again, but this time there are three Risas, and they have Yugi and Anzu surrounded. One of the Risas uses her whip to snatch Yugi's Millenium Puzzle away from him. She challenges Yugi to a Duel with the Millenium Puzzle and the Violet Hecate card at stake. Yugi knows he has no choice, so he accepts the challenge.
