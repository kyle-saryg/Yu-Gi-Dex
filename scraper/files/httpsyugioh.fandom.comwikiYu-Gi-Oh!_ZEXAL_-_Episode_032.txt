 Featured Duel: Yuma Tsukumo vs. Charlie McCay 
       Charlie McCay  vs.  Yuma Tsukumo .     
 Turn 1: Yuma 
 Yuma  draws. He then  Sets  a  monster  and a card.
 Turn 2: Charlie 
 Charlie  draws. He then  activates  the  Continuous Spell Card , " Take a Chance ". Now, once per  turn , Charlie may roll a die. If the result is 6, his  Life Points  will be multiplied by 5. If the result is anything else, his Life Points will return to the value he had before the initial activation, he will be unable to activate the  effect  again and he will take 1000  damage  during each of his  Standby Phases . 
 Charlie activates the effect of "Take a Chance" to roll a die and he gets a 6 (Charlie: 4000 → 20000 LP). He then  Normal Summons  " Majestic Jester " ( 1/0/0) in Attack Position. "Majestic Jester"  attacks  Yuma's  face-down  monster, " Gogogo Golem " ( 4/1800/1500). Charlie activates the  effect  of "Majestic Jester" to roll a die. If the result is 6, the attack  target  will be  destroyed . Otherwise, "Majestic Jester" will be destroyed. Charlie gets a 6, so "Gogogo Golem" is destroyed. Charlie Sets a card.
 Turn 3: Yuma 
Yuma draws. He then Normal Summons " Gagaga Magician " ( 4/1500/1000) in Attack Position. Yuma then activates " Monster Slots " to target "Gagaga Magician" and  banish  "Gogogo Golem" from his Graveyard (as "Gogogo Golem" has the same  Level  as "Gagaga Magician") in order to  draw  a card. If the drawn monster is the same Level as the banished monster and the targeted monster, Yuma may  Special Summon  it. Otherwise, the target and the drawn card will be banished. Yuma draws " Gagaga Girl ", so "Gagaga Magician" and "Gagaga Girl" are banished. Yuma's hand contains " Zubaba Knight ", " Ganbara Knight ", and "Commander of Swords".
 
         Charlie  sets a new record for the highest amount of  Life Points .     
 Turn 4: Charlie 
Charlie draws. He then activates the effect of "Take a Chance" and rolls a 6 (Charlie: 20000 → 100000 LP). Charlie activates " Release Change " to  Tribute  "Majestic Jester" and Special Summon " Dice Leveler " ( 1/100/100) in Attack Position (as "Dice Leveler" has the same Level as "Majestic Jester"). Charlie then activates "Monster Slots" to target "Dice Leveler" and banish "Majestic Jester" from his Graveyard to draw a card. Charlie draws "Dice Leveler", so the latter is Special Summoned ( 1/100/100) in Attack Position. Charlie Normal Summons a third "Dice Leveler" ( 1/100/100) in Attack Position. He activates the effects of all three "Dice Levelers", rolling a die for each. The Level of each "Dice Leveler" will increase by an amount equal to the die roll. Charlie gets a 6 for each roll (All three "Dice Leveler":   1 → 7). 
 
                 No. 7 Lucky Stripe V2   The Summoning of "  Lucky Straight "     
 Charlie  overlays  his three "Dice Leveler" in order to  Xyz Summon  " Number 7: Lucky Straight " ( 7/700/700, ORU: 3) in Attack Position. "Lucky Straight" attacks directly. Charlie activates the effect of "Lucky Straight" to roll a die and multiply the ATK of "Lucky Straight" by the die result by  detaching  an Overlay Unit ("Lucky Straight": 3 → 2 ORU). Charlie gets a 6 ("Lucky Straight": 700 → 4200 ATK), but Yuma activates his face-down " Nitwit Outwit " to  send  the " Zubaba Knight " in his hand to the Graveyard and reduce the  Battle Damage  he takes by the ATK of the sent monster (Yuma: 4000 → 1400 LP). At the end of the Battle Phase, the effect of "Lucky Straight" expires ("Lucky Straight": 4200 → 700 ATK).
 Turn 5: Yuma 
Yuma draws. He then Normal Summons " Ganbara Knight " ( 4/0/1800) in Attack Position. As he Normal Summoned a Level 4 monster, Yuma Special Summons " Kagetokage " ( 4/1100/1500) from his hand in Attack Position via its own effect. Yuma overlays "Ganbara Knight" and "Kagetokage" in order to Xyz Summon " Number 39: Utopia " ( 4/2500/2000, ORU: 2) in Attack Position. "Utopia" attacks "Lucky Straight", but Charlie activates his face-down " Dice Crisis " to roll a die. If the result is 6, he can  equip  "Dice Crisis" to "Utopia", take  control  of "Utopia" and reduce its ATK to 0. Charlie get a 6, so he takes control of "Utopia" ("Utopia": 2500 → 0 ATK). Yuma Sets a card.
 Turn 6: Charlie 
As Charlie begins his turn, Yuma activates his face-down " Commander of Swords " as there is a  LIGHT   Warrior - Type  monster on the  field . Charlie will  reveal  his drawn card. If it is a  Spell  or  Trap Card , Yuma may either destroy it or a Spell or Trap Card Charlie controls. Charlie draws " Sun Scale " - a Spell Card. Charlie explains that with "Sun Scale", he can, once a turn, roll a die and if he gets a six, then all monsters Yuma controls will be destroyed. Yuma almost selects to use "Commander of Swords" to destroy "Dice Crisis", which would activate its second to last effect and return control of "Utopia" to Yuma, but, by  Astral 's advice, instead chooses to destroy "Sun Scale" (When "Sun Scale" was destroyed, Charlie lost the good luck granted to him by Number 7).
 As "Sun Scale" was destroyed and sent to the Graveyard, Charlie activates its second effect to inflict 500 damage to Yuma (Yuma 1400 → 900 LP). Charlie activates the effect of "Take a Chance", but he gets a 1 (Charlie: 100000 → 4000), so the effects of all further die rolls are negated.
 Turn 7: Yuma 
Yuma draws " Comeback " and subsequently activates it to target "Utopia" and take control of it as it was a monster he owned. Yuma performs  Chaos Xyz Evolution  and overlays "Utopia" and its Overlay Units in order to Xyz Summon " Chaos Number 39: Utopia Ray " ( 4/2500/2000, ORU: 3) in Attack Position. 
 Yuma then activates the effect of "Utopia Ray" three times to detach all of its Overlay Units ("Utopia Ray": 3 → 0 ORU) and increase its ATK by 500 for each Overlay Unit as well as subsequently decrease the ATK of "Lucky Straight" by 1000 for each Overlay Unit detached ("Utopia Ray": 2500 → 4000 ATK, "Lucky Straight": 700 → 0 ATK). "Utopia Ray" attacks and destroys "Lucky Straight" (Charlie: 4000 → 0 LP).
 
 Trivia 
 Yuma  ordering " Utopia " to attack the sun is paying homage to the infamous moment from the second series anime, where  Yami Yugi  orders " Giant Soldier of Stone " to  attack   the moon .
 In both instances, the cards destroyed were  Spells , and an unrelated gameplay effect occurred after (water dried up after the moon was destroyed, and Charlie's luck disappeared after the sun was destroyed). 
 Multiple times during the Duel,  Astral  makes statements such as "The chance of the next die roll being a 6 is 1/7776", which is factually incorrect (see  gambler's fallacy ). The chance of any die roll being a 6 is always 1/6 regardless of the outcomes of any previous die rolls. The correct statement here is "The chance of rolling five 6's in a row is 1/7776." This is specified more clearly in the English dub.
