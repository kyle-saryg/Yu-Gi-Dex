Link: https://yugioh.fandom.com/wiki/Limbo

Limbo  is an unofficial term for the location where monsters are located before their Summon is successful (during the  Summon negation window ). [1] 
 If a monster's  Summon  is  negated , it is not sent from the  field  or its original location to the  Graveyard . So if the  Normal Summon  or  Flip Summon  of " Sangan " is negated, it will not be able to  activate  its effect because it was sent from 'nowhere' to the Graveyard, not from the field to the Graveyard.
 Since the monsters in  limbo  are not considered to be  face-up  on the field, if they have a  Continuous Effect , it is not applied at the time. So if " Jinzo " would be Normal Summoned, " Solemn Judgment "  can be activated  to negate the Summon. There are some monsters whose effects state that their  Summon cannot be negated , meaning that once the monster leaves its place of origin and enters  limbo , its summon cannot be stopped by "Solemn Judgment" in  limbo , such as " Holactie the Creator of Light ".
 When a  Gemini monster  is  Gemini Summoned , it is moved to  limbo , but  Equip Cards   equipped  to it are not  destroyed  and  Continuous Effects  that target it will not be disrupted (although it will be unaffected by these during the  Summon negation window ). If the Gemini Summon is negated, it is not considered to be sent from the field to the Graveyard, or even to have  left the field  (but Equip Cards equipped to it are destroyed as it is no longer a valid target). As such, if " Nightmare Wheel " targets a face-up Gemini monster treated as a  Normal Monster  which has its Gemini Summon negated, it will remain on the field meaninglessly.
 
 Xyz Materials 
 With the introduction of  Xyz Monsters ,  limbo  has unofficially been used to describe the state in which  Xyz Materials  exist, as they are neither on the field, nor in the graveyard. Entering  limbo  from the  field  does not count as  leaving the field . Being sent to the  Graveyard  from  limbo  does not count as  leaving the field  either.
 
 Yu-Gi-Oh! BAM 
 In the source code of  Yu-Gi-Oh! BAM , during battle, along with usual terms found in that game such as "Attack", "Boost", "Immunity", "Death", "Negative Boost" and "Effect Trigger", the term "Limbo State" can also be found.
