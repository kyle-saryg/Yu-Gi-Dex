      The dorm in its current state.     
 The  Abandoned Dorm , also known in Japan as the  old Blue Dorm , is a location in  Yu-Gi-Oh! GX .
 A year before the events of the anime,  Atticus Rhodes ,  Yusuke Fujiwara  and a few other  Obelisk Blue  students stayed in this dorm, but over time, they vanished. [1]  After the disappearance of these students, many tried to find them, but to no avail and the other students were later prohibited from entering the dorm. [2]  A cover-up story was fed to the public, which stated that the missing students were in a Duel research program abroad. [3]  The official files of the missing students were stored in the dorm in order to hide them, since no one was permitted to enter. [4] 
 
       Amnael 's laboratory in the dorm's basement.     
 Yusuke performed a ritual to summon  Nightshroud  in the dorm. This pulled him to the  World of Darkness  and infected the dorm with dark powers. Atticus received  Nightshroud's mask  from Yusuke as a parting gift after witnessing this. [1]  As a result, Atticus was eventually chosen by  Kagemaru  to be one of the  Shadow Riders . Upon his reappearance, he was saved by  Jaden Yuki . [5]   Lyman Banner , who had aided Kagemaru's plot, would later state that he and Kagemaru were unaware where Atticus received Nightshroud's influence from. [1]  Banner had used the basement of the dorm as his personal alchemy lab, including a resting place for his original body. [6] 
 
       The dorm before its abandonment, in  Atticus'  memory.     
 A journalist named  Gerard  and  Chancellor Sheppard [4]  dedicated themselves to solving the mystery. [7] [4]  The dorm would later be destroyed by  Honest , the  Spirit Partner  of Fujiwara, in his quest to find out what happened to his master. [8] 
 Due to Fujiwara's ritual, it appears that the dorm was imbued with some form of shadow magic. The angry spirits of the dorm were able to start a real  Shadow Game  mid-way through  Jaden's Duel with Titan , who had been holding a faux Shadow Game before that. Upon his loss, he was pulled into  a different  World of Darkness. [2]  After Jaden's defeat of Kagemaru, the remaining students were released. [1] 
 The dorm has also made an appearance in the  manga , as the setting where  Reggie MacKenzie  Dueled against both  Midori Hibiki  and Jaden. Nothing is known about it in this continuity. [9]
