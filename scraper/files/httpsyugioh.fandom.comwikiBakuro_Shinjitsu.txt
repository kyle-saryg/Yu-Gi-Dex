 Appeareance 
       Full-body image of Bakuro.     
 Bakuro is a short boy with green hair that usually hangs over his hazel eyes when he is being unassuming. He wears a long-sleeved white collared shirt with the sleeves rolled up to just below the elbow, burgundy pants with a salmon interior rolled up at the ankles, red suspenders, a lilac tie with dark diagonal lines, the  Newspaper Club 's yellow and black armband around his left bicep, and charcoal shoes with white soles.
 
 Personality 
 Bakuro generally remains in the shadows in comparison to his more exhuberant fellow  Newspaper Club  members, but when pushed is no less dramatic than them. He claims to report the truth, but in reality his version of the truth is heavily influenced by his own experiences; he publishes a piece criticizing  Rush Dueling  after studying the rules, yet apparently not Dueling himself, and later re-evaluates the truth after Rush Dueling  Luke . He initially believes Rush Dueling to be childish and simple, and as such is convinced of his own superiority when he Duels using the rules. When threatened with the notion of the Newspaper Club being shut down, Bakuro has a meltdown, screaming "Ceasing publication!" in shock. He claims to have difficulty remembering things. [1] 
 
 Etymology 
 Bakuro's full name in japanese order, "Shinjitsu Bakuro", literally translates to "reveal the truth".
