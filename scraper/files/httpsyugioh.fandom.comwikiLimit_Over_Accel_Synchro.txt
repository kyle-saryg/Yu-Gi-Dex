A  Limit Over Accel Synchro Summon  is a type of  Accel Synchro Summon  in the  Yu-Gi-Oh! 5D's  anime. It is the strongest known form of  Synchro Summon , and is the only way to Summon a  Limit Over Accel Synchro Monster .
 To perform such a Summon, the user must be in a state of  Over Top Clear Mind , and requires a minimum of one  Tuner Synchro Monster  and at least two non-Tuner Synchro Monsters to be used as  Synchro Material Monsters . This Summon uniquely depicts the  Tuner monster  transforming into gold Synchro rings rather than the standard green.
 Yusei Fudo  is the only person to have performed this Summon. He first learned about the existence of a type of Synchro Summon stronger than  Accel Synchro  when he saw  Bruno  use three Synchro Monsters to perform a  Delta Accel Synchro Summon  (instead of the usual two for an Accel Synchro Summon). [1]  Later, in his Duel against  Z-one , Yusei discovered how to exceed even Bruno's limits, and used a total of five Synchro Monsters (one Tuner and four non-Tuners) to Limit Over Accel Synchro Summon " Shooting Quasar Dragon ". [2] 
 
 Diagram 
 In the anime, " Life Stream Dragon " has an effect that can change the  Level  of other Synchro Monsters, which Yusei used to reduce the Level of " Red Dragon Archfiend ", " Black-Winged Dragon ", " Black Rose Dragon " and " Ancient Fairy Dragon " to 1.
 
 A Level 8  Tuner Synchro Monster  + A now Level 1 non-Tuner  Synchro Monster  + A now Level 1 non-Tuner Synchro Monster + A now Level 1 non-Tuner Synchro Monster + A now Level 1 non-Tuner Synchro Monster = A Level 12  Limit Over Accel Synchro Monster .
