 The effect of " Angel O7 " does not start a  Chain .  It is applied immediately after " Angel O7 " is successfully Tribute Summoned. [1] 
 While the effect of " Angel O7 " is active, the effects of " Sangan " and " Light and Darkness Dragon " do not activate at the specified times. [2] 
 " Angel O7 " only prevents effects which  activate  from activating.  It does not stop the Summoning of " Cyber Dragon " or " Swift Gaia the Fierce Knight ", because these do not  activate . [3] 
 Effects cannot be activated from any Zone.  The effect of " Sangan " will not activate.  The effect of " Thunder Dragon "/" Kuriboh "/etc cannot be activated. [4] 
 Continuous Effects  do not  activate , so " Angel O7 " will not prevent them from being applied. [5] 
 Previously Official Rulings 
   These TCG rulings were issued by  Upper Deck Entertainment  and have since been deemed unofficial by Konami. [6]  They were previously considered official and can still be correct, as long as they follow the official gameplay rules, or unless Konami has issued a ruling that says otherwise.

 " Angel O7 's" effect does not prevent a monster's  Continuous Effects  from being applied, because Continuous Effects never " activate ".
