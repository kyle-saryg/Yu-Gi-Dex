 Design 
 Appearance 
       "Aria" and " Sonata " in the anime.     
 "Melodious" monsters are female humanoids wearing flowing, regal clothing. They also feature various music-related objects on their bodies, such as musical notes or instruments factoring into their designs, such as the wings of " Mozarta the Melodious Maestra ". The "Melodious Choir" monsters also feature floral designs on their clothes, referring to  Zuzu Boyle 's bracelet motif. In addition, "Mozarta" and "Shopina" have butterfly wings/seats which represents the symbiotic relationship between butterflies and flowers.
 
 Etymology 
 The archetype's Japanese name, 幻奏  Gensō , is a blend of the words 幻想  gensō  "illusion" and 演奏  ensō  "musical performance". The titles of some of the monsters are plays on the words 音  oto  "sound" and 乙女  otome  "maiden" ("Diva") and 乙姫  otohime  "princess who is a younger sister" ("Maestra"). The pun for "Diva" cards has also been used for " Sonic Maid ", although her name is annotated with katakana instead of hiragana. 
 The "Melodious Diva" monsters are named after famous styles and themes of music, "Melodious Maestra" monsters are named after composers of classical music, and "Melodious Songstress" monsters are named after vocal ranges.

 Playing style 
 The "Melodious" archetype focuses on  Special Summoning  their low-Level Monsters, which aim to build a field of "Melodious" monsters that support each other to remain on the field. The majority of "Melodious" monsters have effects that Special Summon themselves or each other, such as " Sonata the Melodious Diva " or " Mozarta the Melodious Maestra ", or effects that apply if they were Special Summoned, like " Elegy the Melodious Diva ". " Shopina the Melodious Maestra " helps keep hand advantage to fuel Special Summoning "Melodious" monsters or optional tech cards like " Honest " and " Archlord Kristya ", and the Fusion Monsters aim to control the field. They also have massive Graveyard recovery power, as well as an ability to power up each other's ATK/DEF for offensive presence.
 As a turn one set-up, the main goal of this archetype is to Special Summon " Aria the Melodious Diva " and " Elegy the Melodious Diva " to protect your Special Summoned "Melodious" monsters from being targeted by card effects and from being destroyed by battle or card effects. 
 As a turn two set-up, the deck's main goal is to swarm the field with as many "Melodious" monsters as possible to perform an OTK as soon as possible. To reach this goal, " Mozarta the Melodious Maestra " is easily able to bring out other "Melodious" monsters from the hand to trigger their effects: for instance, " Soprano the Melodious Songstress " and " Tamtam the Melodious Diva " are the main Fusion Summoners of the deck. "Soprano" is able to recover a "Melodious" from the Graveyard upon being Special Summoned and can also Fusion Summon using itself and other monsters on the field as Fusion Materials, while "Tamtam" can constantly search and regenerate " Polymerization " upon being Special Summoned. " Sonata the Melodious Diva " easily Special Summons itself from the hand and increases  Fairy-Type  monsters ATK. As an OTK set-up, " Bloom Prima the Melodious Choir " powers up depending on the number of materials used to summon it and can attack twice, while " Bloom Diva the Melodious Choir " can run over most problematic boss monsters.
 The archetype's main Special Summoning effects are " 1st Movement Solo ", which can summon a low-Level "Melodious" monster from the hand or Main Deck, and " Ostinato ", which can Fusion Summon a "Melodious" using two Monsters from the  Main Deck  as Fusion Materials at the cost of the destruction of the summoned monsters during the  End Phase . "Ostinato" is objectively the most powerful card of the deck, as it can easily set-up any type of "Melodious" board: It can set-up an easy "Aria-Elegy" lock by summoning " Schuberta the Melodious Maestra ", easily summon " Bloom Diva the Melodious Choir " (that won't be destroyed during the End Phase due to its own effect) or " Bloom Prima the Melodious Choir " to establish a strong offensive play right of the bat and indirectly search any "Melodious" monster from the deck by sending it to the Graveyard as Fusion Material and then recover it once "Bloom Prima" is destroyed via its own effect. Alternatively, it's possible to use " Opera the Melodious Diva " as Fusion material to activate her effect and prevent the destruction of "Melodious" monsters during the turn. 
 With the release of " Bloom Harmonist the Melodious Composer ", in addition for an easy lock, Melodious is now capable of putting the higher level members of the Archetype on the field with ease, aiding them in Special Summoning through "Mozarta" and Graveyard Recycling through "Shopina", as well as having a practical access to their "Melodious Choir" monsters by Fusion Summoning through "Soprano" or adding "Polymerization" to your hand through "Tamtam". "Bloom Harmonist" also protect the monster(s) she points to by preventing your opponent from responding to "Bloom Diva" and "Bloom Prima"'s attack.

 Weaknesses 
 The "Melodious" monsters share the notion of Special Summoning as their pre-eminent means of strategy, which thus makes them the perfect target for anti-Special Summoning support like " Archlord Kristya ", " Aurora Paragon ", " Special Hurricane ", " Fossil Dyna Pachycephalo ", and " Jowgen the Spiritualist ", of which the latter three can also destroy such Summoned monsters without the protection of "Elegy"'s effect (though "Elegy" can protect itself from indiscriminate field destruction like " Raigeki Bottle ", " Black Rose Dragon " and " World of Prophecy " as long as she was Special Summoned). 
 Cards that can remove monsters from the field without targeting them and without destroying them can break through the protections "Aria" and "Elegy" provide, such as " Stellarknight Triverr ", " Madolche Queen Tiaramisu " and " Nekroz of Trishula ". Mass effect negation such as " Number 107: Galaxy-Eyes Tachyon Dragon ", " Skill Drain " or " Ice Beast Zerofyne " shuts down their defenses. " Eater of Millions " can cause "Melodious" issues due to their main way of dealing with monsters being through battle, and " Evenly Matched " can single-handedly dismantle a "Melodious" field as well. 
 Borreload Dragon  can easily steal "Aria" and then destroy "Elegy" by battle with its high attack. 
 Being a Link Monster, "Bloom Harmonist" cannot shift to defense position and thus susceptible to battle damage, unless the player also runs cards like " Spirit Barrier " and " The Sanctuary in the Sky ". She is also susceptible to " Ash Blossom & Joyous Spring ", though one can get around this by using "Bloom Prima" as one of the Link material, as this will create a chain block that prevent "Ash Blossom" from responding to "Bloom Prima"'s Special Summon effect.
