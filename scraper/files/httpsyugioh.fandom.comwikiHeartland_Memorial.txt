      The exterior of Heartland Memorial Hall.     
 Heartland Memorial Hall , known as  Heartland Memorial  in the Japanese version, is a building in  Heartland City  dedicated to  Mr. Heartland  after his "death". It was filled with busts and statues of Heartland himself. When Heartland returned from the  Barian World , he and the rest of the  Fearsome Four of the Dark Dueling World  used the memorial as their headquarters. It is shown to be abandoned, with several of the display cases being smashed open. When  Yuma Tsukumo 's  friends  arrived, they used them as bait to lure Yuma there. The building then became the site of a  Duel  pitting Yuma and  Trey  against  Erazor . [1]
