 In  episode 45 ,  Amnael  uses this card during his duel against  Jaden Yuki . He summons this card via " Tin Spell Circle ". " Elemental HERO Clayman " (whose ATK was 1100 due to it being equipped with " Mud Max ") then attacks this card, but Amnael uses the effect of " Elemental Absorber " to banish " The Rock Spirit " from his hand and nullify the attack. On Amnael's next turn, this card, " Alchemy Beast - Ekenas the Mercury ", and " Alchemy Beast - Moonface the Silver " attack directly via their own effects. Later " Elemental HERO Avian " attacks this card, but Amnael uses the effect of "Elemental Absorber" to banish " Garuda the Wind Spirit " from his hand nullify the attack. " Elemental HERO Burstinatrix " then attacks this card, but Amnael uses the effect of "Elemental Absorber" to banish " Spirit of Flames " from his hand and nullify the attack. Jaden then activates " Burst Return " to return "Clayman", "Avian", and " Elemental HERO Bubbleman " to his hand. He then activates " Burst Impact " to destroy all monsters on the field except "Burstinatrix" and inflict 300 damage to both players for each of their monsters that were destroyed. Since four of Amnael's monsters were destroyed, he takes 1200 damage. All of Amnael's monsters were then banished due to the effect of " Alchemic Kettle - Chaos Distill ". In  the next episode , this card is shown when Amnael was counting up the number of banished monsters for the effect of " Helios Duo Megistus ". After Jaden summons " Elemental HERO Electrum ", the latter's effect returns all banished monsters to their owners' Decks. 
 This card's attack is called  Sonic Burst  in the original and  Sonic Searer  in the dub.
