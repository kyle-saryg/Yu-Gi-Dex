 Summary 
 Bandit Keith  continues to watch the  Yugi  and  Kaiba   Duel  from a balcony. Yugi appears to have an advantage over Kaiba, until Kaiba unleashes his " Crush Card ", destroying all of Yugi's  monsters  with 1500 or more  ATK . On top of that, Kaiba draws all three " Blue-Eyes White Dragons " and " Polymerization ", allowing him to  fuse  them together,  forming  the " Blue-Eyes Ultimate Dragon ". The situation seems hopeless for Yugi, but encouragement from his friends and thoughts of his  grandpa  make him determined to carry on.

 Duel continues in the next episode . 
 
 Mistakes 
 In the dub version, " Crush Card " was given the green background of  Magic Cards . 
 In the Japanese version, " Mystical Elf " was shown instead of "Gift of the Mystical Elf" in  Kaiba 's hand. This was fixed in the dub version. 
 When Kaiba activates "Gift of the Mystical Elf", he simply calls it "Mystical Elf" in the dub version. In Japanese, its name is Holy Elf's Blessing, and Kaiba does say it right in the Japanese version. 
 "Battle Ox" has been seen in Kaiba's hand since the previous episode, and is even seen in his hand at the beginning of this episode. However, when Yugi plays "The Eye of Truth" to look at Kaiba's hand, "Battle Ox" is not among the cards shown to him. Instead, Yugi sees "De-Spell", which Kaiba has already used. 
 Yugi had re-summoned his Dark Magician at the end of the previous episode, but it is absent at the beginning of this episode before Yugi summons it again. 
 Differences in adaptations 
 " The Eye of Truth " and " Gift of the Mystical Elf " were redesigned as  Trap Cards  in the English dub in order to match their  TCG / OCG  counterparts. Both were  Spell Cards  in the Japanese version; as a result, gameplay errors occur as both cards were played without being Set first. 
 " Mystic Box " is given a slight redesign in the dub. 
 In the original, Yugi knew Kaiba was going to fuse his dragons, but in the dub he didn't. 
 In the original, Téa prays to the Goddess of Victory to help Yugi with the match, in the dub, she worries on Yugi.
