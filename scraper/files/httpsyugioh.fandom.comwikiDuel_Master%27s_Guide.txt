 Touted as an "Easy way to Learn Yu-Gi-Oh!", the Duel Master's Guide explains all the Yu-Gi-Oh! Trading Card Game Rules, and also gives great tips on basic deck building. The Yu-Gi-Oh Duel Master's Guide teaches you, step by step how to become a Yu-Gi-Oh! Master. The DVD also shows you sample duels, and it's arguably easier to understand than the printed rule book(s) when this was first released to retail. It even features the voices of  Joey Wheeler  and  Yugi Muto  ( Wayne Grayson  &  Dan Green  respectively) from the Yu-Gi-Oh! Second series anime.
