      Capsule Monster Chess     
 Capsule Monster Chess  (カプセル・モンスター・チェス  Kapuseru Monsutā Chesu ), often abbreviated to  CapMon   (カプモン  Kapumon ), is a board game from the  Yu-Gi-Oh!  manga  and  Toei anime . The video game  Yu-Gi-Oh! Monster Capsule: Breed and Battle  is based on it
 The game  Capsule Monsters  is based on this game.
 
 Anime and manga Appearances 
 Yugi  played it twice against  Mokuba  in Chapters  24  and  35 , both times Mokuba cheated by using a rigged dispenser to give him high Level monsters and give Yugi low Level ones.
 It appeared in the  first series anime  in episodes  11  and  23 . The first time  Miho Nosaka  was wooed by  Warashibe , who gave her CapMon as presents and eventualy played her. This game was based on the first manga game, it featured the rigged dispenser and used the same monsters from Yugi and Mokuba's first game. Dark Yugi stepped in to finish the game for Miho after finding out Warashibe had been cheating. It's second appearance was when Yugi played against Mokuba, which was based on their second manga game as it involved the same monsters.
 
 Rules 
 The rules were an altered version of  chess . The manga gave the rules as each player has five Capsule Monsters, each monster has a different Level, the player to destroy all their opponent's monsters wins. Although never stated to be rule, the monsters were always chosen at random. Levels ranged from 1 to 5.
 The game was setup by placing your monsters in a line on your side of a board divided into many squares. Monsters can move but it is unclear how many spaces they could move. Monsters could destroy lower Level monsters by moving into their squares. In the case of a tie of Levels both monsters are destroyed.
 Each monster had one or more abilities. However, the abilities were never fully explained, as they were only given bleak descriptions such as "Dig."
 Located in the corners were evolution squares. If you move a monster to an evolution square on your opponent's side of the board they evolve into a more powerful higher Level monster.
 A more thorough set of rules exists within the video game.
