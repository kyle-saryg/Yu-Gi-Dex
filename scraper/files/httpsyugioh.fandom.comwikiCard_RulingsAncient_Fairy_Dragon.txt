 The effect of " Ancient Fairy Dragon " which destroys the  Field Spell Card  does not  target . [2] 
 If the effect of " Ancient Fairy Dragon " does not destroy the Field Spell Card - such as if " Ancient City - Rainbow Ruins " has its " 1+ " effect active - then do not resolve the other effects of " Ancient Fairy Dragon ".  Do not add another Field Spell Card from your Deck to your hand, and do not gain 1000 Life Points. [3] 
 The effects " destroy a Field Spell Card " and " gain 1000 Life Points " of " Ancient Fairy Dragon " are considered to resolve simultaneously.  However, if you choose to resolve the " add 1 Field Spell Card to your hand " effect, then that occurs afterwards. [4] 
 Example: If " Geartown " is destroyed by the effect of " Ancient Fairy Dragon " and you choose not to add a  Field Spell Card  to your hand, then you can activate the effect of " Geartown ".  However, if you add a  Field Spell Card  to your hand, then you  miss the timing  and cannot activate the effect of " Geartown ". [4]
