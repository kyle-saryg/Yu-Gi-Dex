 Summary 
 The final  Duel  of the  Duelist Kingdom  finals continues between  Yugi Muto  and  Joey Wheeler . Yugi  Summons  " Dark Magician " and  activates  " Magical Hats ". He buys himself enough time to activate " Spellbinding Circle " on " Black Skull Dragon ", lowering its  ATK  to 2500 while activating " Book of Secret Arts " on "Dark Magician", giving it 300 more ATK and allowing it to  destroy  "Black Skull Dragon". Joey Summons " Baby Dragon " and  Sets  a card. Yugi, believing the Set card is " Time Wizard ",  attacks , but Joey activates " Kunai with Chain " to stop its attack. Joey then draws the "Time Wizard" and succeeds in its  effect , turning "Baby Dragon" into " Thousand Dragon " while turning "Dark Magician" into an old man with only 100 ATK.
 However, this actually turns "Dark Magician" into " Dark Sage ", which allows Yugi to activate " Makiu, the Magical Mist " in order to  negate  " Thousand Dragon 's" attack. Yugi then activates " Monster Reborn " to  Special Summon  "Black Skull Dragon". With both Duelists and  Téa  shedding tears, Yugi attacks, destroying "Thousand Dragon" and winning the Duel. Afterwards, Joey tries to give his "Glory of the King's Hand" to Yugi, but Yugi tells him to keep it since Joey needs the money more than he does and Yugi only came because he wanted to rescue his grandfather. With the Duel over, it's time for the ultimate showdown between Yugi and  Maximillion Pegasus .
 
 Featured Duel: Yami Yugi vs. Joey Wheeler 
 
 This Duel uses  Duelist Kingdom  gameplay. Rules and  card effects  may differ from that of the  TCG / OCG . See the individual card articles for more information.     
 Duel continues from the previous episode . 
 Yugi  has 550  LP  remaining and  controls  no cards. 
 Joey  has 750 LP remaining and controls " Black Skull Dragon " (3200/2500) in  Attack Position  and no  Set  cards.
 Turn 9: Yami Yugi 
Yugi  draws  " Dark Magician " and subsequently  Normal Summons  it (2500/2100) in Attack Position. He then  activates  " Magical Hats " to hide "Dark Magician" within one of four "Hats".
 Turn 10: Joey 
"Black Skull Dragon"  attacks  and  destroys  a "Hat", but it's empty. Joey Normal Summons " Garoozis " (1800/1500) in Attack Position, hoping to lure Yugi into attacking "Garoozis" with "Dark Magician", which would allow Joey to attack and destroy "Dark Magician" with "Black Skull Dragon" and win the Duel.
 Turn 11: Yami Yugi 
Yugi, not falling for the bluff, Sets a card into one of the three remaining "Hats".
 Turn 12: Joey 
"Black Skull Dragon" attacks and destroys a "Hat", but it's empty.
 Turn 13: Yami Yugi 
Yugi draws, then passes his turn.
 Turn 14: Joey 
Joey draws. "Black Skull Dragon" attacks and destroys a "Hat", but it's revealed to contain " Spellbinding Circle " which immediately activates, decreasing "Black Skull Dragon's"  ATK  by 700 and forbidding Joey from attacking with it or  changing  its  battle position  ("Black Skull Dragon": 3200 → 2500/2500). Joey switches "Garoozis" to  Defense Position .
 Turn 15: Yami Yugi 
Yugi draws " Book of Secret Arts " and subsequently activates it,  equipping  it to "Dark Magician" and increasing its ATK and  DEF  by 300 ("Dark Magician": 2500 → 2800/2100 → 2400). "Dark Magician" attacks and destroys "Black Skull Dragon" (Joey: 750 → 450 LP).
 Turn 16: Joey 
Joey draws " Baby Dragon " and subsequently Normal Summons it (1200/700) in Attack Position. He then Sets a card.
 Turn 17: Yami Yugi 
"Dark Magician" attacks "Baby Dragon", but Joey activates his face-down " Kunai with Chain " to  negate  the attack and forbid "Dark Magician" from changing its battle position, as well as equip "Kunai with Chain" to "Garoozis" and increase its ATK by 500 ("Garoozis": 1800 → 2300/1500).
 Turn 18: Joey 
Joey draws " Time Wizard " and subsequently Normal Summons it (500/400) in Attack Position. He then activates the  effect  of "Time Wizard" and succeeds in the effect, so "Baby Dragon" transforms into " Thousand Dragon " (2400/2000) in Attack Position and "Dark Magician" transforms into " Dark Sage " (100/?) in Attack Position. "Thousand Dragon" attacks "Dark Sage", but Yugi uses the effect of "Dark Sage" to activate " Makiu, the Magical Mist " from his hand and negate the attack.
 Turn 19: Yami Yugi 
Yugi activates the effect of "Dark Sage" to add " Monster Reborn " to his hand instead of conducting his  Draw Phase . Yugi activates "Monster Reborn" to  Special Summon  " Black Skull Dragon " (3200/2500) from Joey's  Graveyard  to his side of the  field  in Attack Position. "Black Skull Dragon" attacks and destroys "Thousand Dragon" (Joey: 450 → 0 LP).
 
 Differences in adaptations 
 The  Cecelia  flashback is added in the dub when  Pegasus  thinks back about himself and her. 
 Also added is a shot of  Joey  just before the US commercial break. 
 Mistakes 
 On one shot of the field, in both versions, " Garoozis " is missing on  Joey 's side of the field. 
 In the US version, when  Joey  Summons " Time Wizard ", where it displays his cards, " Black Skull Dragon " is shown instead of " Baby Dragon ". 
 In both versions, Yami Yugi claims he adds "Monster Reborn" to his hand using "Dark Sage's" effect. However, he is shown drawing it during his  Draw Phase  at the beginning of his turn. 
 Trivia 
 Yugi's last attack is symbolic due to him using the monster made of his and Joey's combined monsters, which Joey had used to take the lead in the Duel and show how far he'd come and due to the fact that the monster destroyed, " Thousand Dragon ", was the monster Joey used to win his first  Duelist Kingdom  match with. Also,  Time Wizard  was used to summon Thousand Dragon, which Yugi gave to Joey in  episode 3 . 
 In the English dub, Joey is worried when Yugi plays " Magical Hats ", stating that now he will have to rely "on luck and not dueling skills."  Ironically, one of Joey's best cards, " Time Wizard ", is a card that relies on luck, and in subsequent seasons, Joey's deck would include more cards with similar effects, such as " Graceful Dice " and " Skull Dice ". 
 Ironically, despite being the creator of duel monsters and holder of the  Millennium Eye , even Pegasus did not see the counter effect of Yugi's  Dark Sage  coming.
