 Summary 
 Featured Duel: Yami Yugi vs. Mako Tsunami 
 
 This Duel uses  Duelist Kingdom  gameplay. Rules and  card effects  may differ from that of the  TCG / OCG . See the individual card articles for more information.     
 Monsters  compatible with  Ocean  or  Desert  receive a 30%  Field Power Bonus . This includes  Aqua ,  Dinosaur ,  Fish ,  Rock ,  Sea Serpent ,  Thunder  and  Zombie - Type  monsters.
 Turn 1: Mako 
 Mako   Normal Summons  " Fiend Kraken " (1200 → 1560/1400 → 1820) in  Attack Position . "Fiend Kraken" then hides underneath the sea area of the  Dueling Arena .
 Turn 2: Yami Yugi 
 Yugi  Normal Summons " Horn Imp " (1300/1000) in Attack Position.
 Turn 3: Mako 
"Fiend Kraken"  attacks  and  destroys  "Horn Imp" (Yugi: 2000 → 1740  LP ).
 Turn 4: Yami Yugi 
Yugi draws. He then Normal Summons " Feral Imp " (1300/1400) in  Defense Position .
 Turn 5: Mako 
Mako draws. He then  Sets  " Jellyfish ".
 Turn 6: Yami Yugi 
Yugi draws. He then activates " Horn of the Unicorn ",  equipping  it to "Feral Imp" and increasing its  ATK  and  DEF  by 700 ("Feral Imp": 1300 → 2000/1400 → 2100). Yugi then  switches  "Feral Imp" into Attack Position. "Feral Imp" attacks Mako's Set "Jellyfish" (1200 → 1560/1500 → 1950). Due to the effect of "Jellyfish", it is not destroyed as it can absorb electrical attacks. 
 Turn 7: Mako 
"Fiend Kraken" attacks "Feral Imp". Because "Feral Imp" is battling a monster with a Field Power Bonus, the effect of "Horn of the Unicorn" is  negated  ("Feral Imp": 2000 → 1300/2100 → 1400). "Fiend Kraken" destroys "Feral Imp" (Yugi: 1740 → 1480 LP).
 Turn 8: Yami Yugi 
Yugi draws. He then Normal Summons  " Silver Fang " (1200/800) in Defense Position. He then activates " Full Moon ", increasing the ATK and DEF of "Silver Fang" by 300 ("Silver Fang" 1200 → 1500/800 → 1100). 
 Turn 9: Mako 
Mako draws. He then Normal Summons " Kairyu-Shin " (1800 → 2340/1500 → 1950) in Attack Position. "Kairyu-Shin" attacks and destroys "Silver Fang". A tidal wave occurs during the attack, reducing the Desert part of the  field  to 5%.  
 Turn 10: Yami Yugi 
Yugi draws. He then Normal Summons " Giant Soldier of Stone " (1300 → 1690/2000 → 2600)  in Defense Position.
 Turn 11: Mako 
Mako draws. He then Normal Summons " Great White Terror " (1500 → 1950/1200 → 1560) in Attack Position. Mako's monsters surround "Giant Soldier of Stone".
 Turn 12: Yami Yugi 
Yugi draws. He then switches "Giant Soldier of Stone" to Attack Position. "Giant Soldier of Stone"  attacks "Full Moon" , causing the tide to reverse and the water to recede ("Fiend Kraken": 1560 → 1200/1820 → 1400, "Jellyfish": 1560 → 1200/1950 → 1500, "Kairyu-Shin": 2340 → 1800/1950 → 1500, "Great White Terror": 1950 → 1500/1560 → 1200). Yugi then Normal Summons " Curse of Dragon " (2000/1500) in Attack Position. He then activates " Burning Land " to allow "Curse of Dragon" to attack all monsters Mako controls once each. "Curse of Dragon" then attacks and destroys all of Mako's monsters (Mako: 2000 → 0 LP).
