 Summary 
 Bastion Misawa  is awed by  Chazz Princeton 's Summoning of " Light and Darkness Dragon ", remembering the card from when Chazz won junior tournaments in the past. Chazz declares that no matter how strong Bastion gets, Chazz will get always be stronger. Chazz attacks " Shutendoji " with "Light and Darkness Dragon", reducing Bastion to 1400  Life Points . Bastion  activates  the  effect  of the " Mezuki " in his  Graveyard ,  removing  it from play to  Special Summon  " Crow Tengu " from his Graveyard. The effect of "Light and Darkness Dragon" activates,  negating  the effect automatically, while reducing both its attack and defense points by 500 in the process. Bastion aims to keep triggering the effect so that his " Nine-Tailed Fox " can destroy it. He activates " Spirits Rest ", which would Special Summon one  Yokai  monster from his Graveyard. Chazz activates his  face-down  " Dragon Gust " which would negate that effect, but "Light and Darkness Dragon's" effect activates, negating both cards, and reducing its attack and defense to 1300 and 800, respectively.
 Bastion Summons " Ittan Momen " in  Attack Position , and Chazz activates his face-down " Final Attack Orders ", which he again negates with "Light and Darkness Dragon", decreasing its stats further. As its defense is no only 300, Chazz can no longer activate the effect. Bastion is worried about Chazz's last face-down cards, speculating that it's not a card to  revive  a  Dragon , as it would have been pointless to drop "Light and Darkness Dragon's" points so far. He concludes it must be card that negates attacks or destroys attacking monsters. He chooses to attack with "Ittan Momen".
 David Rabb  wanders the island, musing of the location of the spirit cards he seeks. He believes there is at least one on the island, due to  Syrus Truesdale 's hesitant response to his question. He briefly glimpses the  spirit  of "Light and Darkness Dragon", and rushes towards it. At the Duel, Chazz reveals his final face-down card - " Cleansing Water ", which returns the stats of "Light and Darkness Dragon" to their  original values . "Light and Darkness Dragon" destroys "Ittan Momen", and Chazz defeats Bastion, who declares that he'll still make it to the finals, and defeat both Chazz and  Jaden Yuki  there. Chazz counters that he'll beat Bastion at his own game.
 Reggie MacKenzie  runs into  Alexis Rhodes  on the beach, asking if she's  Atticus' sister , and calls him by his self-given nickname (Fubuking in the Japanese version, Rhodie in the English version). Reggie challenges Alexis, and she agrees, with Reggie commenting that she has a drive to Duel, unlike her brother. Alexis is embarrassed by Reggie's constant use of her brother's nickname, and asks her to stop. She responds that she will if Alexis wins. David has reached the spot where he thought he saw the spirit, but finds the spot empty. He remarks that he's now confirmed his suspicions, but that he's in no hurry. Back at the Duel, Reggie has just Summoned " The Splendid Venus ", shocking Alexis.

 Chazz's turn

Chazz  Sets  three cards.
 Bastion's turn 
Bastion activates " Spirits Rest " to send a  Yokai - Type   monster  he  controls  to his Graveyard, but Chazz activates his  face-down  " Dragon Gust ", which would negate the effect, but "Light and Darkness Dragon" negates both effects, and its ATK and DEF lower by 1000, to 1300 and 900, respectively [Notes 1] . Bastion  Normal Summons  " Ittan Momen " (1200/1500) in  Attack Position .

 Notes 
 
 ↑   In the  TCG / OCG , "Light and Darkness Dragon's" effect can only be activated once per  Chain , and must be activated to negate the effect of a card which activates. Therefore, "Dragon Gust" would  miss the timing .
