 Duel Monsters Dice Game 
 Inside the book was a dice game. The game could be played by one or more players. Each player starts with 2000  Life Points . They advance to different squares, depending on the numbers they roll. Each square contains a monster, that would either raise or lower their Life Points by a specified amount. The player loses if they run out of Life Points or land on one of  Kaiba's  special traps.
 To win the game, the player must get to the Kaiba Stage, which featured a " Blue-Eyes White Dragon " with 3000 Life Points. If their Life Points was higher, the player could proceed to the goal, where they are assigned a ranking based on the amount of Life Points they have. Players compare scores to see who got the highest.
