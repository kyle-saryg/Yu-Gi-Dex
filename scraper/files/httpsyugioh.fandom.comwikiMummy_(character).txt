      The group of mummies that serves Anubis.     
 Mummies  appear throughout the different  Yu-Gi-Oh!  series. Two different sets appear; one serves as a group of servants to  Anubis  in  Yu-Gi-Oh! The Movie: Pyramid of Light . The other group serves  Abidos the Third .
 In both of their appearances, mummies serve as basically grunts, accomplishing little other than providing a distraction.
 
 Pyramid of Light 
 When  Yugi Muto ,  TÃ©a Gardner ,  Joey Wheeler  and  Tristan Taylor  have their souls sucked into the  Pyramid of Light , a group of mummies controlled by  Anubis  attacks the group. These mummies are defeated when Yugi figured out the use of a dagger that was sealed in a room within the Pyramid. Yugi throws the dagger at an engraving of the  Millennium Eye  within the room, destroying the pyramid once and for all.
 
 Yu-Gi-Oh! GX 
 A separate group of mummies appear as servants to one of the seven  Shadow Riders ,  Abidos the Third . The mummified remains of his Egyptian servants, they awaken him when the time comes for him to challenge  Jaden Yuki , and pilot his vessel. A group of stereotypical mummies under Abidos' command ambushes Jaden,  Alexis Rhodes   Chazz Princeton ,  Professor Banner ,  Syrus Truesdale , and  Zane Truesdale , who are brought aboard the ship. When Jaden defeats Abidos, they return to the spirit world with him.
 It is revealed through flashbacks that his servants, when they were alive, intentionally lost their Duels against Prince Abidos, causing him to be known as an unbeatable duelist.
