 Biography 
 Yami Bakura initially appeared in Duel Links during the event " Fear the Deck of Terror! The Destiny Board of Doom. "
 Upon arrival, he stated he only arrived to keep an eye on Yami Yugi. Upon being confronted by the latter, Yami Bakura stated he wasn't planning anything and simply wanted to not be forgotten.
 When he encountered  Seto Kaiba , Yami Bakura referred to him as "the game master" before stating he knows his place in Duel Links as an NPC. Kaiba neither confirmed or denied if Yami Bakura truly was one.
 By the time the event ended, Yami Bakura disappeared while claiming that he "might ressurect some day."

 Trivia 
 For reasons unknown, Yami Bakura's eyes are colored red, instead of brown like in the anime. 
 Additional card dialogue was added with the " The Shadow Memories: Bakura " event. 
 The inclusion of " Dark Master - Zorc " as card-specific dialogue is a reference to the  Monster World  game from the manga. 
 Previously, upon being defeated in a Duel, Yami Bakura's sprite would show him with a triumphant grin, while his sprite when he is the victor shows him taken aback. This may have been an oversight on the part of the programmers. 
 In the voice lines found in the game files, Yami Bakura labels " Dimensional Fissure " as a Trap Card when in the actuality, it is a Spell Card.
