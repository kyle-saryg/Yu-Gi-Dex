 " The Chosen One ", known as " Dreaming Roboppi " in the Japanese version, is the one-hundredth-and-fourteenth episode of  Yu-Gi-Oh! VRAINS  anime. It aired in Japan on August 14, 2019. It aired in English on 9Go! on September 3, 2021.
 Roboppi  uses ever-changing tactics to drive  Soulburner  into a corner. Unfazed by the  Appliancer  monsters' fierce attacks, Soulburner launches a counterattack against Roboppi. As the intense back-and-forth battle between the two rages on, something abnormal happens to Roboppi!
 
 Featured Duel: Soulburner vs. Roboppi 
 Duel continues from the previous episode . 
 Turn 4: Soulburner 
Soulburner Normal Summons " Salamangreat Falco " (1200/1600). As he controls a "Salamangreat" monster besides " Salamangreat Spinny " and "Salamangreat Spinny" is in his GY, Soulburner activates the effect of "Salamangreat Spinny", Special Summoning it (1000/1500) in Defense Position. Soulburner uses "Salamangreat Falco" and "Salamangreat Spinny" to Link Summon " Salamangreat Sunlight Wolf " to the Extra Monster Zone.
 Since "Salamangreat Falco" was sent to the GY, Soulburner activates its effect, allowing Soulburner to target a Spell/Trap Card in his GY and Set it on his field. He Sets "Salamangreat Claw". Soulburner then activates the effect of the "Salamangreat Jack Jaguar" in his Graveyard to return " Salamangreat Heatleo " from his Graveyard to his Extra Deck and Special Summon it (1500/1000) from his Graveyard to a zone "Sunlight Wolf" points to. Since a "Salamangreat" monster was Special Summoned to a zone "Sunlight Wolf" points to, Soulburner activates its effect, allowing him to add "Salamangreat Falco" from his Graveyard to his hand. Soulburner then uses "Jack Jaguar" to Link Summon " Salamangreat Balelynx ". Since "Balelynx" was Link Summoned, Soulburner activates its effect, allowing him to add "Salamangreat Sanctuary" from his Deck to his hand. Soulburner uses "Sunlight Wolf" and "Balelynx" to Link Summon "Salamangreat Heatleo".
 As "Heatleo" was Link Summoned, Soulburner activates its effect, shuffling a card in Roboppi's Spell & Trap Zone to his Deck. He targets one of Roboppi's Set cards. He then uses "Heatleo" to Reincarnation Link Summon his remaining "Heatleo" to the Extra Monster Zone. As "Heatleo" was Link Summoned, Soulburner activates its effect, shuffling a card in Roboppi's Spell & Trap Zone to his Deck. He targets Roboppi's remaining set card. Soulburner then equips "Heatleo" with "Salamangreat Claw". Since "Claw" is equipped to a Reincarnation Link Summoned monster, it can attack a number of times equal to its Link Rating. "Heatleo" attacks "Appliancer Laundry Dragon", but Roboppi activates the effect of "Appliancer Electrilyrical World" to move "Appliancer Laundry Dragon" to a zone "Appliancer Cellopus" points to. As a Link Monster co-linked to "Appliancer Celtopus" is battling, the battling monster gains 1000 ATK for every monster co-linked to "Celtopus" during damage calculation only ("Laundry Dragon": 1500 → 2500 ATK). Since "Laundry Dragon" battles while co-linked, its effect reduces all Battle Damage to 0 and banishes the opponent's monster after damage calculation. The attack continues, Soulburner takes no Battle Damage and "Heatleo" is banished.
 Since a "Salamangreat" Link Monster was removed from the field by a card effect, Soulburner activates the effect of the "Salamangreat" monster in his Graveyard, allowing him to Special Summon it from his GY and 1 Level 4 or lower monster from his GY with its effects negated. Soulburner Special Summons "Zebroid X" (1500/1000) and "Salamangreat Jack Jaguar" (1500/1000) from his Graveyard in Attack Position. After that happens, Soulburner must overlay those two monsters for an Xyz Summon via the effect of "Zebroid X". Soulburner overlays "Zebroid X" and "Jack Jaguar" to Xyz Summon " Salamangreat Blaze Dragon " (2300/1200) in Attack Position. Due to the second effect of "Zebroid X", "Blaze Dragon" gains 300 ATK for every Overlay Unit it has ("Blaze Dragon": 2300 → 2900/1200).
 "Blaze Dragon" attacks "Laundry Dragon". Soulburner activates the Quick-Play Spell Card "Salamangreat Tail" to target one "Salamangreat" monster he controls, increase its ATK by its DEF and increase his LP by the same amount. He targets "Blaze Dragon" ("Blaze Dragon": 2900 → 4100/1200; Soulburner: 800 → 2000 LP). As a Link Monster co-linked to "Appliancer Celtopus" is battling, the battling monster gains 1000 ATK for every monster co-linked to "Celtopus" during damage calculation only ("Laundry Dragon": 1500 → 2500 ATK). Roboppi activates the effect of the "Appliancer Reduce" in his GY, banishing it to halve all Battle Damage he takes. The attack continues and "Laundry Dragon" is destroyed (Roboppi: 1000 → 200 LP). Soulburner sets 1 card.
 Turn 5: Roboppi 
Roboppi activates "Appliancer Test", allowing him to Special Summon monsters from his Graveyard so that they are co-linked with an "Appliancer" Link Monster he controls, but the Special Summoned monsters will have their ATKs reduced to 0. He Special Summons "Vacculephant" (1000 → 0 ATK) and "Propelion" (1200 → 0 ATK) to the zones "Cellopus" points to. As "Vacculephant" is co-linked, its effect lets Roboppi target and destroy 1 monster in the opponent's Main Monster Zone. He targets "Blaze Dragon", but Soulburner activates the effect of "Blaze Dragon" to detach an Overlay Unit and negate its destruction ("Blaze Dragon": 2900 → 2600/1200).
 Roboppi uses "Vacculephant" to Link Summon "Laundry Dragon". The effect of "Electrilyrical World" activates, allowing Roboppi to return "Appliancer Copybokkle" from his Graveyard to his hand. He then uses "Proplelion" to Link Summon "Appliancer Dryer Drake" (0/LINK-1/↗). Since "Dryer Drake" is co-linked, its effect increases its ATK by 1000 ("Dryer Drake": 0 → 1000 ATK). "Laundry Dragon" attacks "Blaze Dragon". As a Link Monster co-linked to "Appliancer Celtopus" is battling, the battling monster gains 1000 ATK for every monster co-linked to "Celtopus" during damage calculation only ("Laundry Dragon": 1500 → 3500 ATK). Soulburner sends "Salamangreat Sanctuary" fron his hand to the GY to activate the Continuous Trap Card "Salamangreat Ring", which makes all "Salamangreat" monsters Soulburner controls immune to card effects and increases the ATK of all "Salamangreat" monster he controls by 500 ("Blaze Dragon": 2600 → 3100 ATK).
 Soulburner activates the effect of "Blaze Dragon", detaching an Overlay Unit to negate his monster's destruction by battle (Soulburner: 2000 → 1600 LP; "Blaze Dragon": 3100 → 2800 ATK). "Dryer Drake" attacks "Blaze Dragon". As a Link Monster co-linked to "Appliancer Celtopus" is battling, the battling monster gains 1000 ATK for every monster co-linked to "Celtopus" during damage calculation only ("Dryer Drake": 1000 → 3000 ATK). Since "Blaze Dragon" has no Overlay Units and is being attacked, Soulburner activates its effect, overlaying it to Reincarnation Xyz Summon another "Blaze Dragon" (2300 → 2800 ATK) in Attack Position. Since "Blaze Dragon" was Reincarnation Xyz Summoned, Soulburner activates its effect, allowing him to destroy "Laundry Dragon".
 Since an "Appliancer" Link Monster was destroyed by a card effect, Roboppi activates the second effect of the "Appliancer Coating" in his GY, banishing it to Special Summon the destroyed monster and banish 1 Link Monster from Soulburner's GY. He Special Summons "Laundry Dragon" co-linked to "Cellopus" and banishes "Balelynx". A replay occurs and "Dryer Drake" attacks "Blaze Dragon". The effect of "Cellopus" activates ("Dryer Drake": 1000 → 3000 ATK). Soulburner activates the effect of "Blaze Dragon" to detach an Overlay Unit and negate its destruction (Soulburner: 1600 → 1400 LP). "Laundry Dragon" attacks "Blaze Dragon". The effect of "Cellopus" activates ("Laundry Dragon": 1500 → 3500 ATK). "Laundry Dragon" destroys "Blaze Dragon" (Soulburner: 1400 → 700 LP). Since "Dryer Drake" is co-linked, Roboppi activates its effect, switching locations with "Laundry Dragon" to allow "Laundry Dragon" to attack twice. At this point, Roboppi chooses not to attack and ends his turn.
 Turn 6: Soulburner 
Since Soulburner controls no monsters, he activates the Equip Spell "Rising Fire", Special Summoning "Heatleo" from his Graveyard and equipping it with "Rising Fire". "Heatleo" attacks and destroys "Dryer Drake" (Roboppi: 200 → 0).
