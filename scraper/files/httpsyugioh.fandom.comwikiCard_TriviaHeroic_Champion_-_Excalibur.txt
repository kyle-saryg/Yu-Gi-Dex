 This monster is the  cover card  for  Return of the Duelist . 
 This monster is based on  Excalibur ,  King Arthur 's mystical sword. 
 This monster was  Nistro 's  signature card  before he gave it to  Yuma Tsukumo . 
 This card's effect is similar to that of " Excalibur ", which also shares this card's name. 
 The hilt of this monster's sword is shaped like a bird, particularly the  phoenix . 
 In the English dub, the music used for a " Number " monster being Summoned was used for the Summoning of this card in  episode 45 . 
 This monster appears in the artworks of " Heroic Chance ", " Heroic Change ", " Heroic Growth ", " Xyz Pieces " and " Xyz Shift ". 
 This card can be seen as a counterpart to " Number 86: Heroic Champion - Rhongomyniad ".
 Both are named after weapons wielded by the legendary King Arthur; Excalibur being his sword and Rhongomyniad his spear. 
 This monster is  LIGHT , while "Rhongomyniad" is  DARK . 
 The  ATK  of "Rhongomyniad" is lower than this card's by only 500 points and both have an effect to double their original ATK.
