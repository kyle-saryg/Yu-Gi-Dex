 Alba Litora  is the location where series 1 of  Yu-Gi-Oh! BAM  is set.
 
 Several millennia ago the isle of Alba Litora was devastated by a great and deadly battle, leaving little but memories of previous duels in its wake. 
 It is in this bleak and dreary place that you live and that your Yu-Gi-Oh! BAM adventure begins. 
As you wander the streets of Alba Litora you meet the legendary Yugi Muto, a long-time BAM player who quickly becomes a close friend and tells you about the ultimate BAM dueling tournament. Deciding to train together, you search for a place to practice and Yugi begins to tutor you in the game basics...
