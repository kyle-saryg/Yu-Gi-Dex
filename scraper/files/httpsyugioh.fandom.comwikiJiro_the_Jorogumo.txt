 Biography 
 Jiro the Jorogumo was an escaped convict and master of disguise. He worked as manager at  Burger World  at the time  Hiroto Honda ,  Miho Nosaka  and  Anzu Mazaki  were working there. He disguised himself as  Tetsuo Sasaki , another criminal, while committing several robberies. [1] 
 Eventually Jiro was exposed and he pointed a gun, which he stole from Sasaki, at Anzu, taking her hostage, blindfolding her. He ordered  Yugi Mutou  to get him some things, including a cigarette, a glass and a bottle of vodka. As he poured the alcohol, he reacted rather angrily when he heard Anzu calling for Yugi. Grief-stricken by Anzu's fate,  Dark Yugi  emerged, challenging Jiro to a Shadow Game. In  this game, each player was only allowed to move one finger of their own choice, otherwise the player would lose. Dark Yugi chose his thumb, while Jiro chose the finger presently on the trigger. Just before Jiro could pull it, Dark Yugi turned on a lighter, lighting the convicts cigarette. Originally, Jiro mistook it as a friendly gesture, but then Dark Yugi placed the still active lighter on his hand, now realizing, the vodka was still pouring, now onto Jiro's lap. Due to the high alcohol content of the vodka and the recoil of the gun, Jiro would easily be covered in powerful flames. Jiro disarmed and turned off the lighter. Dark Yugi put a  Penalty Game  on him because he moved more than one finger, causing the criminal to believe he was set on fire. [1]
