 Qualifiers 
 In order to enter the tournament, a member of the Dueling Team shall  Duel   Gauche , a member of the committee, and if he judges the team worthy, then it can take part in the tournament. [1] 
 
 Preliminaries 
       The system of Duels.     
 The tournament works in a similar way to the  World Duel Carnival ; the Duels are decided by the teams, who challenge who they want to. The Duels are 1-on-1 battles among the team. For example: in a Team A vs. Team B match, three Duels will happen: 1A vs. 1B, 2A vs. 2B and 3A vs. 3B. The team who obtains 2 wins is declared the winner of the match, and obtains a  Digital Stone  into their  D-Pads . If a team obtains 8 Digital Stones, it advances to the finals.
 Participants can check the rules by consulting the  D-Network  through their D-Pads. [2] 
 
 History 
 Team ZEXAL  takes part on the tournament.  Yuma   Duels  against  Gauche  in order for his team to participate, and wins. [1] 
In the first round, Team ZEXAL faces  Team Fire Stars . The first Duel is Yuma Tsukumo vs.  Shota Geki , which ends with Yuma's win.  Tetsuo  grants a second win for Team ZEXAL, while  Takashi  loses his match. With 2 wins, Team ZEXAL is the winner, and obtains their first Digital Stone. [3] 
 Team ZEXAL's second match takes place in the  Heartland Theme Park  Horror Tower. There, they face  Team lswarm . [4] 
 Team Shark  is revealed to be the first team to advance to the finals. At that time, Team ZEXAL and  Team Air Force  were the only participating teams who currently had a total of 7 Digital Stones, with only 1 remaining so that they could go to the finals. Because of that, they face each other, to decide which of them would advance. [5]
