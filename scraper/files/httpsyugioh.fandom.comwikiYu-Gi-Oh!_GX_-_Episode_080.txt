 Featured Duel: Jaden Yuki vs. Alice 
 Turn 1: Alice 
Alice draws " Alice the Wandering Doll " and subsequently Normal Summons it (300/1000) in  Defense Position . She then Sets two cards. Alice then activates " Cursed Dollhouse ". Now if "Alice the Wandering Doll" switches control from Alice to Jaden, Alice can  Special Summon  a " Doll Part " monster from her  Deck .
 Turn 2: Jaden 
Jaden draws " Elemental Hero Burstinatrix " and subsequently Normal Summons it (1200/800) in  Attack Position . "Burstinatrix" attacks "Alice the Wandering Doll". Due to the effect of "Alice the Wandering Doll", it is not destroyed. Since "Alice the Wandering Doll" was selected as an attack target, its effect activates, inflicting 500 damage to Jaden (Jaden 4000 → 3500) and giving control of "Alice the Wandering Doll" to Jaden at the end of the Damage Step. Since Jaden took control of "Alice the Wandering Doll", the effect of " Cursed Dollhouse " activates, allowing Alice to  Special Summon  " Doll Part Blue " (0/0) from her  Deck  in Attack Position.
 Turn 3: Alice 
Alice draws " Doll Part Gold " and subsequently Normal Summons it (0/0) in  Attack Position . "Doll Part Gold" then attacks "Burstinatrix". "Burstinatrix" destroys "Doll Part Gold" (Alice 4000 →  2800). Alice then activates her face-down " Necro Dollmeister " to  Special Summon  " Doll Part Red " and " Doll Part Pink " (0/0 each) from her Deck in Defense Position. She then activates her face-down " Soul Resurrection " to  Special Summon  "Doll Part Gold" from her Graveyard (0/0) in Defense Position. 
 " Doll Part Blue " attacks " Alice the Wandering Doll ". The attack fails (Alice 2800 → 1800). The effect of "Alice the Wandering Doll" then activates (Alice 1800 → 1300) and control of "Alice the Wandering Doll" is given to Alice. 
 Alice's hand contains " Dark Factory of Mass Production " and "Marionette Burial". Alice then activates " Marionette Burial " to send "Doll Part Blue", "Doll Part Pink", "Doll Part Gold", and "Doll Part Red" from her field to her Graveyard in order to  Special Summon  " Doll Chimera " (0/0) in Attack Position. Since "Doll Part Gold" has been removed from the field, "Soul Resurrection" is destroyed. Due to the effect of " Doll Chimera ", it gains 400  ATK  for every "Doll Part" card in Alice's Graveyard. There are currently four ("Doll Chimera": 0 → 1600/0).
 Turn 4: Jaden 
Jaden draws " Rallis the Star Bird " and subsequently Normal Summons it (800/800) in  Attack Position . "Rallis" attacks "Doll Chimera". Due to the effect of "Rallis", it gains ATK equal to the Level of "Doll Chimera" times 200. "Doll Chimera" is a  Level 5  monster ("Rallis the Star Bird": 800 → 1800/800). "Rallis the Star Bird" destroys "Doll Chimera" (Alice 1300 → 1100). 
 At the end of the  Damage Step , "Rallis the Star Bird" is  removed from play  until Jaden's next Battle Phase. Since "Doll Chimera" was destroyed and sent to the Graveyard, Alice activates its effect, sending two " Doll Part " cards ("Doll Part Blue" and "Doll Part Pink") from her Deck to the Graveyard in order to  Special Summon  "Doll Chimera" from her Graveyard (0 → 2400/0) in Attack Position. Jaden then switches "Burstinatrix" to  Defense Position .
 Turn 5: Alice 
Alice draws " Doll Hammer " and subsequently activates it to destroy " Doll Chimera ", draw two cards, and switch "Burstinatrix" to  Attack Position . Since "Doll Chimera" was destroyed and sent to the Graveyard, Alice activates its effect, sending two " Doll Part " cards ("Doll Part Red" and "Doll Part Gold") from her Deck to the Graveyard in order to  Special Summon  "Doll Chimera" from her Graveyard (0 → 3200/0) in Attack Position. "Doll Chimera" attacks and destroys "Burstinatrix" (Jaden 3500 → 1500). Alice then Sets a card.
 Turn 6: Jaden 
Jaden draws " Spy Hero ". He then Normal Summons " Elemental Hero Bubbleman " (800/1200) in  Attack Position . Since "Bubbleman" was summoned while Jaden had no other cards on his side of the field, its effect activates, allowing Jaden to draw two cards (" Bubble Blaster " and " Pot of Greed "). Jaden then activates "Pot of Greed" to draw two more cards (" Metamorphosis " and " Elemental Hero Sparkman "). Jaden's hand contains "Spy Hero", " Fusion Recovery ", "Battle By 2", " Elemental Hero Clayman ", "Polymerization", "Bubble Blaster", "Metamorphosis" and "Sparkman". Jaden then activates " Polymerization " to fuse "Sparkman" with "Clayman" and Fusion Summon " Elemental Hero Thunder Giant " (2400/1500) in Attack Position. 
 Since "Thunder Giant" was  Fusion Summoned , its effect activates, allowing Jaden to destroy "Doll Chimera" (as its  original ATK  was 0). [Notes 1]  Alice activates the effect of " Doll Chimera ", sending "Doll Part Pink" and "Doll Part Blue" from her Deck to the Graveyard to revive "Doll Chimera" (0 → 4000/0) in Attack Position. Jaden then activates "Metamorphosis" to Tribute "Elemental Hero Bubbleman" and  Special Summon  " Elemental Hero Neo Bubbleman " (800/1200) in Attack Position. Jaden then activates "Bubble Blaster", equipping it to "Neo Bubbleman" and increasing its ATK by 800 ("Neo Bubbleman": 800 → 1600/1200). 
 Jaden enters his Battle Phase. Due to the effect of "Rallis the Star Bird", it is returned to the field (800/800) in Attack Position. "Neo Bubbleman" attacks "Doll Chimera". Jaden destroys "Bubble Blaster" via its second effect to prevent "Neo Bubbleman" from being destroyed as well as reduce the Battle Damage he would take to 0. At the end of the Damage Step, the second effect of "Neo Bubbleman" activates, destroying "Doll Chimera" at the end of the  Damage Step . Alice activates the effect of "Doll Chimera", sending "Doll Part Red" and "Doll Part Gold" from her Deck to the Graveyard to revive "Doll Chimera" (0 → 4800/0) in Attack Position. "Thunder Giant" attacks "Doll Chimera". Jaden then activates " Battle x 2 " to double the ATK of "Thunder Giant" during damage calculation ("Thunder Giant": 2400 → 4800/1500). Both "Thunder Giant" and "Doll Chimera" are destroyed in a  Double KO . Alice attempts to activate the effect of " Doll Chimera ", but she does not have any  Doll Part  monsters left in her deck.
 "Rallis the Star Bird" attacks "Alice the Wandering Doll". The effect of "Rallis the Star Bird" activates and "Alice the Wandering Doll" is Level 3 ("Rallis": 800 → 1400/800). Due to the effect of "Alice the Wandering Doll" it is not destroyed. The effect of "Alice the Wandering Doll" then activates (Jaden 1500 → 1000) and control of "Alice the Wandering Doll" is given to Jaden. At the end of the  Damage Step , "Rallis the Star Bird" is  removed from play . 
 Jaden then activates "Spy Hero" to send two random cards from his  Deck  to the  Graveyard  and add "Doll Hammer" from Alice's  Graveyard  to his hand. Jaden then activates "Doll Hammer" to destroy "Alice the Wandering Doll" and draw two cards. Alice then activates her face-down " Released Curse " to destroy all cards on the field and inflict 300 damage to both players for each of their destroyed cards (Jaden 1000 → 700; Alice 1100 → 800). Jaden then activates "Fusion Recovery" to add "Polymerization" and "Sparkman" from his Graveyard to his hand. He then Sets two cards.
 Turn 7: Alice 
Alice draws " Door to Mirrorland " and subsequently activates it to  Special Summon  " Eshila the Lovely Bisque Doll " (1000/300) in  Attack Position . Due to the effect of "Eshila", it gains 1000  ATK  for every set of 4 differently named " Doll Parts " in Alice's Graveyard. There are currently three " Doll Part " sets in Alice's Graveyard ("Eshila": 1000 → 4000) "Eshila the Lovely Bisque Doll" attacks directly, but Jaden activates his face-down " The Flute of Summoning Kuriboh " to  Special Summon  " Winged Kuriboh " (300/200) in Attack Position. Jaden then activates his face-down " Transcendent Wings " to discard two cards, send "Winged Kuriboh" to the  Graveyard , and  Special Summon  " Winged Kuriboh LV10 " (300/200) in Attack Position. Jaden then Tributes "Winged Kuriboh LV10" to activate its effect, destroying "Eshila the Lovely Bisque Doll" and inflicting damage to Alice equal to the  original ATK  of "Eshila" (Alice 800 → 0).
 
 Trivia 
 The Japanese title of this episode is a reference to  Alice in Wonderland . 
 The American title of this episode is a reference to the 90's where males would say "what a doll" meaning she's cute. 
 Errors in the dub 
 When Jaden uses " Metamorphosis " to summon " Elemental Hero Neo Bubbleman " he says that he's summoning a  Fusion Monster  from his hand instead of his  Fusion Deck . If "Neo Bubbleman" were summoned by its  TCG  effect, it would be summoned from the hand. 
 When Jaden uses " Spy Hero ", he says that he's taking a  Spell Card  from Alice's  Deck  while we see it coming from her  Graveyard . 
 When Alice explains the effect of " Eshila the Lovely Bisque Doll ", she says that it gains 1000  ATK  "for every 4  Doll Part  sets" in her  Graveyard  when she meant for every set of 4 Doll Parts.
