 Major events 
 Not an official  Battle City  Duel. 
 Whoever wins gets the other player's  Millennium Item . 
 Yami Bakura  Duels with regular Marik by his side. 
 Many abilities of " The Winged Dragon of Ra " are revealed. 
 As the player's  Life Points  decrease, they lose a portion of their body. 
 Bakura and Marik lose, and were sent to the Shadow Realm (temporarily killed in the Japanese version), along with the  good Bakura . 
 When Yami Bakura was defeated he exclaimed "Don't you realize that I am the darkness?" This foreshadows Yami Bakura's true identity as Zorc which is revealed in the final episodes of the series. 
 Marik controls Téa in order to speak with Ishizu and have her hide Odion from Yami Marik. 
 Featured Duel: Yami Bakura vs. Yami Marik, Part 2 
 Duel continued from previous episode. 
 Yami Bakura has 1900  Life Points  remaining and controls "Headless Knight" (1450/1700), "Goblin Zombie" (1100/1050), "The Earl of Demise" (2000/700), and "Puppet Master" (0/0) in Attack Position.
 Yami Marik has 4000 Life Points remaining and controls " Drillago " (1600/1100) in Attack Position and one set card.
 Turn 6: Yami Marik 
Yami Marik draws " Vengeful Bog Spirit " and subsequently activates it. Now monsters on the field can't attack the turn they are summoned.
 Turn 7: Yami Bakura 
Yami Bakura's hand contains "Premature Burial", " The Portrait's Secret ", "The Winged Dragon of Ra", and  Spirit Message "N" . Yami Bakura draws. He then  Tributes  " Headless Knight ", " Goblin Zombie ", and " The Earl of Demise " in order to  Tribute Summon  " The Winged Dragon of Ra " (????/????) in  Attack Position , but  Yami Marik  activates his face-down " Joyful Doom " to decrease the Tributed monsters'  ATK  to 0 before they are Tributed and increase his  Life Points  by the total decreased amount (Yami Marik 4000 → 8550). The  original ATK and DEF  of "The Winged Dragon of Ra" is equal to the ATK and  DEF  of every  monster  used for its Tribute Summon ("The Winged Dragon of Ra": ???? → 0/???? → 3450) through its own effect. Yami Bakura switches " Puppet Master " and "The Winged Dragon of Ra" to  Defense Position .
 Turn 8: Yami Marik 
Yami Marik draws. " Drillago "  attacks  and  destroys  "Puppet Master". Yami Marik's hand contains "Monster Reborn", " Makyura the Destructor ", " Rope of Life ", " Card of Last Will ", " Pot of Greed ", and " Holding Legs ".
 Turn 9: Yami Bakura 
Yami Bakura draws. He then Tributes "The Winged Dragon of Ra" in order to Tribute Summon " The Dark Ruler " in (2450/1600) Attack Position. Yami Bakura then  Removes  from play "Gernia", "Headless Knight", and "Puppet Master" from his  Graveyard  to  Special Summon  " Dark Necrofear " in (2200/2800) Attack Position. Yami Bakura then activates " Premature Burial " to  pay  800 Life Points ( Yami Bakura  1900 → 1100) and revive "The Earl of Demise" (2000/700) in Attack Position. 
 Turn 10: Yami Marik 
Yami Marik draws. He then activates " Monster Reborn " to revive "The Winged Dragon of Ra" (0/0) in Attack Position. He then activates the  Instant Attack  and  Point-to-Point Transfer  effects of "The Winged Dragon of Ra" to allow Ra to attack this turn, pay all but 1 of his Life Points (Yami Marik 8550 → 1) to increase its ATK and DEF by the paid amount ("The Winged Dragon of Ra": 0 → 8549/0 → 8549) as well as allow "Ra" to attack every monster Yami Bakura controls once each. "The Winged Dragon of Ra" attacks and destroys all of Yami Bakura's monsters (Yami Bakura 1100 → 0 → 0 → 0). "The Winged Dragon of Ra" then attacks directly (Yami Bakura 0 → 0).
 
 Errors 
 In Part 1 of the Shadow Game, the Millennium Puzzle is on the left of Yugi's pillow, but in this episode, it is on the nightstand to the right of the bed. 
 In Part 1, the Millennium Rod is seen only once with Yami Marik (in the back of his pants' belt, but it disappears after that one scene), but then in this episode he somehow shows it to Yami Bakura and the regular Marik. However, the Rod is once again not seen for the rest of the duel after he shows it to them in the duel and the flashback. 
 In the dub,  The Portrait's Secret  and  The Earl of Demise  are shown in Marik's hand, a mistake not present in the original. 
 Differences Between Versions 
 When Tea begins to be controlled by Marik, a yellow glow is added around her head in the English version. 
 During Ishizu's dream of Marik being consumed by the Shadows, the English version's flames of Ra are purple instead of regular ones, making Marik and his gold bands look more purple, his hair lighter, and his shirt white. 
 When Marik, in Tea's body, goes to Ishizu, the English Marik asks her for help but doesn't reveal what it is onscreen, while his Japanese version just begs her to save Odion from his darker self. 
 When Yami Marik tries again to get rid of Odion, the blade inside the Millennium Rod is once again digitized out in the English version. 
 A shot of Yami Bakura engulfed by Ra's flames is removed from the English dub. Ironically, the said scene appears much later on in the dub, but with the flames recolored purple.
