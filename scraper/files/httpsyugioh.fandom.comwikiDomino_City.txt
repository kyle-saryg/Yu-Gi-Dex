      Domino City.     
 Domino City  ( 童実野 町 ,  Domino-chō ) is a fictional Japanese city in the various  Yu-Gi-Oh!  series. It is the home of  Yugi Muto  and the main setting of many storylines. At one point in the English dub of the anime, it is erroneously said to be in the United States. The city is named after the  domino  game tile. 
 Many of  Yami Yugi 's  Shadow Games  and the  Battle City ,  D1 Grand Prix ,  Fortune Cup  and  World Racing Grand Prix  tournaments all took place in Domino City.
 Almost all the residents were wiped out when  Trueman   stormed the city , but restored after the defeat of  Nightshroud . The  Zero Reverse   Ener-D  incident split the city into two parts, the modernized  New Domino City  and the isolated poverty-stricken  Satellite  island. The battle between the  Signers  and  Dark Signers  took place in the city. Afterwards, Satellite and New Domino were reunited in equality. 200 years later, the city's use of Ener-D resulted in the  Meklord Emperor invasion and genocide . The apocalypse survivors turned the Satellite remnants into the  Divine Temple , with the intent of sending it to the past to crush Domino City and prevent the genocide. Ultimately the city was not destroyed and the residents took care to prevent the future apocalypse from happening again.

 History 
 1990s 
       Domino City in the 1990s     
 In 1996, [1]  Atem reawakened in  Yugi Muto 's body, as  Yami Yugi , in Domino City. [2]  He defeated many people who wronged Yugi and his friends in  various   Shadow Games , within the city, and inflicted  Penalty Games  on the losers.
 
       Domino City Plaza , where Battle City began and where time travelers arrived.     
 Mythical powers from Ancient civilizations were awakened in the city, including the Egyptian  Millennium Items , [2]   Egyptian Gods , the Chinese  Dragon Cards , [3]  the  Atlantean   Orichalcos  and  Duel Monster Spirits , [4]  usually resulting in Shadow Games involving Yami Yugi. Exhibitions such as  Egypt Unearthed [1]  and  The Art of Egypt  took place in  Domino City Museum , [5]  as did the  Shadow RPG . [6] 
 Seto Kaiba  opened the first  Kaiba Land , with  Death-T  designed to kill the Yugis as its main attraction. [7]  At a later date, Kaiba hosted the  Battle City   Duel Monsters  tournament, using the entire city as its battlefield. [8] 
 Jaden Yuki was transported from about  2000s  to Domino Plaza in this time period. For the duration of his visit, other people were not present with the exception of Yugi Muto and clocks had stopped. The two engaged in a Duel before Jaden was sent back to his time.
 In another altered timeline,  Paradox  traveled from  22XX  to Domino City in this time period, in an attempt to kill  Maximillion Pegasus  at a publicity event and destroy the game of Duel Monsters in order to prevent his apocalyptic future from happening. However he was followed through time by  Yusei Fudo  and  Jaden Yuki , who together with Yugi and Yami Yugi defeated Paradox. [9] 
 
 2000s 
 In 2006, [10]  students from  Duel Academy  went on a field trip to Domino City. Some students were shown many of the iconic locations from  Battle City  and forced into Duels with  Sarina  and  The Light Brigade . [11] 
 Trueman  attempted to purge the world of human life. When someone felt negative emotions, he was able to materialize through their  Duel Monsters  cards and absorb the human into the  World of Darkness , causing any trace of their existence, including people's memories to be erased. He was successful in absorbing the souls of many citizens of Domino, with  Seto Kaiba  being a known exception.
 
 20XX 
         The Zero Reverse.     
 In the 21st century, [12]  Domino came to rely heavily on  Ener-D  as a power source. However an overload caused the Ener-D reactor to spin in the opposite direction and cause the  Zero Reverse  effect, a disastrous tectonic shift, which caused a portion of the city to break off and opened a gateway to the Netherworld. The portion of city that broke off became the island,  Satellite , while the remainder became known as  New Domino City .
 
   New Domino City.   Satellite island. 1/2 
 The Satellite island became an isolated community for criminals and people living in poverty. The island suffered urban decay and was used as a recycling plant for the waste from New Domino, with residents of Satellite working in factories. The Satellite community were denied the luxuries that New Domino residents got, were not allowed to leave and were often looked down upon by residents of New Domino. There only thing connecting Satellite and New Domino was a single  pipeline  used for transporting waste.
 In Satellite,  Rex Goodwin , anonymous to people at the time, began unauthorized construction of  Daedalus Bridge  to connect to New Domino. He soon became a wanted man and while fleeing police, he attempted to fly his Duel Runner from the bridge to New Domino. He survived the incident, losing his arm in the process. In New Domino, he became director of  Sector Security  and ensured that Satellite remained isolated. Goodwin claimed this was to cleanse New Domino of evil, making it a Utopia. He later claimed it was because the gateway to the Netherworld was in Satellite and it had to potential to awaken the Dark Signers, whom he wanted to keep out of the city.
 
         The attack on the Arcadia Movement building.     
 17 years after the Zero Reverse, the  Signers  and  Dark Signers  waged battles in the city materializing the  Earthbound Immortals  and  Signer Dragons  through  Duel Monsters  cards. Goodwin hosted the  Fortune Cup  tournament in New Domino to bring the Signers together. The Earthbound Immortals resurrected and possessed people as they died with unfinished business, particularly a lust for revenge. Despite the separation of Satellite and New Domino City, the Dark Signers entered New Domino. Among the battles involving the Dark Signers, was the destruction of the  Arcadia Movement building , which was caused by attacks from Earthbound Immortals. Goodwin managed to become both a Signer and Dark Signer, erected the  Stairway to the Dragon Star  in the city and awakened the  King of the Netherworld , which began to make its way towards the stairway. However Goodwin was defeated by the Signers and the  Crimson Dragon  destroyed the King.
 
         Domino City being evacuated during the descent of the Divine Temple.     
 Following the defeat of the Dark Signers, Satellite and New Domino City became connected with a network of bridges and residents were free to travel between the two areas.
 The  World Racing Grand Prix  (WRGP) took place in New Domino City.  Iliaster  time travelers from  22XX ,  Z-one ,  Aporia  and  Antinomy  used this tournament as a chance to complete the  Grand Design . Aporia's embodiments,  Jakob ,  Primo  and  Lester , used  falsification of history  to change time, erasing the existence of  Momentum Express Development Organization  and entering themselves into the WRGP. They were defeated in the finals, but succeeded in completing the Grand Design, allowing the  Divine Temple  to descend on the city, with the intent of destroying it. An evacuation of the city was ordered. However the Signers boarded the Divine Temple and defeated Antinomy, Aporia and Z-one. Z-one then sacrificed his life to reverse the rotation of the temple's Ener-D reactor stopping the descent.
 
 Manga 
 Domino City was split into the deprived Satellite island and the wealthy New Domino City.  Rex Goodwin  organized the  D1 Grand Prix  and had the first stage take place in New Domino and the second stage take place in Satellite.
 
 22XX 
 The following events were erased after Z-one's attempt to change history.
 
   New Domino City in the 23rd century, before the Meklord genocide.   New Domino City in the 23rd century, after the Meklord genocide. 1/2 
 In the 23rd century, [13]  Domino had a number of structures floating midair. The city used a lot more Ener-D and  Synchro Summons , evolving quickly. According to  Aporia , people became corrupt as a result, causing the  Meklord Emperor invasion . The Meklords attacked the planet and began wiping out humanity. [14]  One of the survivors,  Z-one  managed to modify his own body and mind, to make himself look and act like  Yusei Fudo . He began leading a large group of survivors, discouraging their corruptness, causing the Meklords to refrain from attacking them. However the people's negativity caused a destructive negative Ener-D rotation and Meklords began to self-destruct. This killed many of the survivors and caused damage to  Z-one's head device , causing him to act less like Yusei and give up on his old plan. [15] 
 Over the next few decades, Z-one worked on a way to undo the apocalyptic events. He recruited fellow survivors  Antinomy ,  Paradox  and  Aporia  over this time and outlived all of them. He found a way to travel back in time and constructed the  Divine Temple  with the remains of Satellite. Paradox reconstruction back to through various eras to collect equipment to try and kill  Duel Monsters  creator Pegasus in Domino City in the  1990s . He sent himself and the reconstructions of Antinomy and Aporia back to  20XX  to try and destroy Domino City with the Divine Temple.
