 History 
   This summary is currently incomplete. 
 This event has run two times, throughout the following time periods:
 
 December 20, 2016, 0:00 (EST) until December 27, 2016, 0:00 (EST) 
 January 31, 2017, 23:30 (EST) until February 8, 2017, 0:00 (EST) 
 Event Details 
 During the event, once the player logs into Duel Links for the first time since the event started (or if they were already logged-in at the time, then immediately when they entered one of the four Duel World outdoor locations, if they weren't at one already), they will be greeted by Pegasus. Pegasus then explains to the player that he organized this event as a form of thanks to  Kaiba  for creating a world where everyone can play  Duel Monsters , and that he intends for this event to replicate the greatest tournament ever:  Duelist Kingdom .
 
 Challenging Pegasus 
 In order to challenge  Maximillion Pegasus , the player must be at Stage 4 or higher. Additionally, they must spend a certain amount of Star Chips in order to challenge Pegasus, with these Star Chips being earned from winning Duels against Standard/Legendary Duelists (with the amount of Star Chips earned dependent on which Stage the player is currently at). During the February 2017 version of this event, whenever players earned Star Chips this way, they also received 10 bonus Star Chips the first two times this occurred each day (with 'new days' starting from 13:00 (UTC)).
 At first, Pegasus will only be able to be challenged at Level 10. Once the player defeats him, however, he will then be able to be challenged at Level 20. To challenge him at higher Levels (up to Level 40), the player needs to defeat him at least once at the highest available Level (e.g. he needs to be defeated at Level 20 before he can be challenged at Level 30). In order to challenge Pegasus at a certain Level, the player needs to spend a corresponding amount of Star Chips, which is as follows:
 
 
 
 Level 10
 
 Level 20
 
 Level 30
 
 Level 40
 
 
 5 Star Chips
 
 10 Star Chips
 
 20 Star Chips
 
 40 Star Chips
 
 Additionally, no matter what Level Pegasus is challenged at, the Duel will always begin with him having the  Skill  "It's a Toon World".
 
 Rewards 
 After each Duel with Pegasus, the player will earn event points equal to their Duel Assessment score, multiplied by an amount corresponding to the Level Pegasus was challenged at. The standard Duel Assessment penalties for losing still apply with regards to the event points earned. The multipliers vary depending on when the event was held.
 As the player continues to earn event points, they will earn rewards from the event for each "milestone" they reach in terms of accumulated event points. When earned, these rewards are deposited into the player's Gift Box, where they have exactly 30 days (from the time they were deposited) to be claimed before expiring.
 Additionally, the standard possible Duel Rewards from Dueling Pegasus (a Legendary Duelist) are generally more bountiful than normal, as compared to Duel Rewards from Duels with other Legendary Duelists, but differ depending on when the event was held.
 Each time this event is held, if the player has any remaining Star Chips when the event concludes, they will be removed from the player's inventory. However, for the February 2017 version of this event, any remaining Star Chips were instead converted into Gold, at a rate of 3 Gold per Star Chip.

 Trivia 
 This event is unique in that it marks the first time that a Legendary Duelist (Pegasus) is capable of using a Skill in their Duels against the player. 
 With the exception of  Ishizu Ishtar ,  Mako Tsunami , and  Odion , the player will receive a unique dialogue when they challenge Pegasus (as a Legendary Duelist) to a Duel with a certain character, for each character. Until the player successfully completes a Duel with one of those characters versus Pegasus (i.e. a win, draw, or loss), the unique dialogue will always occur whenever Pegasus is challenged by that character. 
 Notes 
 
 ↑   If the player already had the ability to use Maximillion Pegasus as a playable character, they instead received 1 UR Jewel in their Gift Box.
