 "Night of the Living Duelist" , known as  "Duel Academia's Crisis! The Terror of the Zombie Students!"  in the Japanese version, is the one hundred and twenty-second episode of the  Yu-Gi-Oh! GX  anime. It first aired in Japan on February 7, 2007 and in the US on October 6, 2007.
 Jaden  attempts to make it back to  Duel Academy , while  the demon  gathers  minions  to assault food storage.
 
 Summary 
 Blair Flannigan 's condition is worsening.  Jaden Yuki  and his group are en route back to  Duel Academy  from the Gecko Submarine with medicine for her. Groups of students have organized around the perimeter of the school, watching for trouble and ready to defend it should it be attacked, though they agree to only summon monsters as a last resort, as the  Bio-Bands  are still active. Fortunately, the student's PDAs are still functioning, so they are able to use them as communicators.
 Bastion Misawa  is in the gym, trying to solve a complex equation in an effort to get Duel Academy back to Earth. He cannot concentrate, as other students are frustrated at the small food portions they receive and begin arguing over whose piece of bread is bigger. Furious, Bastion splits his share between the leaders of the fight, in the hope of shutting them up. This only leads to them complaining about how the other's half is bigger, and more pandemonium ensues.
 Marcel Bonaparte , still possessed by  Yubel , begins gathering followers. He turns two students in  Duel Ghouls  (zombie students in the Japanese version) and uses them to duel and defeat more students. Any defeated are drained of their energy by their Bio-Bands and become Duel Ghouls themselves.  Chazz Princeton  has been assigned to guard the food storage facility. It's attacked by Marcel's Duel Ghouls, and Chazz defeats the first one in a  single turn , but is eventually overwhelmed when more attack simultaneously.
 Jaden's group has nearly reached Duel Academy, and they see a " Sand Moth " heading towards it.  Axel Brodie  destroys it using " Blaze Accelerator " and " Volcanic Shell ". As more " Sand Moths " emerge to attack, Axel stays behind to defeat them and urges the others to run. When they get inside, they are assaulted by Duel Ghouls, and are rescued by  Alexis Rhodes  and  Tyranno Hassleberry  who part the crowds with a trolley, who urge them not to duel. According to Alexis, the gym and  Chancellor Sheppard 's office are the safest places, and thus the unaffected students have gathered in the gym.
 While attempting to reach the infirmary, they're opposed by  Syrus Truesdale , who's also become a Duel Ghoul. Surrounded on all sides, Jaden summons " Elemental Hero Flame Wingman " and uses it to destroy the wall behind them, allowing them to escape.  Nurse Fontaine  manages to contact Jaden via his PDA after many tries and reveals that the Duel Ghouls are attempting to get into the infirmary while  Blair Flannigan 's condition worsens.

 Featured Duel: Chazz Princeton vs. A Duel Ghoul 
 Turn 1: Duel Ghoul 
The Duel Ghoul draws " Abaki " and subsequently Normal Summons it (1700/1000) in Attack Position.
 Turn 2: Chazz 
Chazz's hand contains " Ojamandala ", " Ojama Yellow ", " Infernal Incinerator ", " Premature Burial ", and " Megamorph ". Chazz draws " Tribute to the Doomed " and subsequently activates it to discard "Infernal Incinerator" and destroy "Abaki". Chazz then activates "Premature Burial" to pay 800 Life Points (Chazz 4000 → 3200) and Special Summon "Infernal Incinerator" from his Graveyard (2800/1800) in Attack Position.
 Chazz then activates "Megamorph", equipping it to "Infernal Incinerator" and doubling its ATK since Chazz has less Life Points than the Duel Ghoul ("Infernal Incinerator": 2800 → 5600/1800). "Infernal Incinerator" attacks directly (Duel Ghoul 4000 → 0).
