 This card can be searched by " Heritage of the Chalice ", " Infernoble Knight - Roland ", " Noble Knight Borz ", " Ignoble Knight of High Laundsallyn ", " Ignoble Knight of Black Laundsallyn ", " Glory of the Noble Knights ", " Armory Call ", " Noble Knight's Spearholder ", " Hidden Armory ", " Gearbreed ", " Power Tool Dragon ", " Vylon Cube ", " Vylon Delta ", " Vylon Sigma ", " Iron Blacksmith Kotetsu " and " Fairy Tail - Rella ".
 "Armory Call" (or " Swords at Dawn " targeting this card in the Graveyard) can equip this card to a monster that is being attacked, in order to then destroy the attacking monster after the equipped monster is destroyed. 
 This card is a major upgrade over " Twin Swords of Flashing Light - Tryce ", in exchange for effectively being single-use. It can be equipped to  direct attackers  without reducing damage output. 
 Equipping this card to a battle tutor such as " Giant Rat " effectively adds the effect of " Newdoria " to said monster. Avoid activating the double-attacking effect in this case, otherwise the monster tutored out will not be able to attack that turn.
