 "Starting Duel Team ZEXAL!!"  is the first chapter of the  Yu-Gi-Oh! D Team ZEXAL  manga. It was first published April 3, 2012, in the  Saikyō Jump  magazine.
 
 Summary 
 Yuma Tsukumo  aims to be the  Duel  champion, and  Astral  is the spirit who watches over him. However, Yuma, who is late, runs towards the first reunion of his team. He then meets  Kotori ,  Tetsuo  and  Takashi , completing the  Team ZEXAL . The other members complain about Yuma's delay, and explain that a  Dueling Team  is made in order to learn the rules of  Dueling , creating new tactics and becoming stronger. Astral says being in a team can help Yuma Duel like him, and Yuma replies saying that's not true. However, only Yuma can see Astral, and the other members get confused. Kotori gets worried about having someone like Yuma as the team's leader, and then Tetsuo challenges Yuma to Duel, saying that if he beats Yuma again, he will be the leader instead. Yuma accepts the challenge, and they begin a Duel.
