 This card can be  searched  by " Dark Sage ", " Ancient Gear Drill ", " Angmarl the Fiendish Monarch ", " Left Arm Offering ", " Terraforming ", " An Owl of Luck ", " Demise of the Land ", " Madolche Butlerusk ", " Planet Pathfinder ", " Pop-Up ", " Metaverse ", and " Set Rotation ". 
 This card is ideal for  Rock  defense decks, as rocks are generally  EARTH  attribute, with low ATK and high DEF, although " Chorus of Sanctuary " is a better choice.
 However, the  ATK  decreasing effect of this card will prove useful if the opponent uses  EARTH  monsters to attack, as long as you use yours only to defend. As an example, an opponent's " Goyo Guardian " would be unable to defeat any of your EARTH monsters with 1900 or more  DEF . You can use " DNA Transplant " to guarantee the 900-point swing in the matchup. 
 This card can work well in decks centered around " Superheavy Samurai Big Benkei "; the ATK-reduction effect will only hinder your opponent, and the DEF-increasing effect will help make your monsters more powerful in battle. 
 This card can anti-support EARTH archetypes that focus on high ATK, like " Gouki ". 
 Traditional Format 
 This card can be searched by " Ancient Fairy Dragon ".
