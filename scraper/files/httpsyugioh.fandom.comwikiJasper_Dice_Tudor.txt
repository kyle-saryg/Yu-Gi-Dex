 Jasper Dice Tudor  is the  Yu-Gi-Oh! The Duelists of the Roses  incarnation of  Solomon Muto  and portrayal of  Jasper Tudor . He is a member of the Red Roses located at  Le Mans .
 After the player defeats  J. Shadi Morton , the path to Le Mans appears where they can play Jasper. After beating him the path to Rennes appears where  Bakura  is located.
 Players can obtain the card " Dharma Cannon ", using the  find  ability on C4, while playing against Jasper. 
 Although defeated, he respects the player's strength, but feels sorrow for them for choosing to side with evil.
 
 Deck 
 Jasper uses an  Exodia  Deck . He uses Labyrinth squares to shield himself while he summons his pieces of "Exodia". It is best to summon high ATK monsters and push back his offensive cards. If one of your monsters is in the way after being paralyzed and there is an empty square you can summon a new card in, go over it and send it to the Graveyard. When all the pieces of "Exodia" have been put together, he instantly wins.
