 Summary 
 When  Anzu  realizes that  Yugi  is her mysterious crush, she invites him on a date to an amusement park, intending to put herself in danger so that she can see  Dark Yugi . However, she finds herself in real danger when the  Continuous Bomber  challenges Dark Yugi to a twisted game of balloons and bombs.
 Dark Yugi is able to defeat the mad bomber and rescue Anzu. Anzu is finally saved and she thanks Dark Yugi, saying that she and Dark Yugi should continue their "date".
 
 Trivia 
 All known recordings of this episode have visual glitches during the  Game of Darkness  with the Continuous Bomber (most notably whenever a gondola is blown up and when Dark Yugi subjects the bomber to a  Penalty Game ).
