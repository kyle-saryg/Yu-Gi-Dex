 Mathmech Deck 
 Kuroda's main strategy is to swarm the field with his Level 4  Mathmech  monsters such as " Addition ", " Subtraction ", " Sigma " and " Nabla " to bring out his sole ace monster : " Geomathmech Final Sigma ", whose double damage effect combined with " Mathmech Billionblade Nayuta " and " Mathmech Multiplication " allows him to OTK his opponent. If this strategy fails, Kuroda relies on Final Sigma's protection and searching effect, along with " Mathmech Equation ", to start the strategy over the next turn.
