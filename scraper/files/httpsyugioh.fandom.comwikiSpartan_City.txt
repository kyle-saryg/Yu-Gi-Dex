 Nistro  and  Dextra  grew up as orphans in this city, with  Duel Monsters  being their only shred of hope. In search of a  Mythyrian "Number" ,  Yuma  and his friends arrived in this city to learn of a  Duel tournament  that Nistro is participating in, with Dextra serving as his manager. There, they learned that a "Mythyrian Number" was hidden underneath a lake. The city also has a large arena, where the Pro Duelist Spartancity Tournament was held which concluded in Nistro's victory.
