 Description 
 As the biggest and baddest Celebrity Duelist in LINK VRAINS, The Gore helped Playmaker slam the Knights of Hanoi into submission. But when the public gave Playmaker all the credit, The Gore changed his style in order to restore his rep and remain a role model for the kids in the orphanage. When he Duels, he lets his opponent play their best strategies - only to crush them strong style with his Gouki Deck.
