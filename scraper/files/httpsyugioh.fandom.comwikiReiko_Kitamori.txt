 Biography 
       Reiko Summoning one of her monsters.     
 She is encountered by  Jonouchi  and  Honda , who had been searching for her, while she herself is apparently buying snacks from a vending machine. Apparently stricken with fear, she runs off, leaving Jonouchi and Honda to give chase. After failing to make it to the elevator in time, she reveals that she's afraid of Duelists, and that her companions told her to guard her block as a last resort, but regardless, says she'll do her best, refusing to simply hand them the key to the next block. 
 After the Duel starts, she reveals that she only began playing  Duel Monsters  about a month before the story takes place, shocking Jonouchi greatly, who is shocked at her level of skill, even complimenting her several times. After figuring out her strategy, Jonouchi asks her if she enjoys Dueling, claiming that a Duel without  attacks  is no fun. This causes her to change her strategy, also leading to her defeat. 
 After she loses, she admits that she did not have an actual Key Card, and was simply a 'throw-away pawn' to stall for time, signifying she had a rather low standing amongst her peers.
 She is shown to have a very polite and innocent personality, much like Joey's sister Serenity, being polite for an enemy. During the Duel, she even shows signs of developing a crush on Jonouchi.
