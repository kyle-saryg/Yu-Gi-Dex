 The  February 2004 Forbidden and Limited Lists  were Forbidden and Limited lists in the  TCG , going into effect on February 2,  2004 . [1] 
 This list updated the previous  November 2003  list, adding four cards from the Booster Pack  Dark Crisis , and changing one card from  Limited  to  Semi-Limited . This list was followed by the  April 2004 Forbidden and Limited List .
 In late February or early April, a note was added mentioning that while the OCG Forbidden and Limited List had recently forbidden 10 cards, this did not apply to the TCG and there were no plans to ban them in the future. [2]
