Kaiba mainly runs Decks that centralize on a  beatdown  strategy to aggressively overwhelm his opponents with high ATK monsters. During the first several arcs of the Yu-Gi-Oh anime, his Deck is composed of vicious-looking monsters, with most of them being  DARK   Fiend -Type. The Spells and Traps in his Deck normally serve to disrupt and counter any strategies his opponents would use. His monster lineup is spearheaded by his signature card, " Blue-Eyes White Dragon " and its Fusion form, " Blue-Eyes Ultimate Dragon ". In the later arcs, he incorporates " Virus " Trap Cards such as " Giant Germ ", " Crush Card ", and " Virus Cannon " that give it the traits of a Virus Control Deck and  swarm  Deck, destroying all monsters in his opponent's Deck with more than 1500 ATK, further crippling their ability to defend against him.  
 As the series evolves, Kaiba's switches his focus towards  Dragon -Type monsters. His later Decks incorporate an array of Dragon and Dragon-Type support cards such as " Spirit Ryu ", " Spear Dragon ", " Luster Dragon #2 ", " Different Dimension Dragon ", " Paladin of White Dragon ", and " Chaos Emperor Dragon - Envoy of the End " while still maintaining "Blue Eyes White Dragon" and "Blue Eyes Ultimate Dragon" as his most aggressive boss monsters. His later Decks still retain much of the aggressive beatdown strategies to wreak havoc upon his opponents with high ATK incorporated with Dragon-type support cards that contain inherent self-protection effects.

 During  Duelist Kingdom , his Deck utilized various brutal appearing monsters to reflect his personality.  Ghost Kaiba  also utilized Kaiba's Deck and the  Duel Computer  also used some of his cards when Kaiba wanted to test  his new Duel Disk system . Notably, his signature card (through all seasons of the anime and manga) is the " Blue-Eyes White Dragon ". His main plan consists of using " Saggi the Dark Clown " as bait, then use " Crush Card " to destroy the opponent's Deck. Against Yugi he tries regaining Life Points or destroying the opponents cards to stall until he draws the right cards required for Summoning " Blue-Eyes Ultimate Dragon " for the final blow.

 In  Battle City , Kaiba's Deck takes on several traits of a  Virus  Deck , which focuses on removing cards from his opponents' Decks and leaving them with limited options. One of the main strategies in this Deck includes using " Crush Card Virus " and " Virus Cannon " to  mill  his opponents' Decks, while also attempting to Summon " Obelisk the Tormentor " for the finishing blow. His "Obelisk the Tormentor" is supported with " Soul Exchange ", and if that fails, he implements parts of a Machine deck representing Kaiba's expertise in technology; he mainly uses his " XYZ " monsters offensively until he is able to Summon "Obelisk".

 During the Waking the Dragons arc, Kaiba uses a  Virus / Critias  Deck . Kaiba's Deck evolves considerably, as he begins to include many more  Dragons  in his Deck, while also gaining " Fang of Critias ", and still supporting " Blue-Eyes White Dragon " and " XYZ " monsters. He supports many of his Trap Cards with "Fang of Critias", creating powerful monsters to defeat the opponent.

 Seto's Battle City Deck is very similar to his anime Deck, and it also contains one Level 8 unnamed monster.  Dark Marik  described his Deck during his Duel with Yugi as a  Power Deck  designed to suppress the opponent with monsters while gathering sacrifices to Summon his God card. Kaiba is not limited to using his own monsters, however, making liberal use of " Soul Exchange " to use his opponent's monsters as the sacrifices he needed. At the same time, he did not abandon his " Blue-Eyes White Dragons ," often using them as either backup or a temporary replacement for "Obelisk," and including multiple methods to Summon them with the utilization of the ordinary twin-Tribute method. He also retained his Virus strategies, which he used against Ishizu, but he likely temporarily abandoned them in the manga after learning that his " Crush Card " strategy would be ineffective against "Ra."
