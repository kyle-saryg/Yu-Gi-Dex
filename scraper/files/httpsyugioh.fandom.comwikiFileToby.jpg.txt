 Biography 
 History 
 Toby developed  Psychic Dueling  powers as a child. He attended  The New Domino City Duel Academy  with  Akiza Izinski .
 On his elder sister,  Misty's , birthday, Toby gave her a golden heart-shaped locket, with a picture of both of them inside.
 
 Arcadia Movement 
 Toby learned Akiza had also psychic powers like him and came to idolize her. He asked Akiza what he could do to be like her. Akiza replied that he should listen to  Sayer , the leader of the  Arcadia Movement .
 
       Sayer  pushes Toby past his limits.     
 Having heard bad things about the Arcadia Movement, Misty disapproved of Toby getting involved with them.
 Sayer took Toby for testing. Results said Toby's powers were weak, as he could barely withstand the procedure. Having little concern for someone he deemed weak, Sayer ordered the intensity of the procedure to be upped, not caring if it killed the boy. The intensity was increased and Toby was shocked, killing him in the process.
 In the dub, however, Toby's death is only implied; instead of death references, people instead stated that he went missing and Sayer placed him with the other people who also had poor psychic abilities. When Misty asked where he was during her second Duel with Akiza, Sayer said that he was sent to a secret location, its coordinates ever changing, in which not even he knows.
 
 
 Post death 
 Toby's dead body was left at the  Daimon Area , where it was discovered, although difficult to recognize, days after his disappearance. It was believed that Toby had visited the area to watch the Black Rose Duel and got crushed by a chunk of a building that was damaged by the Witch Dueling.
 People who heard of Toby's death unanimously agreed that it was the Black Rose's doing.  Rex Goodwin , head of  Sector Security  worried about the secrets that  Sayer , knew about him, so he only arranged a brief investigation consisting of a single police interview with the  Arcadia Movement . No conclusive evidence was made.
 The news of Toby's death caused Misty to drive carelessly, resulting in her accidentally driving off a cliff, hospitalizing her. As Misty was about to die, she was chosen by the  Earthbound Immortals  to be reborn as a  Dark Signer . With her rebirth, Misty was set on getting revenge on the Black Rose to avenge her brother.
 A year after his death, Misty Dueled the Black Rose, Akiza. During the Duel,  Yusei Fudo  forced Sayer into speaking out loud about what really happened, using his  Duel Disk 's microphone. After this happened, Misty had  Earthbound Immortal Ccarayhua  eat Sayer alive in front of Yusei and Akiza (in the dub, she had it take the Arcadia Movement's leader somewhere unknown), never to be seen again.
