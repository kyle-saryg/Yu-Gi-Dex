 Featured Duel: Yuma Tsukumo vs. Kaze 
 Duel continues from  the previous episode . 
 Turn 2: Kaze 
 Kaze   Sets  two cards.
 
       " Dododo Warrior " is Summoned.     
 Turn 3: Yuma Yuma   draws  " Dododo Warrior " and subsequently  Normal Summons  it in Attack Position via its own effect by decreasing its ATK by 500 ( 6/2300 → 1800/900). He then  activates  " Full-Force Strike " to target "Dododo Warrior". Now for this turn, players take no  battle damage  from  battles  involving "Dododo Warrior", but any monster that battles "Dododo Warrior" will be  destroyed  at the end of the  Damage Step . "Dododo Warrior"  attacks  " Blade Armor Ninja ", but Kaze activates his  face-down  " Armor Ninjitsu Art of Freezing " to end the  Battle Phase  as he  controls  a  face-up  " Ninja " monster. As long as this card remains face-up, Yuma's monsters cannot change their  battle positions  while Kaze controls a "Ninja" monster. Yuma Sets a card.
 Turn 4: Kaze 
Kaze draws " Spy Attack " and subsequently activates it to  send  " Aqua Armor Ninja " from his  hand  to the  Graveyard  (as it's a monster) to look at a set card in Yuma's  Spell & Trap Zone . He selects Yuma's only set card, which is revealed to be " Gagagaback ". "Blade Armor Ninja" attacks and destroys " Gagaga Magician " (Yuma: 2600 → 1900 LP). Kaze then activates the effect of "Blade Armor Ninja" ("Blade": 1 → 0 ORU) to allow it to attack again. "Blade Armor Ninja" attacks and destroys "Dododo Warrior" (Yuma: 1900 → 1500 LP). 
 As he controls a face-up "Ninja" monster, Kaze activates his face-down " Armor Ninjitsu Art of Rust Mist ", which will halve the ATK of all  Special Summoned  monsters Yuma controls as long as it remains face-up and Kaze controls a "Ninja" monster. As a " Gagaga " monster he controls was destroyed by battle and sent to the Graveyard, Yuma activates his face-down "Gagagaback" to revive "Gagaga Magician" ( 4/1500 → 750/1000) and "Dododo Warrior" ( 6/2300 → 1150/900) in Attack Position (as they were destroyed in battle this turn) and take 600  damage  for each monster revived this way (Yuma: 1500 → 300 LP). 
 Turn 5: Yuma 
Yuma draws " Gagagabolt " and subsequently activates it to destroy "Blade Armor Ninja" (as he controls a "Gagaga" monster). "Gagaga Magician" attacks  directly  (Kaze: 4000 → 3250 LP). "Dododo Warrior" attacks directly. Due to the second effect of "Dododo Warrior", it is not affected by the effects of Kaze's cards when it attacks ("Dododo Warrior": 1150 → 2300 ATK). Kaze then activates the effect of "Aqua Armor Ninja" from his Graveyard,  banishing  it in order to  negate  the attack, however it doesn't work, so the attack continues (Kaze: 3250 → 950 LP). Yuma Sets a card.
 Turn 6: Kaze 
 
                 No. 12 Armored Ninja - Crimson Shadow   " Number 12: Crimson Shadow Armor Ninja " is Summoned.     
 Kaze draws " Armor Ninjitsu Art of Alchemy " and subsequently activates it to destroy "Armor Ninjitsu Art of Rust Mist" and "Armor Ninjitsu Art of Freezing" ("Gagaga Magician": 750 → 1500 ATK, "Dododo Warrior": 1150 → 2300 ATK) and draw two cards (as the destroyed cards are "Ninjitsu Art" cards). 
 As he controls no monsters and Yuma does, Kaze Special Summons " Earth Armor Ninja " ( 5/1600/1200) from his hand in Attack Position via its own effect. Kaze then activates " Armor Ninjitsu Art of Revival " to revive " Flame Armor Ninja " ( 4/1700/1000) in Attack Position (as it's a "Ninja" monster). Since "Flame Armor Ninja" was Special Summoned, Kaze activates its effect to increase its Level by one ("Flame":   4 → 5). Kaze overlays "Earth Armor Ninja" and "Flame Armor Ninja" in order to  Xyz Summon  " Number 12: Crimson Shadow Armor Ninja " ( 5/2400/1700, ORU: 2) in Attack Position. 
 "Crimson Shadow Armor Ninja" attacks "Gagaga Magician", but Yuma activates his face-down " Guts Guard " to change the  attack target  to "Dododo Warrior" and prevent its destruction by battle this turn (Yuma: 300 → 200 LP).
 Turn 7: Yuma 
Yuma draws " Decrease " and subsequently activates it to target "Dododo Warrior" and reduce its Level by two until the End Phase ("Dododo Warrior":   6 → 4). Yuma overlays "Gagaga Magician" and "Dododo Warrior" in order to Xyz Summon " Number 39: Utopia " ( 4/2500/2000, ORU: 2) in Attack Position. 
 "Utopia" attacks "Crimson Shadow Armor Ninja", but Kaze activates the effect of "Crimson Shadow Armor Ninja" to detach an Overlay Unit ("Crimson Shadow": 2 → 1 ORU) and prevent his monster's destruction (Kaze: 950 → 850 LP). As "Utopia" attacked "Crimson Shadow Armor Ninja" and failed to destroy it in battle, Yuma activates " Revenge Attack " to allow "Utopia" to attack again and increase its ATK by 1000 ("Utopia": 2500 → 3500 ATK). "Utopia" attacks and destroys "Crimson Shadow Armor Ninja" (Kaze: 850 → 0 LP).
 
 Errors 
 In the Japanese version, " Dododo Warrior " has no  Level  on its card.
