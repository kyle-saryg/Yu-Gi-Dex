 The  Graveyard  ( 墓 地   Bochi ), abbreviated (in English only) as  GY  in card text from  Starter Deck: Link Strike  onwards, sometimes translated as  Cemetery , and sometimes (unofficially) referred to as the  Graveyard Zone  or simply  Grave , is the name for a player's discard pile.
 The Graveyard is placed directly above the  Deck Zone . When the  Pendulum Zones  were introduced, the Graveyard was shifted to directly above (or above and to the right of) the right Pendulum Zone. However, with the introduction of the  Master Rule 4 , the Pendulum Zones were moved into the Spell & Trap Zones and the Graveyard returned to its original position.

 Mechanics 
 The Graveyard houses  Monster Cards  that are destroyed, tributed or used as material,  Spell  and  Trap  Cards which have been used, and discarded cards. Cards in the Graveyard typically cannot be used anymore, but can be recovered by using cards such as " Monster Reborn " or " Magician of Faith ".
 The contents of either player's Graveyards are  public knowledge , unless a card like " Question " is used. When a player looks through any Graveyards, they may not  shuffle  its contents, nor rearrange the order in which the cards were placed there.
 When a card is placed in the GY, it is placed on top of the pile. If multiple cards are to go there simultaneously, the order may be determined.
 
 In other media 
 In video games, when a card is  activated  or selected for a card  effect  while in the Graveyard, it immediately moves to the top of the Graveyard; this only exists for the purposes of clarification within those video games, and this game mechanic is not used in the OCG or TCG.
 In the anime, cards that return from the Graveyard are sometimes depicted as coming out of a portal, starting in  Yu-Gi-Oh! Zexal . In the  Yu-Gi-Oh! Duel Monsters anime , cards in the Graveyard were placed face-down and they were not public knowledge, as seen for example in  episode 126  where  Marik  could not guess the  bottom monster  in  Joey's  Graveyard because he had not seen it (in the OCG/TCG this was worked into  Question's  effect).
