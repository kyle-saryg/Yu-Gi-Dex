A  Dueltainer , known as an  Entertainment Duelist  (エンターテインメント・デュエリスト  Entāteinmento Dyuerisuto  or エンタメ・デュエリスト  Entame Dyuerisuto ) in the Japanese version, is a new form of  Duelist  in  Yu-Gi-Oh! ARC-V . Dueltainers are prepared to entertain the public with their  Action Duels . So far, as presented by Yuya, it involves a flashy presentation, death-defying acrobatics and a bit of humor, making it seem like a circus act designed to please the audience. However, others such as Jack Atlas, who also views himself as a Dueltainer, believes strength should be used to entertain the crowd and that Yuya's Dueling is self-satisfaction only.
 According to  Yusho Sakaki , impressing the audience is not the essence of the Dueltainer's Duel, but rather the ability to reach the audience's hearts and make those waver. In his opinion, this is what  Dennis McField  lacks, since his Dueling is only flashy. [1] 
 In  Yu-Gi-Oh! VRAINS ,  George Gore  uses Entertainment Duel to entertain his audience, especially the orphans of an orphanage where he came from. [2]
