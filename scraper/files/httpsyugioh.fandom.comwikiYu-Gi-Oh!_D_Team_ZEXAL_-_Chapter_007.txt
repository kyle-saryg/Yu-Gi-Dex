He draws " Heroic Challenger - Night Watchman ". Gauche  Normal Summons  "Heroic Challenger - Night Watchman" (1200/300) in  Attack Position  and  attacks  the  face-down  monster, which is "Gogogo Golem" (1800/1500). The  effect  of "Night Watchman"  destroys  "Gogogo Golem" before  Damage calculation . Gauche Sets a card.
 Turn 3: Yuma 
Yuma Normal Summons "Marauding Captain" (1200/400), and  activates  its effect, Special Summoning "Gagaga Caesar" (1800/600) from his hand. Yuma  Overlays  his 2 monsters to  Xyz Summon  " Melomelody the Brass Djinn " (1400/1600) in Attack Position. It attacks "Night Watchman", but Gauche activates his face-down "Heroic Retribution Sword",  targeting  "Night Watchman"; with that, although "Night Watchman" is destroyed, Yuma takes the same  Battle damage  as Gauche (Gauche 4000 → 3800, Yuma 4000 → 3800), and "Melomelody" is destroyed as well after the damage calculation. Yuma Sets 2 cards.
 Turn 4: Gauche 
Gauche Normal Summons "Heroic Challenger - Double Lance" (1700/900), and uses its effect to Special Summon a second copy from his hand.

He Normal Summons "Gagaga Girl" (1000/800), and then Overlays his 2 monsters to Xyz Summon " Muzurhythm the String Djinn " (1500/1000).
