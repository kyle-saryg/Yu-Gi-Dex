 Speed Summon!! 
 
 "Clash of the Gods!!" , known as  "Battle of God Summoning"  in the Japanese version, is the thirty-eighth chapter of the  Yu-Gi-Oh! R  manga. It was first printed in Japan on June 21, 2007 in  V Jump  magazine. It was later reprinted in volume 5 of Yu-Gi-Oh! R.
 Yugi  Summons " Arcana Knight Joker " rather than an  Egyptian God , but  Yako 's Deck now contains all three " Wicked Gods " and the capability to Summon them with ease. He begins with the Summoning of " The Wicked Eraser ".
 
 Summary 
 Yako  and  Dark Yugi  face off at the Apex Arena, while down below,  Jonouchi  and  Honda  watch over  Anzu , who is still trapped in Yako's machine.  Gekko ,  Kaiba  and  Willa Mette  watch Yako and Dark Yugi, who ready their  Duel Disks  for their Duel, drawing their starting hands. Dark Yugi thinks that he'll free Anzu with his own two hands; and these cards. Yako thinks that Yugi stole Master  Pegasus , and inwardly orders Yugi to return Pegasus to Yako. 
 Dark Yugi tells Yako that he coming, and Yako thinks for him to bring it, as Dark Yugi takes the first turn, drawing and then Summoning " Alpha the Magnet Warrior " in  Defense Position . He Sets a card and ends his turn. 
 Yako draws, and Sets a card of his own, before Summoing " Beast King Barbaros " - a  Level 8  monster. Dark Yugi asks himself if Yako just Summoned an eight-star monster without sacrificing, and Yako explains that "Barbaros" is the greatest of the demigods, the heveanly servants of the Gods, an eight-star monster that can be Summoned without sacrifices. However, without sacrifices, its attack power is lowered to 1900. He declares "Barbaros's" " Tornado Shaper " attack, destroying "Alpha," remarking that even at 1900  ATK , he's still strong enough to defeat Yugi's monster. Dark Yugi responds with his  Trap Card , " Soul Rope ," paying 1000  Life Points , bringing him down to 3000, but allowing him to Summon " King's Knight " from his Deck. Now it's Dark Yugi's turn, and he Summons " Queen's Knight ," activating the effect of "King's Knight" to call forth " Jack's Knight " from his Deck. 
 Gekko is impressed at the speed with which Yugi has gathered three sacrifices to Summon a  God , but Kaiba remains silent. Dark Yugi knows that his monsters can't defeat "Barbaros," so he Sets a card face-down to end his turn. Yako begins his turn, musing on the three face card swordsmen to call a God - but not if his "Beast King" kills them first. He points out that if even one of Yugi's three swordsmen is lost, Yugi can't Summon a God during the next turn. Declaring his  Battle Phase , he attacks with "Beast King Barbaros." Dark Yugi laughs, telling Yako not to fear the Gods. He reveals his face-down card; " Polymerization ," to Yako's shock, and fuses his three face card swordsmen into one. A single sword strike bisects "Barbaros," shield and all, revealing the imperial knight, " Arcana Knight Joker ." The counterattack takes Yako down to 2100 Life Points with one strike. Gekko observes the 3800 ATK "Knight Joker" observing that that move just put Yugi in the lead. 
 Kaiba muses that Yugi gave up on Summoning a God and left the field to a  Fusion Monster , but Yako's Deck is specifically designed for Summoning the  Wicked Gods  at high speed. Just how many turns will Yugi be able to last with that monster? His hair shielding his eyes, Yako asks if Yugi said "don't far the Gods". He gives a shark-like grin, telling Yugi that it's him that should be afraid. He tells him to tremble at the pulse of the Wicked God. He reveals his own face-down Trap Card, " Level Resist Wall ," allowing him to  Special Summon  monsters until their combined star  Level  equal that of the destroyed "Beast King Barbaros." He Special Summons the  Level 1  " Angel 01 ," the  Level 3  " Cassimolar ," and the  Level 4  " Leraje the God of Archery ." Dark Yugi thinks that Yako Summoned three monsters in an instant, but Yako reminds him that he isn't done yet; he also gets to  Normal Summon  on this turn. Dark Yugi is shocked (likely wary of a Wicked God) as Yako Summons " Votis " in Defense Position, ending his turn. Kaiba admits that Yako's impressive; he can't believe Yako managed to Summon four monsters in just one turn. And now, if he has a God card in his hand...
 Dark Yugi draws, and he attacks and destroys "Votis" with "Arcana Knight Joker." Yako laughs, asking if that's all Yugi's got. He still has three monsters. Dark Yugi isn't happy, but Sets a card and he ends his turn. Yako begins to laugh, first giggling, and then laughing madly. Gekko notes that Yako still has three monsters on the field, and now it's his turn. Yako tells Yugi to prepare to feel the terror of the Wicked Gods, and he draws, declaring that it's his turn. Grimly, Dark Yugi wonders if this is it. Yako sacrifices his three monsters, chanting "Accept the blood of the demigods! Consume the sacrifice and become flesh!" before placing the card in his  Duel Disk  - " The Wicked Eraser ." 
 It's Yugi's first face-to-face meeting with the third Wicked God, and he repeats its name in a slow daze. Gekko states that there it is; the dark God brought forth by Yako's spirit. Kaiba observes that this is the third Wicked God, the "Eraser." Yako explains that the "Eraser's" attack points are equal to the number of cards on his opponent's field times 1000. On Yugi's field, right now he has the "Jack," "King," and "Queen" cards making up his Fusion Monster, plus his single face-down card; four cards in all. That means the "Eraser's" attack power is 4000. Laughing, he observes that all he needs to do is breathe to kill Yugi, as "The Wicked Eraser" attacks "Arcana Knight Joker" with "Digestive Breath." Yako smiles, thinking that Yugi's hopes are melting away.
 
 Featured Duel: Dark Yugi vs. Yako Tenma 
 Turn 1: Yugi 
 Dark Yugi   Normal Summons  " Alpha the Magnet Warrior " (1400/1700) in  Defense Position  and  Sets  a card.
 Turn 2: Yako 
 Yako  Sets a card and Normal Summons " Beast King Barbaros " (3000/1200) in  Attack Position  without  Tribute  via its own  effect , with its  ATK  becoming 1900 as a result. "Barbaros"  attacks  and  destroys  "Alpha", with Yugi  activating  his  face-down  " Soul Rope ",  paying  1000  Life Points  (Yugi 4000 → 3000) to  Special Summon  the  Level  4 " King's Knight " (1600/1400) from his  Deck  in Attack Position.
 Turn 3: Yugi 
Yugi Normal Summons " Queen's Knight " (1500/1600) in Attack Position, which activates the effect of "King's Knight", letting him Special Summon " Jack's Knight " (1800/1200) from his Deck in Attack Position. Yugi Sets a card.
 Turn 4: Yako 
"Barbaros" attacks, but Yugi activates his face-down " Polymerization ", fusing "King's Knight", "Queen's Knight" and "Jack's Knight" to  Fusion Summon  " Arcana Knight Joker " (3800/2500) in Attack Position, who becomes the new attack  target . "Barbaros" is destroyed (Yako 4000 → 2100). As one of his  monsters  was destroyed, Yako activates his face-down " Level Resist Wall ", Special Summoning monsters from his hand with total Levels equal to the Level of the destroyed monster. "Barbaros" is Level 8, so Yako Special Summons the Level 1  " Angel 01 " (200/300), the Level 3 " Cassimolar " (1000/1200) and the Level 4 " Leraje the God of Archery " (1800/1600), all in Defense Position. Yako Normal Summons " Votis " (1700/1900) in Defense Position.
 Turn 5: Yugi 
"Arcana Knight Joker" attacks and destroys "Votis". Yugi Sets a card.
 Turn 6: Yako 
Yako Tributes his three monsters to Summon " The Wicked Eraser " (?/?) in Attack Position, who gains 1000 ATK for each card Yugi  controls . Yugi controls "Arcana Knight Joker", who counts as three cards due to its  Fusion Material Monsters  and a Set card. Therefore, its ATK becomes 4000.
 Duel continues in  the next chapter .
