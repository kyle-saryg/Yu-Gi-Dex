However Alexis left after receiving a text message from Jaden. This caused Bastion to become even more envious of Jaden and sought out to Duel him. [1] 
 At a later date, Jaden, Alexis, Bastion and  Syrus Truesdale  discussed  Zane Truesdale , as Syrus read up on him on  Duel Academy News . They were interrupted by Dr. Crowler, who mistakenly thought Syrus failed a test and announced that he was to be expelled. [2]
