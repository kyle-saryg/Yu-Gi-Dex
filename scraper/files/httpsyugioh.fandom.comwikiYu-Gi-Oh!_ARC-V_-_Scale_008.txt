 Summary 
   This summary is currently incomplete. 
 After being tricked into coming to a duel laboratory and asking  Yuto  to let him use their body,  Yuya  tries not to divulge his point of origin to an inquisitive  Sora  who admits that he does not know anything about  Genesis Omega Dragon . Sora proceeds to start their  Action Duel  by setting their location in the whimsical-looking " Candy Park " which conceals some dangerous booby traps as Yuya finds out. Sora manages to get the first  Action Card  after Yuya fails to get it, proceeding to  Fusion Summon  " Frightfur Bear " to the field. Yuya goes on the offense by setting  Enter-Mates  " Ballad " and " Barracuda " on his  Pendulum Scales  to  Pendulum Summon  " Enter-Mate Handsome Liger ",  Yuzu  liking these pretty-boy  Duel Monsters  as they take out Sora's monster. Sora counters by reviving Frightfur Bear with " Frightfur Reborn ", Yuya about to save Handsom Liger by activating a trap when a photograph fluttered into his hands. Yuya sees the picture to be of Sora and a  younger girl 
 Upon noticing the photo in Yuya's hand, Sora breaks down in tears as he reveals that he must beat Yuya for his ailing younger sister whom  Reiji  is holding captive. Conflicted, Yuya allows Sora to destroy his monster before falling on his knees while contemplating how he can Duel knowing that an innocent's life is on the line. It was only then that a voice in Yuya's head berates him for being too gullible and forcefully takes over the youth's body, the voice revealed to be  Yuri . Yuri warns Sora that he is not a bleeding heart like Yuya and personally expresses his indifference if the boy's sister lives or dies.
