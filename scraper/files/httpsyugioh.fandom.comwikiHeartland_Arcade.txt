      The arcade's interior.     
 Heartland Arcade  is a desolate and deserted arcade located near the  Heartland Shopping Mall  in  Heartland City  in  the  Yu-Gi-Oh! ZEXAL  anime. 
 
 History 
 When  Yuma Tsukumo  wanted to challenge  Shark  to a rematch, he along with  Astral ,  Tori Meadows  and  Bronk Stone  went here to find him, but were ambushed and attacked by  Scorch ,  Chills  and their gang. Shark however stopped them from hurting Yuma and his friends. When Yuma asked Shark for a rematch, he refused and walked out. Yuma later went back to here when he kept bothering Shark, but Shark ran away with Yuma following behind [1] 
 After Shark overheard Scorch and Chills and determined that they planned to use he and  Weasel  as scapegoats for their theft, he urged Weasel to flee from the arcade. [2]
