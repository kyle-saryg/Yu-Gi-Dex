 Biography 
 History 
 Tiger was showed as a young girl dueling her younger brother Luke, where she wins. She asked Luke what is his road and why is he dueling. Tiger also learnt all material arts in the world, including all methods of dueling.
 
 Goha 6th Elementary 
 Tiadosia is the president of Goha 7's Music Club. When Yuga, Luke, Romin, Gavin, Seat-bastian and Kaizo went to meet her, she came behind Luke asking him why he is there. She kicked Luke and yelled at him saying to him to call her Tiger, not "big sister." Yuga and co. explained to her that they mistook the competition and they entered in Trumpet Duet Tournament. They begged her to help them to teach them how to play trumpet. Tiadosia agrees, but she insisted to beat with her first, throwing them material arts weapons. But, Yuga insisted them to duel which Tiger agreed. They started their duel. After her loss, she agrees to help them practice the trumpet, tormenting them until they learn how to play the trumpet.
 
 Deck 
 Tiadosia uses a  Wind Music Deck  composed of WIND Warrior monsters based on martial arts equipment and wind instruments. Her Deck is described as efficient, and is capable of quickly assembling a field of high-Level monsters through precise manipulation of her own cards and ATK scores. As a weakness, her strategy holds little in terms of defensive cards.
