 Summary 
 Now with only 800  LP  and both " Royal Cookpal Princess Pudding " and " Royal Cookpal Knight Pasta " on his field,  Reed  activates the effects of his two monsters since monsters were  Special Summoned  to his opponent's side of the field. Declaring " Full House of Full Stomachs ", he has his " Royal Cookpals " force-feed  Olga 's " Glacial Beast Iceberg Narwhal " and  Halil 's " Fire Jinn the Flame Genie of the Lamp ", causing them to swell up.  Nico Smiley  narrates the twist, explaining that Reed had been pushed into a corner, but is now making a comeback; can Halil and Olga's monsters handle the rush of exquisite cuisine? Unfortunately for him, the crowd are still displeased by the lack of the other areas, though Reed's fans see nothing wrong with letting him be in the spotlight.  Yoko  states that they can't allow that; as this is a  Battle Royal , Reed is not the only one who is fighting.  Skip ,  Ally ,  Tate , and  Frederick  are initially pleased, until Yoko begins gushing over  Dennis , shocking the local crowd. The kids, wanting to know what is happening with  Yuya  and  Zuzu , decide to go and see for themselves, running off with Skip in pursuit. Yoko, meanwhile, muses on Halil’s ethnic appeal (in the dub, she mutters that she should've asked them to get Dennis' autograph).
 Tate, Ally, and Frederick run through the halls, followed by Skip, until a staff member stops them, explaining that non-combatants are forbidden from entering the Battle Royal. The kids are shocked that they won’t even be allowed to return home, and  Henrietta Akaba  apologizes, standing down the hall with  Riley . It’s the first time that the  ARC System  has been used outside a stadium, and they don't want any accidents to happen. Skip muses that they are keeping people out to avoid accidents, and Henrietta thanks him for understanding. Then she notices Tate, who she observes is in the finals of the Youth Class. She comments that the match to decide Tate's opponent is about to begin, and the winner will of course be Riley. Riley's hand tightens on his teddy bear. Henrietta states that the Top matches for the Youth and the Senior class are both on schedule, though it's a shame that they can’t be shown here. She reassures them that soon all of the feeds will return and the tournament will continue uninterrupted, and everything will go according to plan. The cryptic statement is noticed by Skip, who repeats it to himself (in the dub, he wonders why he doesn't believe her).
 
         " Odd-Eyes Rebellion Dragon " is Summoned.     
 At the Ancient Ruins area, the yellow-jeweled  Obelisk Force  member declares his turn and draws. He activates the effect of " Ancient Gear Hunting Hound " to inflict 600 damage to Yuya since he controls a monster, knocking Yuya onto his back and reducing his LP to 200.  Aura  yells, "Darling!" and tries to help him, but  Gong  holds her back. She protests that at this rate, Yuya will lose, but Gong is wondering if it's really Yuya (in the dub, he tells her to let Yuya be at this time). Yuya meanwhile gets to his feet and roars in anger, emitting a dark aura.  Claude  and  Declan  are watching from the  Leo Corporation  observation room, Claude wondering what is going on. The terrified Obelisk Force wonder what is up with Yuya, and yell at each other to hurry up and eliminate him. Yuya's eyes widen at the statement, and he declares his turn. He draws while shrouded in darkness, and the shadows burst apart to reveal that he’s drawn " Odd-Eyes Pendulum Dragon ". His eyes flick from the card to his  Pendulum Zones , and he  chants , "Swing once again, pendulum of the soul! Draw an arc of light across the aether!  Pendulum Summon ! Appear now, my monster servant! (Dub: "Your destruction has been assured! My monster is ready to swing into action!")" "Odd-Eyes Pendulum Dragon" appears from the Summoning portal and roars. Gong gasps that Yuya has two  Dragons  on his field. Yuya declares, " Xiangke Magician , who watches over contrast! Unite the stars under your sharp judgement!” He activates the  Pendulum Effect  of "Xiangke Magician", who collects energy on the points of the design on its shield; once per turn, it can give an  Xyz Monster  a  Level  that is equal to its  Rank . The energy becomes a star in a circle, which unleashes three pulses of light that combine and infuse " Dark Rebellion Xyz Dragon " with a Level of  4 . Claude and Gong are shocked at the concept of giving a Level to an Xyz Monster. Next, Yuya chants, " Xiangsheng Magician , who watches over harmony! Fill the heavens with stars using your arcane powers! " He activates the Pendulum Effect of "Xiangsheng Magician"; once per turn he can target one monster to make it the same Level as another monster. "Xiangsheng Magician" fires an arrow at the space between "Odd-Eyes" and "Dark Rebellion", covering them in red and purple energy respectively and making "Dark Rebellion”  Level 7 . Gong and Declan observe that now Yuya has two Level 7 monsters, and Yuya  overlays  the Level 7 "Odd-Eyes" and "Dark Rebellion". He chants, "Dragon of dual-colored eyes, eradicate all enemies who oppose you with your scale of wrath!  Xyz Summon ! Come forth!  Rank 7 ! Dragon with eyes of rage!  Odd-Eyes Rebellion Dragon ! (Dub) "Dragon with blazing, raging eyes! Come and conquer all that stands against you! I Xyz Summon  Odd-Eyes Rebellion Dragon !")" With a snarl, the new Dragon appears with 3000  ATK , causing powerful shockwaves to rock the area. The Obelisk Force gasp that these shockwaves can’t be from the  Standard Dimension . Aura tries to leap for Yuya, but only succeeds in being blown back into Gong by the shockwaves and knocking them both down.
 
         Yugo  arrives in the Arctic Zone.     
 In the Iceberg Area,  Yugo  emerges in surprise from a flash of light on his  Duel Runner . He looks around in surprise, wondering if this is the Ice Age, and then he pulls out his " Clear Wing Synchro Dragon " card, musing that whenever it shines, he gets warped to a random place. Looking around the icy landscape, he wonders if he's traveled to a future where humanity has fallen to an icy wasteland. Then he notices  Nagi  and  Taka , and he waves, yelling at them. They mistake him for Yuya, irritating Yugo at his name being mistaken immediately, and he tells them that his name is Yugo (that last part is cut from the dub).
 Back at the Ancient Ruins, Yuya explains that when "Odd-Eyes Rebellion Dragon" is Xyz Summoned using "Dark Rebellion Xyz Dragon" treated as Level 7, it can destroy all of his opponent's Level 7 or lower monsters and deal damage equal to their ATK. "Odd-Eyes Rebellion Dragon" lets out a roar that destroys the three "Ancient Gear Hunting Hound"s as they try to retreat, and the Obelisk Force all take 1000 damage, lowering the red-jeweled member to 1500 LP and his fellows to 3000. Yuya then explains that furthermore, by using an Overlay Unit, "Odd-Eyes Rebellion Dragon" can attack equal to the number of times that monsters were destroyed this turn. Gong, shielding Aura, is shocked at the effect, and "Odd-Eyes Rebellion Dragon" absorbs one of its Overlay Units into its maw as Yuya explains that since three monsters were destroyed, he can attack all three of the Obelisk Force. The struts that make up the wings of "Odd-Eyes Rebellion Dragon" open up, generating energy beams to spread its wings, and Yuya tells it to get the Obelisk Force. "Odd-Eyes Rebellion Dragon" plunges its tusks into the ground and flies forwards, ripping up the road and attacking with "Sweeping Static Strike". "Odd-Eyes Rebellion Dragon" rips its tusks from the ground to strike the Obelisk Force, knocking them down and reducing their LP to zero.
 In the Leo Corporation observation room, the view of the Duel is interrupted by a high-level  Synchro Summoning  reading from the Iceberg Area. Even Declan is caught off guard by the announcement. 
 The person responsible for the reading, Yugo, sits astride his Duel Runner, asking the defeated Ken and Taka where he is. But the unconscious  Bandit Warrior Academy  students don't respond, and Yugo protests that they were the ones who attacked him. He takes off his helmet again, and he calls out for someone else.
 Yuya turns away from the defeated Obelisk Force and walks towards a temple, darkness still emanating from his body. Gong lets go of Aura and he wonders what is happening inside it. An explosion of particles echoes out from inside the temple, knocking  Shay  to the edge of the stairs. Gong is shocked to see Shay, and he wonders if Yuya is going to Duel him. Then he notices a weakened pillar crumbling beside where Yuya is walking towards, and he yells his friend's name as he runs forwards and dives on him. Aura covers her eyes in horror, and peeks out to see that Gong has pinned Yuya down to the ground while at the same time taken the weight of the pillar on his back. Yuya begins screaming and struggling, and Gong yells at Aura to hurry and go and get someone. Aura agrees and runs off in terror as Yuya continues to scream.
 Reed declares the finish and he continues the effects of his monsters; by returning "Knight Pasta" and "Princess Pudding" to his hand, he can destroy one monster his opponent controls for each card returned. Both "Fire Jinn" and "Iceberg Narwhal" explode, and then Reed activates his  Trap Card , " Metabolic Storm ", which when he destroys monsters through the effects of his "Royal Cookpal"s, inflicts the ATK of the destroyed monsters as damage. The storm blasts the increasingly worried Halil and Olga over, and Reed bows politely, hoping that they come dine with him again ("You've been served!" in the dub) as their LP falls to zero.  Trout  congratulates Reed on the win, and he greedily tells Halil and Olga to hand over their Pendulum Cards. Neither Halil or Olga are impressed given that Trout didn't even Duel, but they hand the cards over regardless. Trout states that he’s looking forward to working with Reed, calling him "partner", but turns to see Reed talking to Aura, having just been informed of Yuya's current state. Aura notices Trout and snaps at him to come if he’s Reed's partner. Trout's confused reaction is cut off by the stream being stopped in the LID Center Court, infuriating the crowd, especially Reed’s fans after his win. Poor Nico Smiley can only offer a cobbled together explanation that a non-participant or a fan seems to have snuck into the Battle Royal. Yoko, however, remembers Aura from when she visited their house, and that she had mentioned Yuya.
 The Leo Corporation is unable to find Yugo, but Declan knows that the Duelist, who must have been from the  Synchro Dimension , is likely the "Pawn of Fusion" that Shay spoke of. He orders his staff to find the Duelist, and the he asks Claude to update him regarding Yuya. Claude explains that Yuya has been moved to the Jungle Area by the people who found him.
 
         Aura  sees two souls in Yuya.     
 Birds flee from the Jungle Area as Yuya screams, thrashing his head while Gong, Reed, and Trout pin his limbs to the ground, while the darkness that surrounded him has retreated. Reed asks how Yuya got like this, and Gong replies that he doesn't know; it's like Yuya is possessed. Trout nervously tells Gong no to describe it like that, but Yuya leans over and bites Trout's hand (fortunately through his glove), causing Trout to let go with a scream, receiving an uppercut from Yuya as the coup de grace before he grabs Yuya's wrist again. (Trout's injuries are cut from the dub.) Trout asks why he has to go through this, since he's not Reed's friend. Reed agrees, as he had only stayed with Trout because he’d thought that he would be able to improve his skills by Dueling many opponents. Now, he asks Trout to help him help Yuya. Trout asks how they would even do that, and Aura holds her crystal apple out over Yuya's head, explaining that first they need to determine what is possessing Yuya. Trout asks if she can do that, and Aura explains that she’s the number one student at  her school . She looks inside Yuya's soul, seeing  two souls  inside him, and something else deeper that is trying to overwhelm the other two. The others are surprised, and they ask what it is. Aura gasps that she doesn't know, but it is a very terrifying existence. Trout asks them not to scare him; and then Yuya bolts upright with a scream, before gasping and falling unconscious.
 Claude receives an update regarding  Celina , whom the Fuma Ninja have captured and brought to the Iceberg Area. Declan mutters Celina's name.
 Sun Shadow ,  Moon Shadow , and Zuzu walk through the Iceberg Area, with Celina slung over Sun's back and nosily telling him to let her go, protesting that she didn't need his help. Sweatdropping, Sun eventually complies and releases her. Celina asks who the ninja are, since it doesn't seem like they're working with the Obelisk Force. Ignoring her, Sun tells Moon that he'll leave the situation here to them as there may be more nearby, and Sun will go back to check the other situation in the Volcano Area. Moon replies in the affirmative, and Sun speeds away. Zuzu asks Moon who the Obelisk Force were, and Moon explains that from what he's been told, they are from  Duel Academy  in the  Fusion Dimension . Shocked that Celina is being pursued by the Fusion Dimension, Zuzu decides that she must be  Lulu  after all, and she asks if she escaped on her own. Celina cuts her off by introducing herself, admitting that it’s true that the Obelisk Force are out to capture her, but she won't let it happen; even without Moon's help, she would have fended them off by herself. Moon scoffs and turns away. Zuzu asks why they are after her, and Celina replies that it's obvious; they are obeying the orders of  the Professor . She explains that in Duel Academy, the orders of the Professor are absolute and they are not allowed to disobey them. But Celina did, in order to prove her own power. If she eliminates the remnants ("fugitives" in the dub) of the Xyz Dimension in the  Standard Dimension , the Professor will regret not sending her to the front lines. Zuzu asks if that's why Celina Dueled Dennis, and Celina admits that she had the wrong idea about them. Eavesdropping from behind an ice wave on top of a nearby building, Dennis laughs to himself that he told her so. Zuzu realizes that Celina is from Duel Academy, and that by the front lines she means the Xyz Dimension and Celina confirms it. She laments that all of her comrades went to the Xyz Dimension and were able to display their skills honorably, but Celina alone was to stay behind as per the Professor's orders.
 Zuzu asks if Celina even knows what Duel Academy did to the Xyz Dimension. Celina doesn't reply, so Zuzu explains that  Heartland , Lulu's homeland, was a peaceful place until the day that Duel Academy invaded, and she remembers Shay's explanation of the day. She explains that she heard that the members of Duel Academy laughed as if they were taking part in a hunting game.
 Meanwhile, Shay faces off against  Sora  in the temple, his previous attack having failed. Sora sneers at him while Shay grits his teeth.
 In the Volcano Area, Sun stops on a rock to see  Kev Ravenwood  and two of the Senior Team facing off against three of the Obelisk Force, who all control "Ancient Gear Hunting Hound", while Kev controls " Hierophant of Prophecy ", and his fellows control " Naturia Leodrake " and " Perfectly Ultimate Great Moth ". Sun wonders where the other three of the six Duel Academy soldiers are.
 
         Zuzu  attempts to convince  Celina  of  Duel Academy 's actions.     
 By the time Zuzu has finished her tale, the sun is setting and Dennis is still in hiding. Celina scoffs, calling it ridiculous that proud warriors of Duel Academy would laugh as if it were a game. Zuzu asks if they are lying, and Celina explains that Duel Academy has a noble objective; to make the  four worlds  become one. The invasion of the Xyz Dimension was for that purpose, and eventually they will assimilate the Synchro Dimension and the Standard Dimension. All of the Duelists of Duel Academy were trained for that purpose, and prideful warriors like that would never do such things. Zuzu angrily asks what pride there is in bringing people grief, and Celina asks what they have to grieve over (the part where Celina asks what they have to grieve over is cut from the dub). The Xyz Duelists should have their own pride as well; even if they lost, if they fought with their all, they should be able to accept the consequences… Zuzu angrily grabs Celina by the shoulders, asking if she is telling them to accept it when their friends and families are hurt as well. Celina is confused, asking if the friends and families of the Xyz Duelists aren't Duelists themselves. Zuzu closes her eyes, explaining that Shay and Yuto are trying to rescue Lulu, Shay's little sister, from Duel Academy. Celina is surprised at this, and Zuzu states that Shay is the Xyz remnant that Celina is after, so if Celina doesn't believe Zuzu, she should go and confirm it with Shay.
 In the Jungle Area, Reed spoons some soup into Yuya's mouth. Yuya slowly wakes up to see Gong, Reed, and Trout staring down at him. Reed and Gong call his name, while Trout complains that he's had enough of occult things for one night. Yuya murmurs their names, and then Aura leans over him, calling him "Darling". Yuya is surprised to see Aura, and Aura cheers that Yuya is back to normal before tightly hugging him around the neck. 
 Later, Trout claims that the reason that Yuya got back to normal was because of his help; the soup that he just drank was made from fish that Trout caught from the sea. He claims that while he doesn't need thanks, if Yuya insists, he can give him all of his Pendulum Cards - and then he snaps, having only just realized that everyone is ignoring him as they listen to Yuya around a campfire. (Trout's attempts to swindle Yuya's Pendulum Cards are cut from the dub.) Yuya admits that the last thing that he remembers is the guys from Duel Academy showing up, turning the  Knights   of the   Duel Disks  into cards. Gong and Reed are shocked by the revelation that defeated Duelists are sealed into cards, and Yuya asks if he defeated the Obelisk Force. Gong explains that he did, by Xyz Summoning a dragon that he'd never seen before. The mention surprises Yuya. Aura, meanwhile, is examining Yuya through her crystal apple again, lamenting that she just can't see it; Yuya seems to be the normal Yuya. She explains to him that she previously saw another soul in him, and something else, a dark shadowy thing. Reed finds it hard to believe, and he asks if Aura mistook what she saw. Aura protests that she didn't, but then admits that she can't say for sure. The mention of another soul sparks something in Yuya, and he pulls out the "Dark Rebellion Xyz Dragon" card, wondering if Yuto's soul is inside him. He realizes that the visions that he saw were the people of the Xyz Dimension, and that it was Yuto's anger that drove Yuya into his rage. And yet despite that, Yuto entrusted the "Dark Rebellion Xyz Dragon" card to Yuya telling him to bring smiles with his Dueling, but why?
 Back at the Iceberg Area, Celina nods, stating that she'll meet with Shay and confirm if what Zuzu said is true. Zuzu nods, and then she excitedly suggests that they switch clothes. Celina is confused, and Zuzu points out that it would be a hassle if Duel Academy found Celina before she could find Shay. Celina realizes that Zuzu means to act as her double in order to draw the Obelisk Force away and Zuzu confirms it. Celina prepares to strip off her jacket, and Zuzu protests vehemently. Celina asks what she means, and Zuzu shoots a glare at Moon's back, before telling Celina not to give her that, leading the confused girl behind a rock to change. She tells Moon not to look, and Moon stiffly agrees; as does the eavesdropping Dennis, who turns away and closes his eyes. (Zuzu's issues with Celina changing in the open, especially the part where she tells Moon not to look are removed from the dub.) Soon the two girls have switched clothes, retaining their hairstyles and ribbons,  their   bracelets  and their Duel Disks. Zuzu explains that Shay wasn't in the Jungle Area or the Volcano Area, so that only leaves the Ancient Ruins Area, Celina finishes. Nodding at one another, the two girls run off in different directions.
 Dennis watches them go, and a light shines out in front of him. He turns to the light and smiles, commenting that it's just him? He tells  Yuri  that he's finally arrived.
