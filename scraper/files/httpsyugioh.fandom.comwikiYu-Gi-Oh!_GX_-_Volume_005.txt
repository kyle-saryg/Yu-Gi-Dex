 This section, or a part of it, has been transcluded from  Yu-Gi-Oh! GX - Volume 001 ; any changes involving it should be made  there  instead.  /  
 Years after Yugi's legendary battles, the game is so popular that special institutions dedicated to the art of the Duel have sprung up all over the world. Join Jaden Yuki and his pals at the Academy for the adventures of the next generation of "Yu-Gi-Oh!" [1] 
 Hero vs. Dragon 
 It's the ultimate grudge match between Duel Academy's most promising students, Jaden and Chazz! Can Jaden's Elemental Heroes defeat the overwhelming power of Chazz's dragon deck? As the entire student body watches the match, no one notices another duel taking place in a dark, abandoned building on the other end of the island. It's a Shadow Game, and the stakes are more than honor—they're life and death! [2] 
 
 The Story So Far 
 On an island in the southern sea there is an academy that trains the next generation of duelists—the Duel Academy! 
 Jaden Yuki learned about the excitement of dueling through an encounter with the World Dueling Champion, Koyo Hibiki. Entrusted with Hibiki's deck, Jaden takes on all challengers at the Academy in order to become a true duelist! At Duel Academy, he makes friends, including Alexis Rhodes, Syrus Truesdale and Bastion Misawa. But he also meets fierce rivals, such as Chazz Princeton. 
 When Syrus's older brother Zane "Kaiser" Truesdale, the current World Champion Duelist, returns from America, the Academy holds a tournament for the right to challenge him. Soon, the tournament comes down to a battle between Jaden and Chazz. But American exchange student Reggie has come to the Academy for a much more sinister reason that just winning…she is searching for the mysterious "sprit cards," such as Jaden's Winged Kuriboh. And Reggie herself is the just the servant for a much darker force lurking within the heart of the cards…! [2] 
 
 In the Next Volume… 
 It's dragon breath vs cyborg steel as the fiery duel between Chazz and Zane continues! Meanwhile, away from the spotlight and roar of the crowd, Jaden gives his all in a desperate duel to save Miss Hibiki from Reggie's dark magic! Then four new faces arrive at Duel Academy, and one of them conceals a terrible secret…
