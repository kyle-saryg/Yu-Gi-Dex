 Summary 
 Despite being at the mercy of  Kaiba 's " Blue-Eyes Ultimate Dragon ",  Yugi  forms a counter defense by  Summoning  " Kuriboh " and  activating  " Multiply ". This creates a wall of "Kuribohs" that no  monster  can penetrate. Yugi then uses " Living Arrow " and " Polymerization " to  fuse  " Mammoth Graveyard " with Kaiba's "Blue-Eyes Ultimate Dragon". This causes the dragon to rot and decay, reducing its  ATK  by 1200 at the end of Yugi's  turns . Its ATK soon falls to 900, so even Yugi's weakest monsters can  destroy  it. Kaiba becomes distressed; he knows he is going to lose.
 Kaiba starts to believe he has failed his brother. He has a vision where  Mokuba  is being sucked into the melting "Blue-Eyes Ultimate Dragon". Kaiba's younger self tries and fails to rescue him and then scolds present-day Kaiba for not looking after Mokuba. Kaiba feels himself rotting, just like his dragon.
 Yugi destroys one of the Dragon's heads with " Celtic Guardian " (Bakura states that the reason for this was because "Blue-Eyes Ultimate Dragon" is made up of three monsters and thus each head is a target and has its own amount of ATK, which they all shared at the timing), and another  attack  will defeat Kaiba. In desperation, Kaiba moves to the edge of the castle. The force of Yugi's next attack could knock him over the edge and kill him (rare dub death mention). Kaiba resurrects the  dragon head  that was destroyed. This means he can defeat Yugi's Celtic Guardian and win the Duel, but only if Yugi skips his next move. Yugi and  Yami Yugi  have a conflict over risking Kaiba's life for that of his  grandpa . Yami Yugi launches the attack anyway, but  Téa  convinces him to call it off. With everything he has, Yugi regains control and pushes Yami out. 
 Yugi, having returned to his normal self, is upset over losing and frightened of Yami Yugi's power over him, who was willing to kill in order to win. Kaiba attempts to mock Yugi, but Téa scolds him. Kaiba leaves, victorious but angry.
 
 Featured Duel: Yami Yugi vs. Seto Kaiba 
 
 This Duel uses  Duelist Kingdom  gameplay. Rules and  card effects  may differ from that of the  TCG / OCG . See the individual card articles for more information.     
 Duel continues from the previous episode . 
 Yugi  has 400  LP  remaining and  controls  no cards. His  hand  contains " Mammoth Graveyard ", " Polymerization " and " Multiply ". 
 Kaiba  has 900 LP remaining and  controls  " Blue-Eyes Ultimate Dragon " (4500/3800) in  Attack Position .
 Turn 18: Yami Yugi 
Yugi  draws  " Kuriboh " and subsequently Normal Summons it (300/200) in  Defense Position . Yugi then  activates  " Multiply " to create a  wall  of "Kuribohs" to protect his  Life Points .
 Turn 19: Kaiba 
"Blue-Eyes Ultimate Dragon"  attacks  the "Kuriboh" wall, but fails to  destroy  it. The "Kuriboh" wall regenerates itself.
 Turn 20: Yami Yugi 
Yugi draws " Living Arrow " and subsequently activates it along with " Polymerization " in order to  fuse  "Mammoth Graveyard" to "Blue-Eyes Ultimate Dragon". Since "Blue-Eyes Ultimate Dragon" is a living  monster , it cannot properly fuse with the  undead  "Mammoth Graveyard", so it loses  ATK  equal to the ATK of "Mammoth Graveyard" during each of Yugi's End Phases. On Yugi's  End Phase , "Blue-Eyes Ultimate Dragon" loses 1200 ATK ("Blue-Eyes Ultimate Dragon": 4500 → 3300/3800).
 Turn 21: Kaiba 
"Blue-Eyes Ultimate Dragon" attacks the "Kuriboh" wall, but fails to destroy it. The "Kuriboh" wall then regenerates itself.
 Turn 22: Yami Yugi 
Yugi draws, then passes his turn. "Blue-Eyes Ultimate Dragon" loses 1200 more ATK ("Blue-Eyes Ultimate Dragon": 3300 → 2100/3800).
 Turn 23: Kaiba 
"Blue-Eyes Ultimate Dragon" attacks the "Kuriboh" wall, but fails to destroy it. The "Kuriboh" wall then regenerates itself.
 Turn 24: Yami Yugi 
Yugi passes his turn. "Blue-Eyes Ultimate Dragon" loses 1200 more ATK ("Blue-Eyes Ultimate Dragon": 2100 → 900/3800). 
 Turn 25: Kaiba 
Kaiba passes his turn.
 Turn 26: Yami Yugi 
Yugi draws "Celtic Guardian" and subsequently Normal Summons it (1400/1200) in Attack Position. "Celtic Guardian" attacks "Blue-Eyes Ultimate Dragon", however it only manages to destroy the middle head since "Blue-Eyes Ultimate Dragon" was a  fusion  of three monsters and each of their heads share the same ATK (Kaiba: 900 → 400 LP). Yugi intends to destroy another head on his next turn to win the  Duel .
 Turn 27: Kaiba 
Kaiba moves to the edge of the tower and claims the destruction of his monster might blow him off (in the original, he threatens to jump off) if  Yami Yugi  attacks. Kaiba draws " Reborn the Monster " and subsequently activates it to revive the middle head of "Blue-Eyes Ultimate Dragon" by  Special Summoning  " Blue-Eyes White Dragon " (3000/2500) from his  Graveyard  in Attack Position. (NOTE: In the Japanese version, Kaiba explains that since the revived monster is fused to the rotting dragon, it can't attack this turn.)
 Turn 28: Yami Yugi 
"Celtic Guardian" attacks one of the decayed heads of "Blue-Eyes Ultimate Dragon", however  Yugi Muto  cancels the attack at the last moment, because he is unable to watch Kaiba fall to his death.
 Turn 29: Kaiba 
"Blue-Eyes White Dragon" attacks and destroys "Celtic Guardian" (Yugi: 400 → 0 LP).
 
 Differences in adaptations 
 " Multiply " is given a slight modification in the dub. 
 In the Japanese version, when "Blue-Eyes Ultimate Dragon" attacks the "Kuriboh" wall, Yugi explains that "Kuribohs"  self-destruct  on contact with enemy attacks, and the resulting shockwaves prevent the attack from reaching the other "Kuribohs". 
 In the Japanese version, when Yugi takes back control of his body from Yami Yugi, he has has no dialogue and simply cries. This is strange as "Celtic Guardian" stops its attack without any prompting. In the dub, Yugi yells "stop!", which causes his monster to cease its attack. 
 In the dub,  Kaiba  says the attack against "Blue-Eyes Ultimate Dragon" could cause him to fall off of the tower, whilst in the Japanese, he says he will just simply walk backward for every 100 LP lost and commit suicide if Yugi wins. 
 Errors/Mistakes 
 In the dub, after Yugi fuses "Mammoth Graveyard" with "Blue-Eyes Ultimate Dragon", Yugi says that his card is an Undead- Type  monster. The Zombie Type is known as the Undead Type in the original Japanese. 
 In the original Japanese version, Yugi states that "Blue-Eyes Ultimate Dragon" is a light attribute monster and "Mammoth Graveyard" is a dark attribute. By fusing them together, he states that the "two Attributes oppose each other" causing the body of "Blue-Eyes Ultimate Dragon" to decay and lose attack points. This reasoning incorrect as "Mammoth Graveyard" is an earth attribute monster, not dark attribute.
