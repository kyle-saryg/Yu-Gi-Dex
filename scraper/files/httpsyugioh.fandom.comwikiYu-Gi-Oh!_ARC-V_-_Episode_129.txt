 Featured Duel: Yuya Sakaki and Declan Akaba vs. Leo Akaba 
 Duel continues from the previous episode . 
 Turn 4: Yuya 
The effect of " Performapal Gatlinghoul " has just been activated to destroy " Spirit Tech Force - Pendulum Governor ". Due to the effect of " Spirit Reactor ", as there is an  EARTH ,  WATER ,  WIND  or  FIRE  monster on the field, each  monster   Leo   controls  cannot be destroyed once per turn.  Declan  controls the WIND " D/D/D Gust King Alexander " and the WATER " D/D/D Wave King Caesar ", so "Pendulum Governor" is not destroyed.  Yuya   Sets  a card.
 Turn 5: Declan 
Declan  Tributes  "Alexander" and "Caesar" to  Tribute Summon  " D/D/D Doom King Armageddon " (3000/1000). The effect of "Caesar" activates as it was sent to the  Graveyard , allowing Declan to add 1 " Dark Contract " card from his Deck to his hand. He adds " Deceitful Dark Contract with the War Deity " and subsequently activates it. Declan activates the first effect of "Illegal Dark Contract with the War Deity", targeting a monster he controls and one his opponent controls. He targets "Armageddon" and Leo's "Spirit Tech Force - Pendulum Governor". During the  Battle Phase , the  ATK  of his monster will increase by 1000 and the ATK of his opponent's monster will decreased by 1000. "Armageddon" attacks "Pendulum Governor" (as "Armageddon" is a  Level 8   Pendulum Monster , it is not prevented from attacking by the effects of "Pendulum Governor"), but Leo activates his Set " Dis-Swing Fusion ", negating the attack since a Pendulum Monster is attacking and then taking control of the attacking monster, preventing it from being destroyed by card effects. The second effect of "Dis-Swing Fusion" allows Leo to ignore one of the  Fusion Materials  of a  Fusion Monster  and use monsters in his hand or on his field as the remaining Fusion Materials to  Fusion Summon  that Fusion Monster. Leo fuses "Pendulum Governor" to Fusion Summon " Master Spirit Tech Force - Pendulum Ruler " (3500/3000). As a monster was  Special Summoned , Yuya activates his Set " Twin Big Shields ", preventing 1 monster he controls from being destroyed by battle or card effects twice per turn. He targets "Gatlinghoul".
 Turn 6: Leo 
Leo  Pendulum Summons  " Spirit Gem - Silpheed Core " from his hand (0/0) and " Spirit Gem - Salamander Core " from his  Extra Deck . As "Salamander Core" was Pendulum Summoned from the Extra Deck, Leo can activate its effect to return it to the hand, and he does so. Leo activates the effect of "Pendulum Ruler", letting him  Tribute  a " Spirit Gem " monster that was Pendulum Summoned from the hand this  turn  that has not activated its effect to allow "Pendulum Ruler" to use that card's effect up to twice this turn and double any effect damage inflicted by this effect. He Tributes "Silpheed Core". He activates the effect now, letting him  destroy  a  Spell / Trap Card  on the field and inflict  damage  800 to its controller. He destroys "Twin Big Shields" (Yuya: 3200 → 1600) and "Deceitful Dark Contract with the War Deity" (Declan: 3200 → 1600). "Pendulum Ruler" attacks and destroys "Gatlinghoul". (Yuya: 1600 → 1000) "Armageddon" attacks directly, but Yuya finds and activates the  Action Card  " Evasion ", negating the attack.
 Turn 7: Yuya 
Yuya Pendulum Summons " Odd-Eyes Pendulum Dragon " (2500/2000) and " Performapal U Go Golem " (1600/1000) from his Extra Deck and " Performapal Nightmare Knight " (1700/0) from his hand. Yuya  overlays  the  Level 4  "U Go Golem" and "Nightmare Knight" to  Xyz Summon  " Dark Rebellion Xyz Dragon " (2500/2000). Yuya activates " The Phantom Knights of Possession ", letting him treat an  Xyz Monster  he controls as having a  Level  equal to the Level of a monster on the field. He treats "Dark Rebellion" as having the same Level as "Odd-Eyes". Yuya  overlays  his two Level 7  Dragon - Type  monsters to  Xyz Summon  " Odd-Eyes Raging Dragon " (3000/2500) in Attack Position.
 Yuya activates the effect of "Raging Dragon",  detaching  all of its  Overlay Units  to negate the effects of as many  face-up  Spell/Trap Cards as possible and then destroying all other cards on the field, with "Raging Dragon" gaining 200 ATK for each destroyed card. He destroys both "Spirit Reactors", " Stargazer Magician ", " Timegazer Magician ", " D/D Cerberus ", " D/D Savant Copernicus " and " Dark Contract with Exclusivity ". The effect of "Pendulum Ruler" prevents itself from being destroyed. As he destroyed 7 cards, "Raging Dragon" gains 1400 ATK ("Raging Dragon": 3000 → 4400) "Raging Dragon" attacks and destroys "Armageddon". As Leo would take battle damage involving "Armageddon", it will be inflicted to Declan as per as the effect of " Dis-Swing Fusion " (Declan: 1600 → 200). "Raging Dragon" attacks and destroys "Pendulum Ruler" (Leo: 1600 → 700) Yuya activates the effect of "Performapal Nightmare Knight", banishing it from his Graveyard to inflict 1000 damage to all players who took  battle damage  this turn.
 At this point,  Yusho  enters the Duel and takes the intrusion penalty (Yusho: 4000 → 2000 LP). By sending all cards in his hand to the Graveyard, Yusho activates " Restraining Sword of Impact " and ends the Battle Phase.
 Since "Restraining Sword of Impact" was an illegal card, the Duel gets canceled.

 English Adaption 
 When Yusho enters the Duel, Riley's body is edited out of the dub. 
 Interestingly, the scene of Yuya and Zuzu, both shown naked from the chest up, aren't edited out, making this one of the few instances of nudity that isn't censored in the adaption.
