 Lyrics 
 Check it out! 
It's time to make your move. 
Never has a moment felt so right. 
 No doubt! 
It's down to me and you. 
Movin' faster than the speed of light! 
I can feel my engine pumpin' faster, faster! 
Ragin' with an appetite for turbo speed!
 I can’t stop till ya see what I’ve got 'cuz I was born to be a winner! 
Take a good look, my game is off the hook 'cuz 
I am no beginner.
 Lean and mean listen to my machine kickin' into overdrive! 
We were born to ride! 
We ride to survive! 
Yeah!
