 The sheet music in this card’s artwork appears in the artwork of “ Score the Melodious Diva ”.
 Both cards are based on sheet music, also known as a Musical Score, which is a handwritten or printed form of music notation that uses modern musical symbols to indicate the pitches (melodies), rhythms or chords of a song or instrumental musical piece. 
 In music, a Solo is a piece or a section of a piece played or sung featuring a single performer, who may be performing completely alone or supported by an accompanying instrument such as a piano or organ, a continuo group (in Baroque music), or the rest of a choir, orchestra, band, or other ensemble. Performing a solo is "to solo", and the performer is known as a soloist.
 This is fitting for the card’s design, as it requires you to control no other monsters to activate its effect.
