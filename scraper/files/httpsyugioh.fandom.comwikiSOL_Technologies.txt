 SOL Technologies  is an organization that appears in the  Yu-Gi-Oh! VRAINS  anime. They are in charge of  LINK VRAINS .
 They currently seek to capture and dissect all the  Ignis  to create new, high performance Ignis, competing with the  Knights of Hanoi  to obtain them first.
 Ai  takes over the entire company after obtaining the two code keys from  Queen  and  Akira . All the employees were fired and replaced with  SOLtiS  androids. (In the dub, he merely sends them on a severely extended vacation)
 
 Technology 
 As the organization in charge of LINK VRAINS, they have access to technologies that overlook the Cyberspace, including  City Scan  (シティー・スキャン  Shitī Sukyan ) and  Log-Out Prevention  programs.
 
 City Scan 
 City Scan, rather than a technology, is an action to purge cyberspace to search for something. This came at the cost of the security level of cyberspace. The city scan has only been conducted only once so far in order to search for  Ai .
