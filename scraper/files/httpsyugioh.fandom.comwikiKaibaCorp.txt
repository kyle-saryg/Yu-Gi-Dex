 History 
         KaibaCorp HQ     
 The company was originally controlled by its founder,  Gozaburo Kaiba , and originally operated as a military arms manufacturer. When  Seto Kaiba , Gozaburo's eldest adopted son, gained control of the company via a hostile takeover, he drastically reformed it to have it focus exclusively on the gaming industry instead. 
 The corporate headquarters is located in  Domino City  (briefly called " Battle City " when the KaibaCorp-sponsored tournament of the same name took place there). The company's most-prized product is the  Duel Disk , a dueling system which gives the card-based  Duel Monsters  game a holographic interface. The corporation also owns and operates the  Duel Academy  in  Yu-Gi-Oh! GX .
 
         KaibaCorp in  Yu-Gi-Oh! GX     
 KaibaCorp expanded into other areas of the gaming and entertainment industries with the creation of the amusement park Kaibaland. Two parks were built; one in  Domino City  and the other in California in the United States. It was the culmination of the Kaiba brothers' lifelong dream to create a park for orphaned and underprivileged children.
 Seto's rise to power involved direct manipulation of  The Big Five ,  Gozaburo Kaiba , and his brother  Mokuba Kaiba . Due to this, as well as KaibaCorp's past as a weapons company, Seto is often brought to blows with those who have a vendetta against either him or the company. These include the individual members of  The Big Five , Gozaburo Kaiba, and his biological son,  Noah Kaiba .  Alister  of the  Doma arc  also sought revenge for his little brother, who was killed in an attack by a military organization who used artillery funded by KaibaCorp. Later, this attack is revealed to have been ordered by  Dartz , who was masquerading as Gozaburo Kaiba. These clashes have often been the foundation of several story arcs in the series including  Legendary Heroes ,  Waking the Dragons , and  Virtual World .
 
           KaibaCorp in  Yu-Gi-Oh! 5D's .     
 The KaibaCorp building is seen numerous times in  Yu-Gi-Oh! 5D's , with a new design, from aerial views of  New Domino City . In the opening, "Kizuna," " Stardust Dragon " is shown flying up the side of the building. It is unknown who designed the new KaibaCorp and who controls the company as CEO in  5D's .
 KaibaCorp was responsible for turning  Domino City  into New Domino City, as well as the establishment of  Turbo Duels , a type of Duel which is only played by either using a "Duel Runner" or a "Duel Board." The company is mentioned by  Rex Goodwin , who informed  Greiger  that if he succeeded in revealing  Yusei Fudo  as a  Signer , KaibaCorp would fund the revival of his village. 
 During the English dub only, KaibaCorp is also mentioned by  Blister  to Yusei describing how he was offered a contract from KaibaCorp to go into Professional Dueling. The deal would have given him a chance to duel with  Jack Atlas ,  Aster Phoenix , and Truesdale (It is not stated if this meant  Zane Truesdale  or  Syrus Truesdale ).
 
 Relationships with other companies 
 The most notable rival to KaibaCorp is  Schroeder Corp , headed by  Zigfried von Schroeder . The Schroeder family had been rivals of the Kaiba Family even before Seto's takeover. They were also once a military dealer like KaibaCorp, but when the previous CEO went mad, Zigfried took power and changed the company to a games maker: as it would happen, this runs concurrently with Seto's rise to power, and the subsequent reforming of KaibaCorp to become a games company. Schroeder Corp and KaibaCorp both researched and developed holographic projection systems for Duel Monsters, but KaibaCorp's system was patented and marketed first. Zigfried was furious over the fact that Seto always seemed to be one step ahead of him, and until his defeat at the  KC Grand Championship , was obsessed with ruining KaibaCorp.
 Another notable company is  Industrial Illusions , headed by  Maximillion Pegasus . It is important to note that KaibaCorp's technology, especially the Duel Disk, ran seamlessly with the  Duel Monsters game  created by Pegasus, and both companies have previously worked closely together to make this possible. Seto Kaiba and Pegasus are in fact old associates who met when Pegasus was still an active participant in the dueling world, although his bids for the ownership of KaibaCorp have since driven a rift between them. Despite this, Pegasus still (somewhat mockingly) regards Seto Kaiba as a friend, which is not mutual.
 Paradius , run by  Dartz  (the main antagonist of season 4,  Waking the Dragons ) is also a company worthy of mention. Paradius initially owned a small portion of KaibaCorp, but ended up buying it outright.  Alister  bought almost 50% at first, but it's unknown if he used Paradius or Industrial Illusions to do so, as when he tried to buy KaibaCorp, he was posing as Pegasus. It's unknown what happened to Paradius as an organization after Dartz was defeated.
 In  Yu-Gi-Oh! The Falsebound Kingdom , the company  SIC  does similar work to that of KaibaCorp. It is run by  Scott Irvine , a former KaibaCorp employee, who helped develop the  Disk 2  (he can also be seen in the anime). Allegedly a gaming technology company, its true goal was to control the  Egyptian God Cards . 
 Finally, in the  Yu-Gi-Oh! R  manga, which takes place after Battle City and before the  Doma  arc, the Kaiba brothers are in the United States on business. KaibaCorp is attacked by Pegasus' protege,  Yako Tenma , who wants revenge on Yugi for defeating Pegasus. He captures  Téa , and uses her as a vessel to try and use the  Wicked Gods  to bring Pegasus back, believing that  Yugi  had killed him. The Kaiba brothers eventually return and with Yugi, Joey and Seto Kaiba's combined efforts, Tenma and his servants are defeated.

 Trivia 
 KaibaCorp's change from being a military company to a gaming company shares a similarity to the fictional ENCOM company in the  Tron  Franchise. 
 In the 2nd series Anime,  Noah Kaiba  was intended to be the new head of Kaiba Corp after he passed Gozaburo's tests. However, Gozaburo felt that Noah couldn't run Kaiba Corp as Noah was stuck in a virtual world with no body, following his untimely death. He also knew that Noah would remain a spoiled child, since he never aged in the virtual world. 
 In the Yu-Gi-Oh universe, KaibaCorp is a prominent and wealthy company by how it produced and popularized dueling-related paraphernalia beginning with the  Duel Disks , the founding of  Duel Academy  and later the production of  Duel Runners . 
 KaibaCorp seems to have lost its prestige after Zero Reverse, due to funding Ener-D. 
 It appears as a stage in Yu-Gi-Oh! Destiny Board Traveler.           KaibaCorp in Destiny Board Traveler.
