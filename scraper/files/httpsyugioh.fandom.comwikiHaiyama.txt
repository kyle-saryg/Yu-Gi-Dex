 Trivia 
 Haiyama has similarities to both Tomoya Hanasaki and Weevil Underwood, also bearing similar appearances for both his personalities.
 Like Hanasaki, he appeared shy and alone when he was being deceitful. In both cases, Yugi refers to them being how he used to be. 
 Like Weevil, he lied and manipulated others to his own advantage.
