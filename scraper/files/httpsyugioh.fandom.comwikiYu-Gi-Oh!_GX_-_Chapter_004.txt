 "Bastion the Analyst!!" , known as  "A Prodigy Duelist!!"  in the Japanese version, is the fourth chapter of the  Yu-Gi-Oh! GX  manga . It was first printed in Japanese in the  V Jump  magazine and in English in the  Shonen Jump  magazine. Both of which were printed in  volume 1  of the Yu-Gi-Oh! GX graphic novels afterwards.
 In order to get the phone number of  Alexis Rhodes ,  Bastion Misawa  sets a  Duel  with  Jaden Yuki , who wants to borrow a DVD.
 
 Summary 
 In  Duel Academy 's  video room ,  Bastion Misawa , the top duelist of the first-year  Ra Yellows , reviews the footage of  Jaden Yuki 's duel with  Chazz Princeton , and questions what someone with some much talent is doing in  Slifer Red . He also regrets not having been the one to end Chazz's winning streak.  Alexis Rhodes  comes in to ask him what he thinks about Jaden. Bastion describes him as having an uncanny ability to draw the right cards, and that his draws get better and better as the duel goes on. He then describes himself as an "average joe," who succeeds by studying and working hard, while actually describing Jaden as a dueling genius. Suddenly, Alexis' phone rings, and she receives a call from Jaden, who wants to borrow her  Battle City  DVD. Bastion is shocked and jealous to realize that Jaden has Alexis' phone number, and rushes from the computer lab.
 Bastion finds Jaden with  Syrus Truesdale , and Jaden tells him that because he borrows DVDs and other duel-related material from Alexis, they exchanged numbers so she could find him whenever she needed what she had lent. During their conversation, Jaden receives a text message from Alexis, who tells him that she lent the Battle City DVD to someone else. Bastion says he has both Battle City and  Duelist Kingdom  DVDs, the latter of which is very rare, but will only lend them to Jaden if he wins a duel against him, and that if he wins against Jaden, he will get Alexis' contact information.
 They meet outside the Slifer Red dorm to duel, and Jaden tells him that he could just give Bastion Alexis' number without dueling. Bastion declines, citing his pride as the reason, and the two reveal that they had wanted to duel each other for a long time due to respect for each other's skill. Bastion begins the duel, confident that he has an "equation" ready to defeat Jaden.
 
 Featured Duel: Jaden Yuki vs. Bastion Misawa 
 Turn 1: Bastion 
Bastion  Normal Summons  " Fox Fire " (300/200) in  Defense Position  and  Sets  a card.
 Turn 2: Jaden 
Jaden Sets a card, and Normal Summons " Elemental Hero Knospe " (600/1000) in  Attack Position . Jaden  attacks  and  destroys  "Fox Fire" with "Knospe", and Bastion  activates  his  face-down   Continuous Trap Card  " Graveyard of Wandering Souls ", which lets him  Special Summon  a " Fireball Token " for each  monster  sent from his  field  or  hand  to the  Graveyard . Thus, one "Fireball Token" (100/100) is Summoned. During the  End Phase , the effect of "Fox Fire" activates, allowing Bastion to Special Summon it back to the field in Attack Position as it was  destroyed by battle .
 Turn 3: Bastion 
Bastion attacks "Knospe" with "Fox Fire". Jaden activates his face-down " Rose Bud ",  Tributing  "Knospe" to Special Summon " Elemental Hero Poison Rose " (1900/2000) in Attack Position from his  Deck . The attack continues and "Fox Fire" is destroyed (Bastion 4000 → 2400). Bastion activates " Graceful Charity ",  drawing  three cards and then  discarding  two cards from his hand, which were a  Level  4 and a Level 7 monster cards. Due to this discard, and the destruction of "Fox Fire", three "Hinotama Tokens" are Summoned. Bastion Sets two cards, and "Fox Fire" is Special Summoned via its own effect during the End Phase.
 Duel continues in the  the next chapter .
