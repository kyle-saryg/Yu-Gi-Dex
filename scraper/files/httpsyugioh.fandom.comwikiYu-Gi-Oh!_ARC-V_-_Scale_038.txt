 Summary 
 Yuya  and his brothers combat  G.O.D. , by exploiting its weaknesses. Since that strategy failed, in their darkest hour,  Yuto ,  Yugo  and  Yuri  lend  their final strength  to Yuya before vanishing.
 
 Featured Duel: Yuya Sakaki/Yuto/Yugo/Yuri vs. Eve/G.O.D. 
 Duel continues from the previous Scale . 
 Turn 7: Yuya Sakaki 
At the start of each player's  turn , " Genesis Omega Dragon "  gains  1000  ATK  ("Genesis Omega Dragon": 1000 → 2000 ATK). Yuya  sets  a card, then  Pendulum Summons  " Starving Venemy Dragon ", " Clearwing Fast Dragon ", " Dark Anthelion Dragon " and " Odd-Eyes Phantom Dragon " from his  Extra Deck .
 "Dark Anthelion Dragon" attacks "Genesis Omega Dragon". G.O.D. plays its  effect , placing " Nova Portal " from its  Deck  to  negate the attack  of "Dark Anthelion Dragon" and end Yuya's turn.
 Turn 8: G.O.D. 
"Genesis Omega Dragon" activates its effect and gains 1000 ATK ("Genesis Omega Dragon": 2000 → 3000 ATK). "Clearwing Fast Dragon" activates its effect,  targeting  "Genesis Omega Dragon", to negate its effects and have its ATK become zero. G.O.D. activates the  Pendulum Effect  of "Nova Portal",  destroying  both monsters in G.O.D.'s Pendulum Zones to negate the effect of "Clearwing Fast Dragon" and end the turn.
 Turn 9: Yuya Sakaki 
"Genesis Omega Dragon" activates its effect and gains 1000 ATK ("Genesis Omega Dragon": 3000 → 4000 ATK). Yuya  tributes  all of his monsters to  Special Summon  " G.O.D.-Eyes Phantom Dragon ".
