Yami Yugi & Seto Kaiba Niue silver coins  were minted by Niue in the year of 2016 as part of their several licensed themes they've made so far. They are official  Yu-Gi-Oh!  items, licensed from Konami by the Niue mint.
 
 Features 
 With colored faces of  Yami Yugi  and  Seto Kaiba , both holding a card in their respective dueling style and the  Yu-Gi-Oh!  logo. 
 Each with a weight of 1 Oz. Silver. 
 Both with an Obverse (front) with Queen Elizabeth II, as Niue is a Commonwealth member, so their ruler is the Queen of England. 
 Each comes in a protective capsule, and inside a book-shaped box for easier storage. 
 With a face value each of 2 Dollars (face value is given to commemorative coins to still make them legal tender, but the silver and collectible value is way over the face value).
