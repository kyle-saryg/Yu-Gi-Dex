 In  episode 112 ,  the Big Five  use this card during their duel against  Yami Yugi  and  Joey Wheeler . This card was activated by  Johnson  after he decreased Joey's Life Points to 300. This card's effect allowed it to be protected from  Nezbitt 's " Heavy Storm " when he activated it. In  the next episode ,  Leichter  sends this card to the Graveyard in order to add " Dragon Revival Ritual " from his Deck to his hand.
 This card also appears in a flashback Yami Yugi has when he explains how his " Des Volstgalph " gained 200 ATK despite that he had no Spell or Trap Cards on his side of the field.
