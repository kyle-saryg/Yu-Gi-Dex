A  ruling  is a statement issued by  Konami  which clarifies the interactions between cards and card effects.
 Unofficial rulings  are not issued by Konami, but are based on official rulings (e.g. by extrapolating an official ruling on a specific card's effect to include all cards with a similar effect). While it is generally safe to follow such rulings, and they even often influence judges' decisions, Konami does not recognize them and  occasionally issues official rulings that contradict them .
 In the past, there have been wide discrepancies between rulings in the  TCG  and  OCG ; however, with the acquisition of card operations by Konami, steps have been taken to harmonize the two.
