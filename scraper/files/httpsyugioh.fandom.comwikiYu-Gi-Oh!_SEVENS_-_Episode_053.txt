 " Let's Do This! Rush Swirling! " is the fifty-third episode of the  Yu-Gi-Oh! SEVENS  anime. It first aired in Japan on June 20, 2021.
 Rush Duels  are now booming thanks to the Team Battle Royale tournament. Taking advantage of this,  Luke  tries to force people to join his Rush Duel club. Luke later catches a boy who was watching his Duel from a bush...
 
 Featured Duel: Swirly VS. Otes 
 The duel is conducted as a  Rush Duel .
 Turn 1: Swirly 
 Swirly draws. He Normal Summons " Dark Sorcerer " (4/1500/0), " Magical Beast Wolfram " (3/1100/100) and " Spell Archer " (3/1000/400). He Sets 2 cards. He then tries to attack but cannot since he is going first.
 Turn 2:  Otes 
 Otes draws. He Normal Summons " Lizard Soldier " (3/1100/800) and " Lesser Dragon " (4/1200/1000). He Tributes both of his monsters to  Tribute Summon  " Blue-Eyes White Dragon " (8/3000/2500). He then activates the Spell " Traditional Burst Breath " to destroy all Level 6 or lower monsters on his opponent's field as he controls a Level 7 or higher Normal monster. "Dark Sorcerer", "Magical Beast Wolfram" and "Spell Archer" are all destroyed. "Blue-Eyes" attacks Swirly directly (Swirly: 4000 → 1000 LP).
 Turn 3: Swirly 
 Swirly draws a card, not knowing that the rules of Rush Duels allows the Duelist to draw until they have 5 cards in their hand. After  Luke  informs him of that rule, he draws 4 more cards. He Normal Summons " Stray Familiar " (1/0/1400) and " Mystic Dealer " (3/1000/0). He activates the effect of "Mystic Dealer" to send 1  Spellcaster  monster from his hand to the GY to draw 1 card. He sends " Answerer the Demonic Swordsman " and draws " Sevens Road Wiz ". He Normal Summons "Sevens Road Wiz" (1/1000/0). He activates his Set Spell " Wind Spirit's Blessing " to send 1 card in his hand to the GY to have 1 Spellcaster monster he controls gain 1000 ATK until the End Phase. He sends " Hydro Magician " and increases the ATK of "Sevens Road Wiz" ("Sevens Road Wiz" ATK: 1000 → 2000). He then activates his Set Spell " High Magic - Double Accel " to shuffle 2 Level 5 or higher Spellcaster monsters from the GY into his deck to have 1 Spellcaster monster he controls gain ATK equal to its original ATK until the End Phase. He returns "Hydro Magician" and "Answerer" to increase the ATK of "Sevens Road Wiz" ("Sevens Road Wiz" ATK: 2000 → 3000). He then activates the effect of "Sevens Road Wiz" to send 1 card in his hand to the GY to decrease the ATK of 1 monster on the field that has the same ATK as itself to 0 until the End Phase. He sends " Curtain of Sparks " and decreases the ATK of "Blue-Eyes" to 0 ("Blue-Eyes" ATK: 3000 → 0). "Stray Familiar" attacks "Blue-Eyes" but neither are destroyed in battle since they both have 0 ATK. "Sevens Road Wiz" attacks and destroys "Blue-Eyes" (Otes: 4000 → 1000 LP). "Mystic Dealer" attacks Otes directly (Otes: 1000 → 0 LP).
