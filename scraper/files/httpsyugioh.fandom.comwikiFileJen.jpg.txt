 Biography 
 Pre-World Duel Carnival 
 After  Flip  defeated the  Candy shopkeeper , he walked past Jen and Tori who were eating candy. Flip somehow turned the candy around in their hands whilst walking past, shocking Jen in the process. [1] 
 Jen and Summer later attended swim class where they talked with Tori about how Yuma will "kattobingu" again in swimming (in the dub, they tell Tori if Yuma will jump off the high dive again). They then witnessed Yuma and Caswell getting into an argument as Caswell recognized that the  Emperor's Key  is dangerous to wear when swimming. 
 
 World Duel Carnival 
       Summer and Jen.     
 During  Yuma Tsukumo 's Duel with  Striker , a hologram of Jen and Summer appeared beside Tori via the effect of the " Stadium of Dreams "  Field Spell Card . They later disappeared after Yuma defeated Striker. [2] 
 On the third morning of the  World Duel Carnival , Jen was watching  Nelson Andrews ' Duel with  Nistro . When ever Nelson was in trouble, she screamed, but was overjoyed when he came out on top. However, she was ultimately shocked when Nelson lost. When he left the area, she followed with joy in her eyes alongside the rest of his fan girls. [3] 
 She, along with  Summer , is also a boy crazy fan of  Shark . When having to decide if she favors Shark or  Quattro  more, she sides with the latter. She also cheered for Yuma when he showed his and  Astral 's  ZEXAL  during the Duel against  Vetrix . [4] 
 
 Barian Invasion 
 When she, Summer and  Tori  saw  Caswell  and the Disciplinary School squad, they began to scream when he threw cards at them and told them that their skirts are against the school's dress code. They threw their shoes at him, while saying that the skirts are part of the school's uniform. (in the dub, Caswell told them that gossiping was not allowed; Jen and her friends still threw their shoes at him, regardless) [5]  During the  Heartland Academy  Fun Fair, Jen dressed up as " Lyna the Light Charmer ". When  Anna  wanted to enter the  Couples Duel tournament , Jen along with Summer informed her that only students at the school could participate. [6] 
 
 Barian Emperor Onslaught 
       Summer and Jen in Heartland Tower     
 Jen was among the survivors of Heartland who did not pick up a " Fake Number " and get sacrificed to Barian World. [7]
