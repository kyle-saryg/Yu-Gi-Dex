 The  King of the Netherworld  was the consequential ruler of what was known as the Netherworld in the  Yu-Gi-Oh! 5D's  anime.
 
 Overview 
 At first, he was only mentioned briefly by the  Dark Signers ' leader,  Roman Goodwin  in his rematch against  Yusei Fudo . Roman described him as the "Ultimate God", the one that was said to be the mightiest of them all, and said that the Earthbound Immortals served him.
 According to  Roman , if the four control towers for the original  Ener-D  Reactor were not  activated  before sunset, then the door to the Netherworld would be opened.
 After  Akiza  failed to seal the Lizard Tower before sundown, the Condor geoglyph then appeared in the sky toward the direction where  New Domino City  was. After this, as the original  Ener-D  Reactor's light emanated from inside the  B.A.D  area crater and opened a portal, and the King of the Netherworld emerged from it. 
 At first, it took the form of a giant mass of dark slime, but then began to mutate and acquired another distinctive shape. While the King of the Netherworld started on its path toward the formed  Nazca Line ,  Kuribon  warned  Luna  that they must not let it reach the Condor geoglyph.  
 The  Crimson Dragon  also appeared and transported the  Signers , along with their companions, to the  Stairway to the Dragon Star , where  Rex Goodwin  himself was waiting. As he revealed his true identity as the final Dark Signer, with the Condor mark glowing upon his back, he explained that he must complete the ritual for the King of the Netherworld to gain its full power. Goodwin then proceeded to declare a  Shadow Turbo Duel , which would be held within the Condor geoglyph, as the ritual to welcome the Ruler of the Netherworld, one which ultimately required  Signers  to be sacrificed.
 After Rex Goodwin,  Summoned  " Earthbound Immortal Wiraqocha Rasca ", the King spotted it and dispatched an army of smaller condors to  attack   Yusei ,  Jack , and [[Crow Hogan|Crow].. However, they were fought off by  Ancient Fairy Dragon  and  Black Rose Dragon , which could be summoned by  Luna  and  Akiza , thanks to the geoglyph. In  Signs of Doom, Part 3 , the King of the Netherworld managed to take out  Jack  on Goodwin's order, after his life points had been reduced to 1 by Wiraqocha Rasca.
 After Yusei finally defeated Goodwin, the Crimson Dragon arrived, and used Yusei's " Majestic Star Dragon " to gain a physical form in order to attack the King. The Netherworld´s ruler attacked them with a massive beam, but Yusei and the Crimson Dragon pierced through and entered the King`s body. The moment that Yusei was inside of it, he saw the defeated Dark Signers, along with Goodwin, who had returned to his old self, as well as his brother  Roman . 
 
         
 As both brothers thanked Yusei, they informed him that the other Dark Signers would be revived. However, both brothers decided to remain dead. After they crossed over into the light, Yusei and the Crimson Dragon passed right through the King, which disappeared soon after as a golden ray of light emerged from its body, and vanquishing it.
 
 Trivia 
 Upon reshaping itself into a detailed form, it strongly resembled " Life Stream Dragon ". 
 The properties of the king's dark slime reminisces that of  Anubis , from when a similar black substance dripped from his hand to summoned  Andro Sphinx  and  Sphinx Teleia , as well as when he reformed himself into his giant armored jackal-like monster form. Both are also lords that represent death, hinting at a possible connection between the two.
