 Trivia 
 " After the Struggle " and " Final Destiny " (whose Japanese card names translate to "Genocide War" and "Last War", respectively) are most likely references to the " Ally of Justice " monsters this Deck is built around. In the  Master Guide 3  card storylines , the backstory of the "Ally of Justice" monsters reveals that they were constructed as weapons in the war against the " Worm " monsters, which were eventually eradicated.
