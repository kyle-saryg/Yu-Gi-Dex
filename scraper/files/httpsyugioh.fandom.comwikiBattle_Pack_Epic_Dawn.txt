 Features 
 Each of the cards included in the set was specifically selected to enhance the experience of sealed pack play. To ensure that all Decks have an even selection of various effects and monsters with high/low ATK, the set is split into four distinct groups: [1] 
 
 Cards numbered 1 to 55 are  Rare  cards that encompass the most powerful cards in the set as well as all  Xyz Monsters . 
 Cards numbered 56 to 110 are  Common  cards, mostly  Spell / Trap  cards, and mostly with the ability to remove cards from the field either directly or indirectly (such as by changing the outcome of a battle). 
 Cards numbered 111 to 170 are  Common  cards and are always high- ATK   monsters . 
 Cards numbered 171 to 220 are  Common  cards and are always lower- ATK  monsters with useful effects. 
 " Gem-Knight Pearl " and " Backup Warrior " were made  TCG -legal with the advent of this set, having been  OCG exclusive  cards before.
 All Rare cards in the set have a glossy white or glossy black card title, similar to  Duelist League  Rare cards, rather than the usual silver holofoil.
 This set also introduces a new rarity,  Starfoil Rare .

 Trivia 
 " Dark Mimic LV3 " was originally planned to be included in the set, but was ultimately replaced with " Gravitic Orb ". [2] 
 " Chaos Command Magician " was also considered to be included, but was removed to reduce the number of high-Level monsters in the set. [3]
