 Events 
 Day before 
 Kaiba Land contained the hidden attraction,  Death-T , which was  Kaiba 's tool to exact revenge on  Yugi  for an  earlier defeat . [2] 
 Kaiba invited Yugi and his friend  Jonouchi  to  his mansion  the night before, saying that they would be his special guests at the grand opening. Jonouchi and Yugi still felt that the two of them had been brought there against their will and were forced to stay. Kaiba's brother  Mokuba  even tried to kill them in his  Russian Roulette Dinner  game. [2] 
 Secretly, Kaiba also kidnapped Yugi's grandfather,  Sugoroku . [1] 
 
 Opening 
 Yugi and Jonouchi were surprised by how much the children at the ceremony praised Kaiba. After learning that certain children had been invited free of charge, they considered that they may have misjudged Kaiba and he really wasn't so bad. However after the  interruption , Yugi thought that there were two faces to Kaiba and wondered which one was the real one. [1] 
 Yugi, Jonouchi and the other children played video games and went on 3D simulator rides, where they saw lifelike monsters that looked real. [1] 
 
 Interruption 
 After the guests were let inside Kaiba Land, the former  right hand man  of Kaiba's adoptive father,  Gozaburo, interrupted  the celebration. He accused Kaiba of taking control of KaibaCorp by killing the former CEO, by driving him to suicide. He then called Kaiba the devil incarnate. [1] 
 Kaiba had his men take the intruder away. Kaiba then explained to Yugi and Jonouchi that there are rumors concerning his father's death, but he claimed to have had nothing to do with it and believed his father died in peace knowing Kaiba would take over for him. [1] 
 
 Sugoroku and Kaiba's Duel 
 Main article:  Sugoroku Mutou and Seto Kaiba's Duel (manga) 
 Kaiba faced Sugoroku in a a game of  Duel Monsters  in front of a large audience. Kaiba simulated the  Shadow Game  effects of his  last Duel with Yugi  by using  Solid Vision  to make the monsters played seem lifelike. The Solid Vision monsters were too much for Sugoroku's nerves and Kaiba overpowered Sugoroku's one " Blue-Eyes White Dragon " with his own three copies. [1] 
 When Sugoroku lost, Kaiba simulated the "Experience of Death"  Penalty Game  by having Solid Vision monsters terrorize Sugoroku. Kaiba explained that it takes ten minutes for the simulation to drive an average person insane and would only stop it this time if Yugi agreed to face the park's hidden attraction, Death-T. [1] 
 Yugi agreed to face Death-T and his grandpa was released, although he needed to be taken to the hospital.  Honda  and Jonouchi, who were present decided to accompany Yugi and also brought Honda's baby nephew  Johji . [3] 
 
 Death-T 
 Main article:  Death-T 
 Yugi and his friends faced a series of stages, designed to kill Yugi. They were accompanied by  Anzu  in the first stage, who was working at Kaiba Land, having been employed by someone who didn't know she was Yugi's friend.
 In the  final stage ,  Dark Yugi  defeated Kaiba in a game of  Duel Monsters  and inflicted the "Mind Crush" Penalty Game on him.
