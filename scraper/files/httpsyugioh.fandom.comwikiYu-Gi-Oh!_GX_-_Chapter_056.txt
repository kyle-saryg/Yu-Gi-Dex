 Summary 
   This summary is currently incomplete. 
 Jaden  uses " Damaged Mask " to  Special Summon  " Masked Hero Dusk Crow ". As  Chancellor Sheppard  watches the  Duel  through the screen in his office, he muses that the " Legendary Planets " disappeared after the death of their designer,  Mr. Phoenix . Despite this, " Uranus ", " Saturn " and " Venus " have been shown up in the hands of the American students, so he assumes the rest must be with them as well. He concludes that he should ask  Principal MacKenzie  about it.
 
         Jaden  with " Masked Hero Acid " and " Masked Hero Dark Law ".     
 Adrian tells Jaden that he won't beat "Uranus" with his weakling monsters. Jaden brings out " Masked Hero Dark Law " and uses " Double Attack (Team Strike) ", with allows his " Masked Heroes " to  attack   as one . This defeats "Uranus". As Adrian's  Life Points  drop to zero, he remembers his  his brother . He needs to graduate from the academy to become a professional Duelist, which would pay for his brother's operations. Principal MacKenzie had promised to immediately recommend any American students that defeat the Japanese students for a pro league contract. Jaden is surprised that nothing happened to Adrian after the attack, so he determines that it wasn't a  Shadow Duel , despite the dark aura generated by "Uranus". Seeing Adrian's somber expression he realizes that he had no intent on taking " Winged Kuriboh ".
 Adrian walks away, and is suddenly confronted by Principal MacKenzie in the forest. MacKenzie tells him that he's entertained him long another, and that he'll take back the card. Adrian finally recalls that MacKenzie had given him the card in the first place. Adrian is engulfed in darkness and falls unconscious. At the beach,  Syrus  waits for his opponent.  Jesse  arrives, sliding in while chasing a dragonfly, which he identifies as an  oniyanma . Jesse is surprised that his opponent is " Kaiser 's little brother", but he then apologizes for calling Syrus that. Syrus responds that it's alright - he's proud of his brother and aspires to beat him. They begin their Duel.
