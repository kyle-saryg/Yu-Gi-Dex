 Featured Duels 
 Sylvio Sawatari and Crow Hogan vs. Emma and Jacob vs. Battle Beast 
 Duel continues from the previous episode . 
 The  Battle Beast  Duels and defeats  Emma  and  Jacob . 
 An unknown amount of time is skipped.  Crow   controls  " Assault Blackwing - Raikiri the Rain Shower " (2600/2000), has no cards in his  hand  and has 300  LP .  Sylvio  controls no cards, has no cards in his hand and has 2700 LP. The Battle Beast controls " Gladiator Beast Gyzarus " in Attack Position [Notes 1] , has an unknown amount of cards in his hand and an unknown amount of LP.
 Crow's turn 
"Raikiri"  attacks  Sylvio  directly  (Sylvio: 2700 → 100 LP). The attack damages Sylvio's  Duel Disk , which causes a compulsory withdrawal for Sylvio from the Duel. Crow  Sets  a card.
 Battle Beast's turn 
An unspecified attack or  effect   destroys  "Raikiri" and Crow takes some form of damage. Crow  activates  his  face-down  " Blackwing - Last Will ", whose  effect  causes the Battle Beast's LP to drop to 100 (Crow: 300 → 0 LP; Battle Beast: ??? → 100 LP).
 
 Yuya Sakaki and Gong Strong vs. Battle Beast 
       Yuya  and  Gong  vs.  BB .     
 At the start of the Duel, the  Field Spell Card , " Crossover " is  activated , as per the rules of an  Action Duel . It will allow the players to use  Action Cards , but they may only have 1 in their  hand  at a time. The Field Spell Card " Predaprimal Jungle " is also activated.
 Turn 1: Battle Beast 
The  Battle Beast   Normal Summons  " Gladiator Beast Laquari " (1800/400) and  Sets  three cards.
 Turn 2: Yuya 
 Yuya  activates " Performapal Shieldrummer " (   6) and " Performapal Odd-Eyes Unicorn " (   8) in his  Pendulum Zones . Yuya  Pendulum Summons  " Odd-Eyes Pendulum Dragon " (2500/2000) from his hand in  Attack Position . "Odd Eyes"  attacks  "Laquari", but the Battle Beast activates his  face-down   Continuous Trap Card  " Gladiator Beast's Medallion ", which prevents the  destruction  of " Gladiator Beast " monsters  by battle , but doubles the  battle damage  the Battle Beast receives (BB 4000 → 2600). As "Laquari"  battled , the Battle Beast activates its effect,  returning  it to the  Deck  to  Special Summon  a "Gladiator Beast" monster with a different name from his Deck. He Special Summons " Gladiator Beast Secutor " (400/300) in  Defense Position . 
 Turn 3: Gong 
 Gong  activates " Superheavy Samurai General Jade " (   1) and " Superheavy Samurai General Coral " (   8) in his Pendulum Zones. Gong Pendulum Summons " Superheavy Samurai Prepped Defense ", " Superheavy Samurai Soulfire Suit " and " Superheavy Samurai Battleball " from his hand, all in Attack Position. He then  tunes  the  Level  3 "Prepped Defense" and the Level 2 "Soulfire Suit" with the Level 2  Tuner monster  "Battleball" to  Synchro Summon  " Superheavy Samurai Stealth Ninja " (1200/2800) in Defense Position. Gong activates the effect of "Stealth Ninja", which allows him to halve its  DEF  to let it attack  directly  this  Battle Phase  ("Stealth Ninja" 2800 → 1400), while its other effect allows to attack while in Defense Position and apply its DEF for  damage calculation . "Stealth Ninja" attacks the Battle Beast directly, but the Battle Beast activates his face-down Continuous Trap Card " Gladiator Beast's Valor " which prevents monsters from attacking anything, except "Gladiator Beast" monsters. The attack is redirected to "Secutor", which is not destroyed due to "Medallion of Gladiator Beast". As "Secutor" battled, the Battle Beast activates its effect, which allows him to Special Summon two "Gladiator Beast" monsters from his Deck, except "Secutor". He Special Summons " Gladiator Beast Augustus " (2600/1000) and " Gladiator Beast Murmillo " (800/400). As "Augustus" was Special Summoned by the effect of a "Gladiator Beast" monster, its effect activates, letting the Battle Beast Special Summon a "Gladiator Beast" monster from his hand in Defense Position, but it will be returned to the Deck at the  End Phase . The Battle Beast Special Summons another copy of "Murmillo" (800/400). As both copies of "Murmillo" were Special Summoned by the effects of "Gladiator Beast" monsters, their effects activate, allowing the Battle Beast to destroy a  face-up  monster on the field. He destroys "Odd Eyes" and "Stealth Ninja". As he  controls  a "Gladiator Beast" monster, the Battle Beast activates his face-down " Thumbs Down ", which inflicts 500  damage  for each destroyed card to its controller (Yuya: 4000 → 3500, Gong: 4000 → 3500). As "Stealth Ninja" was destroyed by a card effect this turn and is in the Graveyard, its effect activates during the  End Phase , letting Gong Special Summon it (1200/2800) in Defense Position. The "Murmillo" Special Summoned by the effect of "Augustus" is returned to the Battle Beast's Deck during the End Phase, also via the effect of "Augustus".  
 Turn 4: Battle Beast 
The Battle Beast returns "Murmillo", "Augustus", and "Secutor" to his Deck to Special Summon " Gladiator Beast Andabata " (1000/2800) from his  Extra Deck  in Attack Position. He activates the effect of "Andabatae", which allows him to Special Summon a "Gladiator Beast" monster from his Extra Deck,  ignoring its Summoning conditions , but it will be returned to the Extra Deck if it  battles . He Special Summons " Gladiator Beast Gyzarus " (2400/1500) in Attack Position. As "Gyzarus" was Special Summoned, its effect activates, letting the Battle Beast destroy up to two cards on the field. The Battle Beast destroys "Stealth Ninja" and "Shieldrummer" (Yuya: 3500 → 3000, Gong: 3500 → 3000). "Gyzarus" attacks Yuya directly (Yuya 3000 → 600). As it battled, "Gyzarus" is returned to the Extra Deck. As a "Gladiator Beast" returned to the Deck, the Battle Beast activates the effect of "Andabatae", increasing its ATK by the value of the returned monster's ("Andabatae" 1000 → 3400). "Andabatae" attacks Yuya directly, but Gong finds and activates the  Action Card  " Benkei Guard ", which Special Summons a Level 1 " Benkei Token " (1000/???) and redirects attacks only to the token. The token cannot be destroyed by battle or  monster effects . "Andabatae" attacks the "Benkei Token", (Gong 3000 → 600). As "Andabatae" battled, the Battle Beast activates its effect, returning it to the Extra Deck to Special Summon two "Gladiator Beast" monsters from his Deck. The Battle Beast Special Summons " Gladiator Beast Bestiari " (1500/800) and "Gladiator Beast Murmillo" (800/400), both in Attack Position. As it was Special Summoned by the effect of a "Gladiator Beast" monster, the effect of "Murmillo" activates and the Battle Beast targets the "Benkei Token" for destruction, but it cannot be destroyed by monster effects. As "Bestiari" was Special Summoned by the effect of a "Gladiator Beast" monster the Battle Beast activates its effect, which lets him destroy a  Spell / Trap Card  on the field. He destroys "Odd-Eyes Unicorn" (Yuya: 600 → 100). The Battle Beast returns "Bestiari" and "Murmillo" to his Deck to Special Summon "Gladiator Beast Gyzarus" (2400/1500) in Attack Position. He activates the effect of "Gyzarus" to destroy "General Coral" and "General Jade" (Gong: 600 → 0). 
 Duel continues in the next episode .

 Errors 
 In this episode, the Battle Beast uses the term " Fusion Summon " when he  Special Summons  his  Contact Fusion Monsters . This is incorrect, as Contact Fusion is not a form of Fusion Summoning, which is also explicitely written on the card text of his monsters. Additionally, the summon animations of his Contact Fusion Monsters is the same as the Fusion Summoning's, which contradicts with the Contact Fusion featured in  episode 106 . Furthermore, this error becomes more apparent in the  following episode , as Sanders Fusions Summons a Contact Fusion Monster with the help of " Test Fusion ", which specifically allows him to do that.
 
 Notes 
 
 ↑   Though not shown as a  monster , the card can be seen on his  Duel Disk  as he  draws  to start his  turn .
