      Obelisk Blue - Boys' Dorm     
 Obelisk Blue  (オベリスク・ブルー  Oberisuku Burū ) is the highest of the three dormitories at  Duel Academy . The reason for its superiority over the other two dorms goes back to the fact  Seto Kaiba  is the owner of this school, and that he owned " Obelisk the Tormentor " during  Battle City . 
 The dorm mostly houses students who have wealth and connections. Luxurious interior design, high-quality rooming, and finer food are offered to the students who reside here. In order to start in Obelisk Blue, upon enrollment, not only does one needs to have high grades in the written examination, but they also need to have earned a diploma from another Duelist prep school.
 
       Obelisk Blue - Girls' Dorm     
 The dormitories are divided into separate sections based on gender.  Dr. Crowler  is in charge of the male dorms, while  Fonda Fontaine  is in charge of the female dorms. Contrary to popular belief, all female students that are accepted into Duel Academy are automatically placed in the Obelisk Blue dorms regardless of whether they have the skill necessary to have been accepted into dorm (primarily exampled by  Jasmine and Mindy ). The reason for this is because the lower two dorms do not have the appropriate housing, as Obelisk Blue is the only one with separate dormitories for both female and male students.
 There is a running gag throughout the series where the characters of Obelisk Blue keep disappearing or transferring out of the dorm, despite the fact that it's valued as the place all the students want to be. This is seen with the creation of the Obelisk White, and the constant dorm rearrangement of  Chazz Princeton .
 
 Uniforms

         The Obelisk Blue female Uniform     
         The  Senior  Obelisk Blue male Uniform     
 The Obelisk Blue students are identified usually by blue long-tailed jackets with white trimmings, unlike the  Ra Yellow  and  Slifer Red  students, whose uniform jackets are shorter in length. However, there are variations on this jacket, as seen by  Vellian Crowler ,  Atticus Rhodes ,  Zane  and  Syrus  Truesdale's outfits. The most common variant are white jackets with blue trimmings (basically an inverted version of the standard male uniform). This version is supposed to be worn by second-years or higher (seeing as Chazz Princeton didn't wear one, and, after all, he was a top-ranked student) Obelisk Blue students, like Atticus Rhodes or Zane Truesdale. In addition, in the beginning of GX, another variant was seen for Obelisk blue males. In episode 4, there were also Obelisk Males with short jackets that looked similar to blue Slifer Jackets, and long Jackets.
 For females, the typical Obelisk Blue attire consists of a white top with blue trimming, a blue miniskirt, and royal blue boots. However, a few students wear different outfits with their Obelisk vests (e.g.  Missy ).

 Trivia 
 Obelisk's dormitory design is highly inspired by French famous châteaux. The girl's dorm is based on the  Château de Chenonceau  while the boy's dorm is similar to  Château de Chambord . 
 In the anime, all the Academy girls belonged to the Obelisk Blue Dormitory.
