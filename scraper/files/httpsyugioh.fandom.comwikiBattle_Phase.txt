       Order of a  turn .     
 The  Battle Phase  (Japanese: バトルフェイズ  Batoru Feizu ) is the  Phase  in which  battles  are conducted. A Battle Phase can be conducted every  turn  (except the first turn of the  Duel ) after the  turn player  ends their  Main Phase 1 . [1] 
 " An Unfortunate Report ", " Weather Report ", and " Last Turn " are the only cards that can grant multiple Battle Phases in one turn. Some cards like  Electromagnetic Turtle  and  Negate Attack  can end the Battle Phase.
 
 Breakdown 
 The Battle Phase is split into four steps:
 
 Start Step 
 Battle Step 
 Damage Step  (including  damage calculation ) 
 End Step 
 The Start Step, Battle Step, and End Step always occur during every Battle Phase, unless skipped due to a  card effect . The Damage Step only occurs if a monster's attack is successful, up to the point where both players agree to leave the Battle Step. If a card effect ends the Battle Phase (such as " Battle Fader "), it immediately becomes the  End Step [2] , unless the card effect changes the  phase  directly (such as " Neko Mane King "), in which case it is no longer the Battle Phase.
 
 Entering the Battle Phase 
 A player does not need to control any monsters in order to enter their Battle Phase. [3]  Even if their opponent controls no valid attack targets (e.g. the opponent only controls 2 face-up copies of " Marauding Captain " and/or a face-up " Earthbound Immortal " monster), a player may still enter their Battle Phase. [4] 
 A player entering their Battle Phase is optional after their Main Phase 1 ends, except when  card effects  mandate it. For example, the turn player must enter their Battle Phase if a card effect is forcing a monster(s) they control to attack during that turn, [5]  even if another card effect is currently preventing them from attacking, such as a face-up " Gravity Bind ". [6]  If the turn player does not choose to enter their Battle Phase after their Main Phase 1 ends, they must proceed immediately to the  End Phase , without entering their  Main Phase 2 . [7] 
 If a card effect skips a player's Main Phase 1, such as that of " Timeater ", that player does not have to enter their Battle Phase from their  Standby Phase  — they may choose to enter their End Phase instead. [8]  However, if card effects skip the same player's Main Phase 1 and Battle Phase during the same turn, that player cannot enter their Main Phase 2 and must instead proceed immediately to their End Phase. [9]
