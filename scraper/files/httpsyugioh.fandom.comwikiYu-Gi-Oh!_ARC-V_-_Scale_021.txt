 Summary 
   This summary is currently incomplete. 
 As  Yuya  finds himself in his mindscape looking over a cliff to a network of roots holding large glowing orbs, recognizing them as his memories,  Ren  takes his  Turbo Duel  against  Yugo  to another level by using his " White Moray " and " White Aura Whale " to  Synchro Summon  " White Aura Biphamet " to the field. It was at this time that Yugo's vision begins to blur, both  Yuto  and  Yuri  realizing their connection to Yuya is being disrupted. "Biphamet" destroys Yugo's " Clearwing Fast Dragon " despite its  ATK  reduced to zero.
 Yugo attempts to activate his " Sonic Cyclone " Trap, but is forced to switch with Yuya as he and their counterparts start to disappear. After managing to regain control of the Duel Runner, Yuya understands Yugo's intentions and uses Sonic Cyclone's effect to destroy " Speedroid Hexasaucer " in his  Pendulum Zone  to  Special Summon  it in  Attack Position . This allows Yuya to half the inflicted battle damage between himself and Ren. After Yuya Normal Summons " Enter-Mate Rolling Sambaa " and  Sets  a card, he uses his monster's ability to evade battle damage. 
 Yuya sees that he must figure out "Biphamet" if he is to stand a chance against Ren...
 
 Featured Duel: Yugo/Yuya Sakaki vs. Ren 
 Duel continues from the previous Scale . 
 Turn 3: Ren 
 Ren  obtains an  Action Card . He  activates  the  effect  of " White Salvation ",  adding  " White Moray " from his  Graveyard  to his  hand , which he subsequently  Normal Summons  (600/200). Ren tunes "White Moray" to his now  tuner  " White Aura Whale " to  Synchro Summon  " White Aura Biphamet " (3300/3000).  Yugo  activates the effect of " Clearwing Fast Dragon " to reduce the  ATK  of "Biphamet" to 0 ("Biphamet": 3300 → 0 ATK); regardless, "Biphamet"  attacks  and  destroys  "Clearwing" (Yugo: 4000 → 3200 LP). [Notes 1]  Ren then activates the Action Card " Double Banking ",  sending  " Full Fairing " from his hand to the Graveyard to allow "Biphamet" to attack a second time. "Biphamet" attacks Yugo  directly , but Yugo activates his  face-down  " Sonic Cyclone ", allowing him to destroy  Spell / Trap Cards  up to the number of  monsters  that were destroyed this  turn .
 At this point, Yugo switches places with  Yuya .
 Yuya uses the effect of "Sonic Cyclone" to destroy " Speedroid Hexasaucer " in his  Pendulum Zone . This activates the effect of "Hexasaucer", allowing Yuya to  Special Summon  it in  Attack Position  (100/1600). "Biphamet" attacks and destroys "Hexasaucer", but the  Monster effect  of "Hexasaucer" activates, halving the  battle damage  to Yuya and inflicting the same amount of damage to Ren (Yuya: 3200 → 1600 LP; Ren: 2750 → 1150 LP). During the  End Phase , the effect of "Clearwing" wears off and "Biphamet" regains its ATK and effect.
 Turn 4: Yuya Sakaki 
Ren obtains an Action Card. Yuya Normal Summons " Enter-Mate Rolling Sambaa " (300/800) and  Sets  1 card.
 Turn 5: Ren 
Ren activates the Action Card " Reverse Lock ", preventing Yuya from activating his Set cards this turn. He attacks "Rolling Sambaa" with "Biphamet", but Yuya activates the former's effect, switching its  battle position  to  negate  the attack. Despite that, "Biphamet" attacks "Rolling Sambaa". [Notes 1]  Yuya activates the effect of " Speedroid Marble Machine " in his Pendulum Zone, switching "Rolling Samber" back to  Attack Position  and preventing its destruction by battle or card effects this turn. The attack continues, but Yuya activates the other effect of "Rolling Sambaa",  banishing  "Sonic Cyclone" from his Graveyard to reduce the  battle damage  to zero. Ren activates the effect of "White Salvation", adding "White Moray" from his Graveyard to his hand, and Sets 1 card.
 Duel continues in the next Scale .
