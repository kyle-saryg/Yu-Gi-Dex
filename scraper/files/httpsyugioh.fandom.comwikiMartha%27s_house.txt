      The  Stardust Dragon statue  outside Martha's house.     
 Martha's house  is a location in  Satellite  where  Martha  and a number of orphans and other people with less-than-ideal lives live.
 After  Yusei Fudo  was injured during his Duel with  Kalin Kessler , he was taken to Martha's house to recover. Throughout his recovery, Yusei stayed here to fix his  Duel Runner . He also spoke with  Akiza Izinski 's  father  here, during her stay in the Hospital.
 During the  Signer 's return to  Satellite , after the  Dark Signer 's attacked, Yusei and the others landed near the orphanage to check up on everyone.
 About a year later,  Bashford  became a resident at Martha's and built a  Stardust Dragon statue  outside.
