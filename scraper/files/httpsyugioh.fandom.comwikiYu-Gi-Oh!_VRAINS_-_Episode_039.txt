 The Gore  confronts  Varis  and challenges him to a  Duel . Meanwhile, the Tower of Hanoi is getting closer to completion, gradually absorbing everything in LINK VRAINS...
 
 Featured Duel: Varis vs. The Gore 
         
 The Duel is conducted as a  Master Duel .
 Turn 1: The Gore 
The Gore Normal Summons " Gouki Suprex " (1800/0). As "Suprex" was Normal Summoned, The Gore activates its effect to Special Summon a " Gouki " monster from his hand. He Special Summons " Gouki Twistcobra " (1600/0). The Gore uses "Suprex" and "Twistcobra" to Link Summon " Gouki Jet Ogre " (2000/LINK-2/←↓) to the Extra Monster Zone. As "Suprex" and "Twistcobra" were sent from the field to the GY, The Gore activates both of their effects to add a "Gouki" card from his Deck to his hand. He adds two unknown cards. The Gore activates the Spell Card " Gouki Re-Match " to Special Summon two "Gouki" monsters with different Levels from his GY in Defense Position. He Special Summons "Suprex" (1800/0) and "Twistcobra" (1600/0). The Gore uses "Suprex" and the Link-2 "Jet Ogre" to Link Summon " Gouki Thunder Ogre " (2200/LINK-3/↙↑↘) to the Extra Monster Zone. The effect of "Thunder Ogre" allows the turn player to Normal Summon an additional time during their Main Phase to a zone "Thunder Ogre" points to. The Gore Normal Summons "Suprex" to the zone the bottom-left Link Arrow of "Thunder Ogre" points to. As "Suprex" was Normal Summoned, The Gore activates its effect, Special Summoning " Gouki Riscorpio " (2300/0) from his hand.
 Turn 2: Varis 
As The Gore controls a Link Monster, Varis Special Summons " Gateway Dragon " (1600/1400) from his hand by its effect. Varis activates the effect of "Gateway Dragon" to Special Summon a Level 4 or lower DARK Dragon monster from his hand. He Special Summons " Sniffer Dragon " (800/400). As "Sniffer Dragon" was Normal or Special Summoned, he activates its effect to add another copy of "Sniffer Dragon" from his Deck to his hand. Varis Normal Summons another "Sniffer Dragon" (800/400). Varis uses "Gateway Dragon" and the two copies of "Sniffer Dragon" to Link Summon " Triple Burst Dragon " (2400/LINK-3/↑←↓) to the Extra Monster Zone. As there are two monsters in the Extra Monster Zones with the same Link Rating, Varis activates the Spell Card " Arrow Charge " to draw two cards and reveal them, but Varis must banish any of those drawn cards during the End Phase if they are still in his hand. He draws "Triggering Wurm" and "Link Protection". Varis uses the effect of "Thunder Ogre" to Normal Summon " Triggering Wurm " (600/600) to the zone the top Link Arrow of "Thunder Ogre" points to. Varis uses "Triggering Wurm" and the Link-3 "Triple Burst Dragon" to Link Summon " Topologic Bomber Dragon " (3000/LINK-4/↑↙↓↘) to the Extra Monster Zone. As "Triggering Wurm" was used as a Link Material for the Link Summon of a Link Monster, Varis activates its effect to Special Summon it to a zone that Link Monster points to. He Special Summons it to a zone "Bomber Dragon" points to. As a monster was Special Summoned to a zone a Link Monster points to, the effect of "Bomber Dragon" activates, destroying all monsters in the Main Monster Zones, but The Gore activates the effect of "Twistcobra", Tributing a "Gouki" monster to increase the ATK of another "Gouki" monster he controls by the Tributed monster's ATK until the end of the turn. He Tributes "Riscorpio" and increases the ATK of "Thunder Ogre" ("Thunder Ogre": 2200 → 4500 ATK). The effect of "Bomber Dragon" resolves, and "Suprex", "Twistcobra" and "Triggering Wurm" are destroyed. As "Triggering Wurm" was destroyed by a Link Monster's effect, Varis activates its effect to draw a card. As monsters "Thunder Ogre" points to were destroyed, The Gore activates its effect, increasing its ATK by 400 ("Thunder Ogre": 4500 → 4900 ATK). As "Suprex", "Twistcobra" and "Riscorpio" were sent from the field to the GY, The Gore activates all their effects, adding three unknown "Gouki" cards from his Deck to his hand. Varis activates the Continuous Spell Card "Link Protection". Once per turn, when "Bomber Dragon" battles, Revolver can prevent it from destroyed by that battle and prevent the battle damage to both players. At the end of the Damage Step in which Varis activated this effect, the monster "Bomber Dragon" battled with is destroyed.
 "Bomber Dragon" attacks "Thunder Ogre", with Varis using the effect of "Link Protection" to prevent "Bomber Dragon" from being destroyed, and take no battle damage from that battle. After damage calculation, the effect of "Link Protection" destroys "Thunder Ogre". As "Bomber Dragon" attacked The Gore's monster, its effect activates, inflicting damage to The Gore equal to that monster's original ATK, but as Varis activated a card or effect that would inflict damage to him, The Gore activates the effect of " Gouki Octostretch " in his hand, discarding it to halve the damage (The Gore: 4000 → 2900 LP). Varis Sets a card.
 Turn 3: The Gore 
The Gore activates the Spell Card "Re-Match", Special Summoning "Suprex" (1800/0) and "Twistcobra" (1600/0) in Defense Position. The Gore uses "Suprex" and "Twistcobra" to Link Summon " Gouki Heel Ogre " (1000/LINK-2/↑↓) to the zone the top Link Arrow of "Bomber Dragon" points to. As a monster was Special Summoned to a zone a Link Monster points to, the effect of "Bomber Dragon" activates, destroying all monsters in the Main Monster Zones, but as a monster "Shadow Ogre" points to activated its effect, The Gore activates its effect to negate the activation of that monster's effect, destroying it, then Special Summoning a "Gouki" Link Monster from his GY. The effect of "Bomber Dragon" is negated, it is destroyed, and The Gore Special Summons "Thunder Ogre" (2200/LINK-3/↙↑↘). As "Suprex" and "Twistcobra" were sent from the field to the GY, The Gore activates both of their effects, adding two unknown "Gouki" cards from his Deck to his hand. As "Bomber Dragon" was destroyed, Varis activates the effect of "Link Protection", banishing both it and "Bomber Dragon" from his GY to prevent The Gore from attacking this turn unless he has at least the same number of Link Monsters as the Link Rating of "Bomber Dragon", in this case four. The Gore Normal Summons "Suprex" (1800/0). As "Suprex" was Normal Summoned, The Gore activates its effect, Special Summoning "Riscorpio" (2300/0) from his hand. The Gore activates the effect of " Gouki Headbatt " which lets him send a "Gouki" monster from his hand to the GY, Special Summon "Headbatt", and increase the ATK of a "Gouki" monster he controls by 800 until the end of the turn. He sends " Gouki Moonsault ", targets "Thunder Ogre" and Special Summons "Headbatt" (800/0) ("Thunder Ogre": 2200 → 3000 ATK). The Gore uses "Suprex", "Riscorpio" and "Headbatt" to Link Summon " Gouki The Great Ogre " (2600/LINK-3/↙↓↘) to the Extra Monster Zone. As "Riscorpio" and "Headbatt" were sent from the field to the GY, The Gore activates both of their effects, adding " Gouki Ringtrainer " and "Gouki Face Turn". The Gore activates the Continuous Spell Card " Gouki Shout ". Whenever a "Gouki" monster attacks, it will gain 300 ATK for every "Gouki" monster The Gore controls during the Damage Step. The Gore activates the Spell Card " Gouki Face Turn " destroying a "Gouki" card he controls to Special Summon a "Gouki" monster from his GY. He destroys "Shout" to Special Summon "Jet Ogre" (2000/LINK-2/←↓) from his GY.
 "Great Ogre" attacks Varis directly. As The Gore's monster declared an attack, Varis activates his face-down Trap Card " Mirror Force " destroying all Attack Position monsters The Gore controls. "Great Ogre", "Thunder Ogre", "Shadow Ogre" and "Jet Ogre" are destroyed.

 Mistakes 
 In the dub, Gore refers to Varis' " Mirror Force " as the card " Ghost Gal  warned us about". Gore never saw Ghost Gal's duel against Varis and was in fact, warned of Varis' threat by  Playmaker . This is reflected in Go Onizuka's speech in the original version after he loses his monsters.
