 Biography 
 Anime 
       Aster  discovers his father's body, surrounded by the " Destiny Heroes ".     
 Mr. Phoenix worked as a card designer for  Industrial Illusions . He eventually began creating the " Destiny Heroes ". Seeing this as an opportunity,  The Light of Destruction  influenced Phoenix into creating a vessel to house it's essence. Though he tried to resist, he was unable to, and eventually created " Destiny Hero - Plasma ". This card was infused with the Light of Destruction, who then began to seek a human host. By chance, Phoenix's son  Aster  let a design concept blow away in the wind, and in chasing after it bumped into  The D , a criminal who was down on his luck. Aster mentioned that the card his father was creating would be one of the most powerful ever made. Knowing the money that he could make Dueling  professionally , The D broke into the Phoenix residence that night to steal the card. The Light of Destruction inside the card influenced him, and he killed Mr. Phoenix in the ensuing struggle. In the English dub, Mr. Phoenix was said to be kidnapped, but his death was still alluded to by The D himself. This made his son an orphan, but The D adopted Aster in order to cover his trail.
 
 Legacy 
 In the next ten years, The D used the destiny-altering powers of the Light of Destruction to reign as the champion of the  Pro League , while Aster grows into a strong Duelist who ranks high in the League himself despite only being fifteen. Aster had vowed to find his father's murderer, and Duels with "Destiny Heroes" his father created. He knew that when he found "Plasma", he would find his father's murder. The D eventually invited Aster to his yacht, and there he revealed the truth and Dueled Aster. In addition to his winning record in the Pro League, The D had competed in numerous underground Duels, where he had used "Plasma" to imprison the souls of countless Duelists. The first victim was Mr. Phoenix himself, who briefly communicated with Aster during the Duel. He urged his son to win the Duel, which would release the souls of the Duelists and purify the card. After some hesitation, Aster did so, thwarting The D's strategy via " Destiny Hero - Dark Angel " and attacking with " Destiny Hero - Celestial " to destroy "Plasma" and win the Duel. With this, the soul of Mr. Phoenix was finally able to rest in peace.
 Mr. Phoenix could be seen during  Franz 's flashback amongst the employees applauding  Chumley Huffington  for creating a new card. For an unexplained reason, he was seen alive despite the fact that he should be dead a long time ago.
 
 Manga 
       Mr. Phoenix in the  manga .     
 Mr. Phoenix was a card designer. Due to this fact,  Tragoedia  chose him as a vessel. Tragoedia continued to raise Phoenix's son  Aster  while possessing him, with Aster none the wiser. While possessing Phoenix, Tragoedia created the " Legendary Planets ", which he imbued with the power to sap small amounts of energy from Duelists who faced them. He also created the cards he would use in his  personal  Deck during this time. [1]  When Phoenix's use was at its end, Tragoedia called for a meeting with  Principal MacKenzie  of the American Duel Academy. During this meeting in MacKenzie's office, Tragoedia released his hold on Phoenix and possessed MacKenzie instead, killing Phoenix in the process and taking the "Legendary Planets" from him. [2]  Through MacKenzie, Tragoedia kept in contact with Aster, with Aster still unaware of his existence. He gave Aster " The Grand Jupiter " from the "Legendary Planet" series, telling him that his father would have wanted him to have it when he was mature enough. [3]
