Single-elimination  or  knockout  is a tournament structure, in which the loser of each game is immediately eliminated from the tournament. This halves the number of remaining competitors each round and continues until only one competitor is remaining and declared the winner.
 In both the real world and fictional elements of  Yu-Gi-Oh! , single-elimination is commonly used in the final stages of tournaments.
