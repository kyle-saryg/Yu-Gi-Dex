 Format 
 This does not totally conform to the rules of the  Official Card Game . Some of the  monsters  and  Magic / Trap Cards  have different  effects .
 During gameplay there is more than one way to win. A player may win by decreasing the opponent's  life points  to zero, forcing your opponent to run out of cards (have them unable to draw a card at the start of their turn), or by having all five pieces of  Exodia  in your hand.
 In order to duel, a player's  Deck  must contain exactly 40 cards and be under their current Duelist Level. If the Deck is over/under 40 cards or over the Deck limit cost, the player will not be able to duel until the error is fixed. 
 Here are some basic rules for playing:
 
 You may have up to five  monsters  in the  field 
 You may have up to five cards in your hand (If you have five cards in hand at the start of your turn, you will not be able to draw a new card) 
 Each monster card may attack any opposition  monster card  on the  field 
 Once the  field  is empty, you may attack the opposing duelist's  Life Points 
 Each duelist starts with 8000 Life Points 
 One Tribute is needed to level 5 and 6 monsters, 2 for 7 and 8, 3 for any level above 8. 
 Unlike the Real  OCG / TCG  it should be noted that many monsters has their level changed, any monster that has 1400 or more  ATK  has changed to a level 5 monster. 
 You may only  summon  one  monsters  per turn. 
 You may also set one  Trap Card  on the  field 
 Battle types 
 In the game, players may notice a few different types of battle between monster cards. 
 The most basic way to defeat an opposing monster is to have a monster with higher attack 
 Example: Player A's card = 1000  ATK , Player B's card = 1200  ATK . Player A's card is destroyed and loses 200  Life Points 
 However, in  Yu-Gi-Oh! Duel Monsters 4: Battle of Great Duelist   monsters  can be destroyed because they have an inferior Alignment (which substitutes Attribute in this game). In this format, the difference between  Attack  or  Defense  points does not matter and the card with the inferior alignment is instantly destroyed. The exception to this rule is when the  monster  with the superior alignment also has higher  attack points  (when attacking) or  defense points  (when being attacked in  Defense position ), in which case  Battle Damage  is calculated normally. However, when a  Defense position   monster  is attacked by a  monster  with an inferior alignment, the monster with the inferior alignment is destroyed.
 
         Attributes Fight     
 Alignment list :
 
         Main Menu     
 Fire   beats   Forest 
 Forest   beats   Wind 
 Wind   beats   Earth 
 Earth   beats   Thunder 
 Thunder   beats   Water 
 Water   beats   Fire 
 also:
 Shadow   beats   Light 
 Light   beats   Fiend 
 Fiend   beats   Dreams 
 Dreams   beats   Shadow 
 
 Fusion 
 Since " Polymerization " is not included in this game, Fusions occur differently; selecting one card and placing it on top of another compatible card could result in a fusion for an entirely different  monster .
 These Fusions are Alignment-based and are reflected as such in the combination they create. For instance, fusing " Thunder Kid " with " Yamatano Dragon Scroll " would result in " Thunder Dragon ". Similarly, combining it with any number of  Aqua  monsters would normally result in " Bolt Escargot ". Also, combining " Time Wizard " with " Baby Dragon " would result in " Thousand Dragon ".
