 Summary 
 Domino Town 
 In  Domino City ,  Dark Yugi  challenges the  Rare Hunter  to a Duel after he refuses  Jonouchi 's challenge. The Rare Hunter tells Yugi that he's very brave to challenge him and accepts. Jonouchi tries to stop Yugi, but he tells Jonouchi to stay back. Dark Yugi learns that this man is in fact on of the  ghouls  who have come to  Domino City  to win all the rare cards on the  Battle City  tournament. Yugi promises to smash every one of them. Jonouchi tries to tell Yugi about the Rare Hunter's  deck , but Yugi tells him to stay quiet and promises to get his  Red-Eyes Black Dragon  back so they can enter the tournament together. When Jonouchi still tries to warn him, Yugi tells him that no matter what kind of dirty tricks the Rare Hunter has hidden up his sleeve, he has no right to know the enemy strategy before the duel as it would be an unfair advantage. He swears to the Rare hUnter hat he will crush him, and the duel begins as a crowd of onlookers form. A list of rules appear to the reader describing the rules of Battle City:
 
 
 
 The tournament uses the special "Duel Monsters Super Expert Rules"  
 - All participants must use  Duel Disks . 
 - Each player starts with 4000  Life Points . 
 - Each player's  deck  must contain a minimum of 40 cards (Any less will result in disqualification).
 - The order of play is determined randomly. When the game begins, each player draws five cards from their deck.
 - A player's  hand  may have a maximum of seven cards at any time.
 - On their turn, each player may play  Monster Cards ,  Spell Cards , or  Trap Cards 
 
 Conditions of Victory 
 - When a player's life points reach zero, that player loses.
 - When a player cannot draw a card on their turn, that player loses.
 
 Monster Card Battle 
 - Monster Cards may be played in either  Attack  or  Defence Mode  (Attack Mode is indicated by the card being face-up and vertical, and Defence Mode is indicated by the card being face-down and horizontal).
 
 Attack vs. Attack 
 - The monster with higher ATK (Attack Points) wins. The losing monster is destroyed and the difference in ATK points is subtracted from the losing player's Life Points.
 
 Attack vs. Defence 
 - If the attacker's ATK is higher than the defender's DEF (Defence Points), the defending monster is destroyed. The defending player's Life Points are unaffected.
 - If the attacker's ATK is lower than the defender's DEF, neither monster is destroyed. The difference in points is subtracted from the attacking player's Life Points.
 
 Super Expert Rules 
 - Monsters may directly attack the enemy player if the player has no monsters to defend with.
 - Monsters with five or more stars may only be  summoned  by  sacrificing  one of the player's other monsters.  
 - Monsters with seven or more stars may only be  summoned  by  sacrificing  two of the player's other monsters.
 
 Spell Cards 
 -  Spell Cards  may be played face-down or from the player's hand: if played face-down, they may be activated at any time during either player's turn. Spell cards played from the player's hand may only be activated during the player's turn.
 
 Trap Cards 
 -  Trap Cards  must be played face-down before activation, and cannot be activated the turn they are played face-down. The trigger for activation is indicated on the card.
 
 
 Yugi takes the first move, and both duelists draw 5 cards to start. The Rare Hunter sees he has already drawn two pieces of  Exodia , and all he needs is three more to defeat Yugi. Jonouchi wonders if Yugi can figure out the Rare Hunter"s strategy. Yugi sets a face-down card and  Summons   Gazelle the King of Mythical Beasts  in Attack Position, ending his turn. On the Rare Hunter's turn, he plays the  Spell Card   Graceful Charity  to draw 3 cards and discard 2. Yugi notes that  Graceful Charity  is a Hand exchange card. The Rare Hunter's hand now contains  Right Arm of the Forbidden One ,  Left Leg of the Forbidden One ,  Left Arm of the Forbidden One  along with  Stone Statue of the Aztecs  and two unknown cards. Jonouchi thinks that Yugi must defeat him before he builds Exodia. 
 The Rare Hunter Summons  Stone Statue of the Aztecs  in Defense Mode and ends his turn. Yugi thinks that  Stone Statue of the Aztecs  is a wall monster, deducing that the Rare Hunter is a "Turtle" style player. The Rare Hunter plans that Yugi will concentrate on destroying his monsters, giving him the time to gather the cards he needs. Yugi takes his turn, Summoning  Baphomet  and activating his  Face-down   Polymerization  to fuse his two monsters and Summon  Chimera the Flying Mythical Beast . Yugi then ends his turn (as Fusion monsters cannot attack on the turn they are summoned according to  Super Expert Rules ), but promises to destroy the Rare Hunter's  monster  next turn. The Rare Hunter is unconcerned, and begins his turn by playing another  Graceful Charity . This time, his hand contains two "Right Arms", which he notes would happen as he has three copies of all the pieces of Exodia. However, he also see he has four different pieces, and needs only one more to automatically win. Deriding Yugi in his head for thinking he could defeat the Rare Hunters, the Rare Hunter remarks how he wears X-ray contact lenses and has coated his cards with an ink that makes them see-through to his contacts, allowing him to see what cards he draws. Looking at his deck, he sees that his next card is the final piece of Exodia he needs, and thinks he will win on his next turn when he draws it.
 The Rare Hunter finishes his turn by summoning another wall monster,  Gear Golem the Moving Fortress . This puzzles Yugi, who notes that all the Rare Hunter has done is play defence while shuffling his hand. Knowing the Rare Hunter can't hope to cut down his  Life Points  like this, he wonders what his strategy is. All of a sudden, he snaps his fingers and thinks "I see." Out loud, he tells the Rare Hunter that he has figured out his strategy and tells him he won't allow him to Summon Exodia. The Rare Hunter is stunned that Yugi figured out his strategy, but then grins and asks what he can possibly do about it. Yugi holds up a card and tells the Rare Hunter he will crush Exodia with it.
