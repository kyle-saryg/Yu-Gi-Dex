"Dark Tuning" redirects here. For the card whose alternate name in the  anime  is "Dark Tuning", see " Wicked Rebirth ".   
 A  Dark Synchro Summon  is a method of Summoning a  Dark Synchro Monster . Both the Summon method and the monster category exist only in the anime and in the later members of the  Tag Force  series of video games. Its mechanics are somewhat the antithesis of a  Synchro Summon , as instead of requiring a  Tuner monster  whose  Level  is added to the Level(s) of a non-Tuner monster(s) to equal the  Synchro Monster 's Level, it requires a  Dark Tuner monster  whose Level is  subtracted  from the Level of a non-Tuner monster to equal the  Dark Synchro Monster 's  Negative Level . Therefore, in order to Summon a strong Dark Synchro Monster with a high Negative Level, the Dark Tuner must generally have a very high (positive) Level and the non-Tuner a very low Level, barring the activation of cards such as " Dark Wave ".
 
 Anime 
 In the anime, Dark Synchro Monsters have only been used by the  Dark Signers  and their possessed servants. When a character performs a Dark Synchro Summon, the Dark Tuner first transforms into its Level stars, which pierce the non-Tuner monster making it appear in pain. The non-Tuner monster then transforms into its own Level stars, which 'cancel out' some of the Dark Tuner's stars, disintegrating the non-Tuner monster in the process, which is shown to be excruciatingly painful for the non-Tuner monster.
 The remaining Dark Tuner's stars then turn black and spin in a circle, before merging into a column of darkness that reveals the newly Summoned Dark Synchro Monster. Each character recites a  Summon chant  while performing the Summon; while this generally varies between characters in the original Japanese anime, all Dark Synchro Summon chants have been the same in the dubbed anime: " When the shadows are devoured by even darker shadows, the curtain pulls back and reveals a world without light! " which is Roman Goodwin's Summon Chant in the Japanese version.

 Video games 
 In the  Tag Force  games, the first part of the Summon animation is skipped, and the dark stars appear from nowhere before spinning in a circle and merging as before.
 In  Duel Links , a Dark Synchro Summon is only a cosmetic change. So far, only three cards use the animation:  Hundred Eyes Dragon ,  Fortune Lady Every , and  Moon Dragon Quilla.
