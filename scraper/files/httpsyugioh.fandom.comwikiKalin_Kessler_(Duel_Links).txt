 Trivia 
 The inclusion of " Void Ogre Dragon " as card-specific dialogue comes from Kalin's usage of that card during the  D1 Grand Prix  in the  Yu-Gi-Oh! 5D's  manga. 
 When starting a Duel with  Yusei Fudo ,  Jack Atlas , or  Crow Hogan , Kalin announces "I did things to you that I regret... and can't take back." 
 When Kalin wins a Duel against Jack Atlas or Crow Hogan, he says "That was a satisfying Duel." 
 Kalin has the same dialogue when he Duels against  Dark Signer Kalin Kessler ,  Dark Signer Carly Carmine , and  Rex Goodwin .
 Starting the Duel: "To atone for my past, I must defeat the Dark Signers!" or "No need to remind me of my sins. I've never forgotten them." 
 Winning: "I will no longer run from my past." followed by "I will fight for those who have lost their freedom!" 
 Losing: "This is the price I must pay for my crimes."
 Kalin still possesses the aforementioned dialogue for the Dark Signers, even though he already has character-specific dialogue for Dark Signer Kalin Kessler. 
 Lumis and Umbra ,  Seto Kaiba (DSOD) ,  Mokuba Kaiba (DSOD) ,  Yugi Muto (DSOD) ,  Joey Wheeler (DSOD) ,  TÃ©a Gardner (DSOD) ,  Scud ,  Jesse Anderson , Yusei Fudo, Jack Atlas, Crow Hogan,  Akiza Izinski ,  Leo ,  Luna ,  Tetsu Trudge , Dark Signer Kalin Kessler, Dark Signer Carly Carmine, Kalin Kessler, and  Carly Carmine  have additional character-specific dialogue that is generic, due to having the same dialogue when Dueling against certain Legendary Duelists. 
 Yugi Muto (DM) ,  Espa Roba , Seto Kaiba (DSOD),  Aigami , Jesse Anderson,  Chazz Princeton ,  Jaden/Yubel ,  Axel Brodie , Yusei Fudo, Jack Atlas, Crow Hogan, Akiza Izinski, Leo, Luna, Tetsu Trudge, Dark Signer Kalin Kessler, Kalin Kessler,  Yuma and Astral ,  Reginald Kastle ,  Bronk Stone ,  Tori Meadows , and  Kite Tenjo  are the characters who possess a  Skill  that allows them to begin a Duel with copies of specific Monster Cards added to their Main Deck and/or Extra Deck. 
 The Paradox Brothers , Dark Signer Kalin Kessler, and Kalin Kessler are the characters who possess a Skill that allows them to begin a Duel with Monster Cards on the field, albeit at a significant cost. 
 The Paradox Brothers,  Arkana , Lumis and Umbra, Aigami,  Sera ,  Prana , Jesse Anderson,  Alexis Rhodes ,  Dr. Vellian Crowler ,  Bastion Misawa ,  Tyranno Hassleberry ,  Sartorius Kumar ,  Blair Flannigan , Yusei Fudo, Dark Signer Kalin Kessler, Kalin Kessler, and Reginald Kastle are the Legendary Duelists who have dialogue for cards that are non-existent, unreleased, anime-exclusive, or video game-exclusive. It is uncertain as to why these cards were found in the voice files, or if these said cards will be released in the future.
 Kalin's dialogue for such cards include: " Infernity Climber ", " Infernity Queen ", " Infernity Pawn ", " Infernity Sage ", " Infernity Shield Bearer ", " Infernity Spear Bearer ", " Infernity Zero ", " Contract with the Void ", and " Infernity Burst ". 
 The Legendary Duelists who, in descending order, share the same amount of card-specific dialogue with each other are:
 Jack Atlas and Crow Hogan 
 Joey Wheeler (DSOD),  Zane Truesdale , and  Syrus Truesdale
