 Ouroboros  (ουροβóρος) is Greek for "tail-devourer". The Ouroboros is an ancient symbol depicting a serpent or dragon swallowing its own tail and forming a circle. It has been used to represent many things over the ages, but it most generally symbolizes ideas of cyclicality, unity, or infinity, and has been frequently used in alchemical illustrations.
