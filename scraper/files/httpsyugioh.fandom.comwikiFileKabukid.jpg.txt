 Orlando , known as  Kabukid  (カブキッド,  Kabukiddo ) in the Japanese version, is a  Pro League  Duelist who treats his Duels as theater shows and only Duels to impress his audience. Orlando Duels against  Jaden Yuki  in the  Genex Tournament  only to be defeated and learn the true meaning to what a fun Duel actually is. His appearance ends with him giving a rather ridiculous, yet humorous victory dance to Jaden and company. On a side note, both  Crowler  and  Bonaparte  are adoring fans of Orlando.
 
       Orlando's Linework     
 His background story is altered in the dub where he is a Broadway actor claiming to have starred in plays such as "Deck Side Story" and "Duelist on the Roof" (puns of " West-Side Story " and " Fiddler on the Roof " respectively), while in the Japanese version, Orlando is a Professional  Cosplay  Duelist obsessed with traditional Japanese  Kabuki , a form of theater. He is also the champion of the international  Pro League .
 
 Deck 
 Orlando plays a  Kabuki Control Deck . His Deck is based on many aspects of traditional kabuki, especially the play Kanjinchou which contained Benkei, his lover Shizuka, and his opponent Yoshitsune. His " Kabuki Stage "  Field Spells  are interchangeable, and many of his cards utilize unique abilities that  activate  during battle. These effects are used to regain advantages quickly and work well in conjunction with the Field Spells. " Battle Claw Fox " can destroy monsters that attacks it, while " Shizuka the Heavenly Dancer " can heal Life Points under the same conditions. The strategies of his Deck refer to how kabuki and other plays are planned from the start, as he has the ability to control almost the entire Duel. His ultimate card, " Genghis Ghan the Emperor Dragon ", though its effect isn't used, can deal damage to the opponent when it is destroyed by a card effect.
