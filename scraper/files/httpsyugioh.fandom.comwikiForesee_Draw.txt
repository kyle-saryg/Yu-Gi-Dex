      Akiza  foresees her  draw .     
 Foresee Draw  ( 予見する引き札   Foresse Dorō ) is an ability  Akiza Izinski  possesses in the  manga . Using it she is able to predict what card she is about to  draw . [1] 
 
 Usage 
 Akiza always uses this ability during her  Duels , predicting correctly the card she is about to draw. [1] [2] [3] 
 During her Duel with  Sherry LeBlanc , Akiza used this ability to counter Sherry's  Hand Scan  ability. As Sherry would check the card Akiza had in her  hand  as soon as she looked it and  discard  it via the  effect  of her " Mokusatsu ", Akiza used her Foresee Draw to predict what card she was going to draw, and thanks to that, she didn't need to look to the card. By that way, Sherry wasn't able to scan Akiza's hand through Akiza's vision, and Akiza could save her card. However, Akiza was hesitating to use this ability in a  Turbo Duel ; it's dangerous, once Akiza closes her eyes when foreseeing her draw, which can cause her to crash with her  Duel Runner . However, she was able to keep on the course due to the help of her friends in the auditory. [4]
