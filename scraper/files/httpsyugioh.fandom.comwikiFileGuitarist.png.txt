 Biography 
 Birth of Rush Duels 
 Princess G appears in  Romin 's flashback when she sang on her concert and threw the card " Prima Guitarna of the Colorful Light " to her fans. Romin was the lucky catcher of the card.
 
 Goha 6th Elementary 
 Princess G was shown how she is a star guest in the famous TV show drama  Itame's Case Files: The Serial Sushi Murder Case, the Mystery of the Sliced Ginger Legend Left by the Striking Skipjack Tuna  as one of the three possible culprits. The episode in question was seen by Romin, who wondered what Princess G was doing on the drama show.
 Princess G was summoned by  Tops of Hexagon  in order to make a concert that will crush rush duels and promote more of the Goha duels. But, Princess G refused to do that stating that she loves rush duels and that they need to have more faith in kids potential which her statement leads her to be fired. Later on the news it was written that Princess G is retiring from her music carrier which was shock for  Romin  since she was her idol. Princess G went undercover in  Goha 7th Elementary  known as Purisaki Gibumi. She found out about Romin and her quitting of Rush duels. She gave her hints in order to stop Romin giving up from Rush duels. Also, Purisaki secretly put in Romin's deck another card named  CAN:D  in order to give her courage. Later, she was seen talking with  Mimi Atachi  knowing their real identities as she left with her motorbike saying that they need to have faith in the kids potential which made Mimi to think about it. 
 
 Deck
