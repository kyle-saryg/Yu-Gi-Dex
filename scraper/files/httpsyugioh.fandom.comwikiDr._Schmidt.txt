 Biography 
 Dark Signers 
 Yusei Fudo  is left severely injured after his  Shadow Turbo Duel  against  Kalin Kessler , as a shard is impaled in his stomach.  Crow  takes Yusei to  Martha 's refuge so that he can receive the required surgery. Here, Dr. Schmidt begins operating on him, assisted by Martha.
 He manages to save Yusei's life by removing the shard, along with its pieces from his body. Afterwards, he and Martha emerge from the operating room and tell everyone that Yusei is going to be okay once his wounds have sealed up, since the shard hadn't damaged any of his internal organs or blood vessels.
 After Yusei's fierce  Shadow Duel  against  Roman , which ended with  Martha  getting sacrificed in order to save Takya. The Signers and their companions are back in Martha's home, as Takya, Jun and Michan try to apologize to the Doctor. As Takya admits that it was his fault that she ended up like that,  Trudge  also takes the blame stating that he should have grabbed her on that particular moment. As everyone thinks that she's dead including the doctor, Yusei leads them to believe that in order to get her back along with everyone else, they just have to defeat the  Dark Signers . As everything thats been going on Satellite is because of their actions.
