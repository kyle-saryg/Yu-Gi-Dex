 Turn 3: Strings 
 Strings  draws " Worm Drake " and subsequently Normal Summons it (1400/1500) in  Attack Position . He then  activates  " Polymerization " to fuse "Humanoid Slime" with "Worm Drake" and  Fusion Summon  " Humanoid Worm Drake " (2200/2000) in  Attack Position . 
 Since  Fusion Monsters  cannot attack during the  turn  they are  Fusion Summoned ,  Strings   activates  his face-down " Quick Attack " to bypass that rule. "Humanoid Worm Drake" attacks "Gazelle", but  Yami Yugi  activates his face-down " De-Fusion " to return "Humanoid Worm Drake" to  Strings '  Fusion Deck  and  Special Summon  both "Humanoid Slime" (800/2000) and "Worm Drake" (1400/1500) in  Attack Position . A replay occurs, and Strings chooses not to attack.
 Turn 4: Yami Yugi 
 Yami Yugi  draws "Buster Blader". He then  Normal Summons  " Beta The Magnet Warrior " (1700/1600) in  Attack Position . "Beta The Magnet Warrior"  attacks  and  destroys  "Worm Drake" ( Strings  4000 → 3700). "Gazelle the King of Mythical Beasts"  attacks  and  destroys  "Humanoid Slime" ( Strings  3700 → 3000).
 Turn 5: Strings

Now during each of Strings' turns, A Slime Token will be Special Summoned to Strings' side of the field in Attack Position. If Strings summons any other monsters besides Slime Tokens, "Jam Breeding Machine" will be destroyed.
 Turn 6: Yami Yugi 
 Yami Yugi  draws. Yami Yugi's hand contains "Buster Blader", " Spellbinding Circle ", " Dark Magician ", and " Magical Hats ". He then  Tributes  "Beta The Magnet Warrior" and "Gazelle the King of Mythical Beasts" to  Tribute Summon  " Buster Blader " (2600/2300) in  Attack Position . "Buster Blader"  attacks  and  destroys  "Revival Jam". Since "Revival Jam" is  destroyed , it revives itself (1500/500) in Defense Position via its own effect.

He then  activates   Nightmare's Steelcage ". Now for two turns, no monsters on either side of the field can attack.
 Duel continues next episode. 
 
 Changes to the English Version 
 In the dub, Yami Yugi's transparent spirit looks around and senses a "darkness approaching" and then disappears, while in the original, although his spirit still looks around, it is Yugi who claims that something is coming after Yami disappears. 
 In the dub, Marik needs to defeat Yami Yugi in a duel in order to claim his puzzle and send him to the Shadow Realm. In the original Japanese version, Strings will simply immidiately hunt down and kill Yugi should he lose the duel. 
 Errors 
 When " Gazelle the King of Mythical Beasts " is summoned in the dub, its DEF is shown to be 2100. 
 When Strings draws " Worm Drake " in the dub, it is shown to be a Level 8 or higher monster instead of Level 4. 
 When Strings summons his first slime token, " Revival Jam " is not on his duel disk. 
 In the dub, when Strings sets a card (" Jam Defender "), " Jam Breeding Machine " is shown on his  Monster Card Zone  instead of "Revival Jam") 
 In the Japanese, when Buster Blader is in Yugi's hand, it is shown to be a level 6 monster instead of a level 7. This was corrected in the dub. 
 In the dub, when Strings activates " Polymerization ", a "De-Fusion" card appears instead. This is corrected on the DVD that includes the episode.
