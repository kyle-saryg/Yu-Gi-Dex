      An  anted  " Jinzo " and a Locator Card.     
 A  Locator Card , known as a  Puzzle Card  in the manga and Japanese anime, was a clear card with a prismatic coating containing a small portion of a map of  Domino City . There was one given to each participant of the  Battle City  tournament.
 Duelists wagered their Locator Cards in  Duels . The eight Duelists to collect six Locator Cards became finalists. If a player ran out of Locator Cards, they were disqualified. In the manga it was explained that there were exactly forty-eight Puzzle Cards issued, each containing one of the forty-eight components of the map in a 6x8 grid.
 By stacking the forty-eight cards a map of the city would be formed. In the manga, stacking six cards would at least create a partial map and a light would shine on one spot indicating the location of the finals. In the anime, by inserting six cards in a  Duel Disk  a holographic projection of the location of the finals would be produced.
 
 Trivia 
 There were 48 competitors in Battle City, but only 8 finalists. This means 40 people were eliminated.
