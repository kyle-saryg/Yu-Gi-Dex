 If we don't have it listed, then we mostlikely don't know it. 
 If you're just asking for the sake of curiosity, don't do it here. Do it on the  forum , please. Also, please sign your post by typing four tildes ( ~~~~ ).  Becasita   Pendulum   ( talk  •  contribs )  10:21, June 26, 2017 (UTC) 
 The episode list needs to be updated with the latest dub episodes. The dub has up to episode 124 done, but they're not listed on the page(and I can't figure out how to edit them in).
Also episode 118 doesn't have the english airdate or title listed here (but it is on the episode page).

 It just needed a null-edit. The episodes appear on the page after the dates are added to the episode pages themselves. Also, as a courtesy, would you mind giving a source for dub related edits in the future? You have NO idea how much incorrect stuff has been postulated for this dubbed season.

Alright, though I'm not sure if 'I watched the episode on Teletoon when it aired' really counts as a source ^^; Since, that's where I get my info(at least for airdates) from.
I know Teletoon's show schedule on their website lists the episode number and the title of the episode(and guide on the tv gives the title as well I think). Though it only shows a week at a time.

 Just add extra colons.
 Like so. 
 Anyways, just pop a link to Teletoon's schedule if it's still available (though I don't blame you if you're having trouble navigating that bloody thing), that'll do the trick. 
 Now, another thing, have you considered,  this ? Just to let you know.  Sanokal K-T  ( talk  •  contribs ) 06:05, January 9, 2018 (UTC)
