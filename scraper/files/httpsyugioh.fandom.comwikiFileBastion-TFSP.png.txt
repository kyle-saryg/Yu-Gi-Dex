 — Bastion Misawa's English Dub most famous quote 
 
 Bastion Misawa , known in Japan as  Daichi Misawa , is a highly analytic  Duelist  who resides in the  Ra Yellow  dorm at  Duel Academy . Bastion is a mathematical genius who covers his cards and the walls of his room with endless numeric formulas, believing that everything in life can be calculated arithmetically. The neglect of his character is a running gag throughout the series in the anime as well as in the manga version of GX.
 Originally a friend and sometimes rival of  Jaden Yuki , Bastion's role in the anime slightly decreases as each arc passes, although his role in the  manga  does not.

 Personality 
 Bastion is an intelligent, precise, stern Duelist with a genius-level intellect. His Deck was built with a formula that he made. In the anime, despite his keen intellect, Bastion later develops something of an inferiority complex in the latter half of the second season when other characters pay less attention to him as compared to the first season. He ends up going along with the Society of Light on the promise that joining the group will return him to the spotlight, but later leaves the organization of his own volition and is the only character shown on screen to leave the Society of Light under their own will power without having to first be defeated in a duel. 
 
 Design 
 Appearance 
         Bastion' design incorporates multiple layers of clothing and a wide range of expressions. Depicted here is the  Duelist  in full  Ra Yellow  regalia from front, side, and rear alongside views of his head from different angles.     
 Bastion's usual outfit consists of the standard Ra Yellow. His black hair is neatly arranged, with a large portion flushed back and slightly to his left, featuring different layers where the sloping changes direction. He carries an  Academy-issued Duel Disk  on his left hand.
 
 Voice and mannerisms 
 Despite his protests that such feelings are illogical and irrational, it is implied that Bastion has feelings for several female monster cards seen throughout the series, his primary crush being " White Magician Pikeru ", but it is implied that he is also crushing on other cards and other girls. For example, at the beginning of the  Genex Tournament , he couldn't attack " Familiar-Possessed - Hiita " because he liked her; similarly, when a doll named  Alice  showed up, he wished her to be with him instead of  Tyranno Hassleberry .
 In the dub, Bastion speaks with a posh British accent and occasionally mixes in British slang and exclamations such as "knackered." In the Japanese version, Bastion occasionally addresses  Jaden  as "Ichiban-kun" meaning "Number one". In the Spanish (Spain) dub he tends to use scientific terms during dueling such as comparing Decks to Theorems.
 
 Etymology 
 His given name in the Japanese version means "great intellect", reflecting his Dueling style and character.
 
 
 Biography 
 Seven Stars 
 Bastion came in as #1 in the entry examinations and is generally regarded as the best newcomer student. He and  Jaden Yuki  first met during the examinations, with Jaden referring to him as "#2," and himself as "#1." After seeing Jaden defeat  Dr. Crowler , Bastion himself agrees with these titles. He watches Jaden defeat Chazz and the Tag team battle with Jaden and  Syrus Truesdale  beating the  Paradox Brothers  telling  Alexis Rhodes  he is getting more impressed every day by Jaden's dueling skills.
 After defeating  Chazz Princeton  in a public Duel Bastion is offered entrance into  Obelisk Blue  but declines, saying that he promised himself he would not advance to Obelisk Blue until he was the #1 Duelist of the freshman class and in order to do so, he would have to defeat Jaden, who he viewed as #1. While Jaden, Syrus, and Chumley are looking for the  Duel Giant , Bastion tells them about  Beauregard . Bastion explains that Beauregard arrived at the Academy to become a game designer. Sometime later, he builds a seventh Deck, seemingly based off his Water Deck which is devoted to sealing certain cards so that an opponent will not be able to Summon most of his or her monsters. Bastion uses the seventh Deck against Jaden, preventing the use of " Polymerization " with " Cursed Seal of the Forbidden Spell ", therefore keeping Jaden from calling forth his stronger monsters but is still defeated when Jaden uses a combination of " Elemental Hero Wildheart " and " Cyclone Boomerang " to  destroy  his  Spell  and  Trap Cards .
 Due to his skill Bastion is one of the seven Duelists that receive a  Spirit Keys  to the  Spirit Gate  that can unleash the  Sacred Beast  cards. Bastion only Duels one of the  Shadow Riders ,  Tania . Although Bastion uses his " Magnet Warrior " monsters, which use opposing plus and minus charges to stop his opponent's attacks and fuse to become stronger, he loses. Afterward, he is stripped of his free will to a degree and becomes infatuated with Tania. He returns to normal after Jaden defeats her and she runs off, leaving her  Shadow Charm  behind. Sometime after  Amnael  is beaten, Chazz steals the keys for Alexis to date him. Due to stealing the keys, they awaken  Kagemaru , the leader of the Shadow Riders. Jaden beats him after a long Duel and life returns to normal. Bastion is present when Jaden duels  Zane  for the graduation match. The duel ends in a tie. He and the rest of the school congratulate Zane and Jaden on a amazing duel.
 
 Society of Light 
         Bastion in the  Society of Light     
 During the start of the year, he tells Syrus that he is being challenged to a duel by  Missy . Should he win, he will get granted to go to  Ra Yellow . Syrus wins causing him to join Bastion in Ra. At one point during the second year, angered by the fact that he was not considered for entry into the  Society of Light , Bastion challenges  Sartorius  to a Duel in order to prove his strength and disband the Society.  Chazz , however, takes Sartorius' place, and although Bastion has the means of being victorious, Sartorius takes advantage of his self-doubt and desire to be accepted, convincing him to intentionally lose to Chazz and finally join the organization. 
 Following his conversion, Bastion is relegated to the sidelines, watching helplessly as other Society members are given the opportunity to Duel  Jaden  and convert other school members into their group, while he himself is assigned no such tasks. He tries to show loyalty to the society by bleaching his hair white, but nobody notices him. When the  Genex Tournament  started, he tried to challenge  Prince Ojin  to a battle, but Sartorius battles the latter instead. After weeks of such torture, as well as a conversation with  Dr. Eisenstein  following Eisenstein's loss to Jaden, he becomes "enlightened" about his worth as a Duelist and as a person and leaves the Society of his own accord to pursue his goals.
 
 Dimension World 
 After leaving the  Society of Light , Bastion follows  Dr. Eisenstein  back to his laboratory and becomes his impromptu apprentice, helping him with an experiment in quantum mechanics. However, the experiment goes wrong, and Bastion is flung into the same alternate world that  Jaden  and his friends, as well as the entire  Duel Academy  main building, is pulled into after Jaden's Duel with  Thelonious Viper . There, he wandered the world for an indeterminate amount of time, until he was finally reunited with his friends. When  Blair Flannigan  is found injured, Bastion offers to help her get the medical attention she needs by locating a submarine he had spotted earlier in his travels, and attempting to use it to get her out of the campus building and to a hospital. After volunteering himself to Jaden and co.'s mission to rescue  Jesse Anderson , who was still trapped in an alternate dimension, Bastion meets up with  Tania  again, who herself was pulled in from her own dimension. The two wander around to protect the dimension's inhabitants. He later comes to inform Jaden about  Yubel's  plan to unite all 12 dimensions together and then urges Jaden to accept  The Supreme King  because The Supreme King is a part of his soul, and without him, he won't have the power to stop Yubel.
 
 Darkness 
 Bastion decides to stay in the alternate dimension with  Tania  which is where he is presumed to still be. However, among the silhouetted images of Duelists that  Nightshroud  shows to Jaden is one that strongly resembles Bastion. He was presumably restored after Jaden defeated  Nightshroud .
 
 Other appearances 
 In the  Yu-Gi-Oh! GX  manga , Bastion's role is larger than in the anime. He is considered one of the five best Duelists in his class.

 Decks 
         Bastion reveals his six Decks     
 Bastion has six Decks in the anime, one for each  Attribute , though only his  EARTH  and  WATER  Decks are ever seen. All his Decks are based on of scientific formulas and processes, and have various control elements to them. Bastion's WATER Deck focuses on " Water Dragon " while his EARTH Deck relies on " Magnet Warriors " and making monsters " Plus " or " Minus " monsters, which affects which enemy monsters they can  attack .
 Specifically to defeat  Jaden Yuki , Bastion builds a 7th Deck off of his WATER Deck, and negates Jaden's ability to fuse monsters by using " Cursed Seal of the Forbidden Spell " to forbid the usage of " Polymerization ".
 In the  Society of Light  arc, Bastion combines all his previous Decks together, but he is again only seen using cards from his EARTH and WATER Decks. Most of his monsters tend to be based off of scientific processes.
 
 Water 
 His  Water  Deck is a  Water Dragon Deck  which focuses on  Tributing  " Hydrogeddon " and " Oxygeddon " using " Bonding - H2O " to  Special Summon  " Water Dragon ".

 7th 
 Against Jaden Yuki, Bastion plays a  Water Dragon / Control  Deck, that focuses on countering Jaden's Deck by restricting the use of " Polymerization " via " Cursed Seal of the Forbidden Spell ". It is explicitly stated to be a separate Deck from his Water Deck in the Japanese version, which he calls his  7th Deck . No such distinction is made in the English dub (in the Spanish he makes a small reference to the fact that it's a new Deck, but not specifically naming it his 7th). This Deck is also seen at the beginning of  Episode 36 .

 Trivia 
         Bastion (Tiger) and Jaden (Chinese Dragon)     
 In the  first anime intro , Bastion is shown with his " Water Dragon " and a fire equivalent; however, this " Fire Dragon " made no in-series appearances. 
 Occasionally during episodes that specifically pit Bastion against Jaden, a picture of a tiger and Chinese dragon, respectively, would appear. These two creatures are represented of the Tao philosophy of Yin and Yang, with the Tiger being Yin, and the Dragon being Yang; similarly, they represent the dichotomy between Bastion's calm, calculated, and orderly way of Dueling, and Jaden's more hectic, impulsive, and erratic Dueling style. Coincidentally, the  Shadow Rider  Tania, whom Bastion falls in love with, has a pet tiger, and is eventually revealed to be a tiger herself. During Duel Monsters Spirit Day, Bastion dresses up as " Amazoness Tiger " as a tribute to her. This further ties Bastion in with the Tiger of Yin symbolism. 
 While most people in the Society of Light were completely loyal and devoted to Sartorius, Bastion expressed a wish to challenge him. He did this multiple times, and he also chose to leave the Society of his own will and seems to remember his time in it. This makes it probable that Bastion was never brainwashed by Sartorius and retained his own personality, unlike the rest of its members who were brainwashed into servitude and only left the Society after being freed from it. 
 Chazz is the only named Duelist that he won against.
