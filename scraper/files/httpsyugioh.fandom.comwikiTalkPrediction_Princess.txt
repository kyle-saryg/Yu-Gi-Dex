 Think I found something worth noting: all the Sibyls are named after types of fortunetelling. Tarotray, Crystalundine, and Ouijamorrigan should be pretty obvious. Coingnoma is a coin toss. Petalelf could mean petal reading, or simply "he loves me, he loves me not" (which fits Mieru very well). Arrowsylph is probably the most obscure, most likely belomancy (look it up).
 Worth noting?
