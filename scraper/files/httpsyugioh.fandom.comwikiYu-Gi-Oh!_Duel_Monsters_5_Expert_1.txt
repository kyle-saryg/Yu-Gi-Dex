 Yu-Gi-Oh! Duel Monsters 5 Expert 1  is a video game for the  Game Boy Advance , and the first game to follow the real  OCG / TCG  rules. The game is very similar to its English version ( Yu-Gi-Oh! The Eternal Duelist Soul ) in the story, but different in the graphics and the Booster Packs (The Eternal Duelist Soul uses the same graphic as  Yu-Gi-Oh! Worldwide Edition: Stairway to the Destined Duel ). Gameplay is similar to standard dueling rules, except that the Side Deck can have less than 15 cards, and is more for convenience of getting to cards for your Deck than switching between duels, as CPU duels are single duels rather than matches (though you will have a match duel against a character every two weeks on a Saturday).

 Gameplay 
       Main Menu     
 Opponents are arranged in "tiers," with higher tiers unlocked by beating already open tiers.  A tier may consist of 4 or 5 duelists.  In order to advance, all duelists on a tier must be beaten a certain amount of times before the next level can be unlocked.  Beating a tier also unlocks certain in-game events, such as special cards that can only be received by beating that tier.
 
       Deck edit     
 Another important aspect of the game is the in-game calendar.  On certain days of the week (not actual days, as the game does not support a real date function) in game, random events may occur, such as recieving a pack of cards in the mail or being challenged to a Match by an opponent.
 This is the first game to include  Polymerization  as an actual card. It also includes the  Egyptian God Cards , though they are completely unusable, as the game considers them illegal.

 Cards 
         Duel Field     
 As the game progresses, more and more cards unlocked that can be used for your Deck.  There are over 900 unlockable cards; beating a certain level or even particular duelists will unlock new Booster Packs or reward the player with rare cards. Like many previous and later Yu-Gi-Oh! games, it also used the 8-digit passwords printed on most cards to unlock new cards.  Cards are kept in a chest where they can be accessed at any time, and may be placed in the Deck or Side Deck. Fusion cards that are added to the Deck do not go toward the 40 card minimum, and are used in the Fusion Deck. The game follows the banned list created at the time of the game.

 Cheats 
 Getting The Egyptian God Cards 
 The  Egyptian God Cards  are not legal in this game; they also don't have a password, so the only way to get them is from their packs.
 Obelisk The Tormentor :
 You can obtain  Obelisk The Tormentor  from  Duel Finalist  Booster Pack.
 The Winged Dragon of Ra :
 You can obtain  The Winged Dragon of Ra  from  V-Jump Magazine .
 Slifer The Sky Dragon :
 You can obtain  Slifer The Sky Dragon  from  Millennium Puzzle Gold  Booster Pack.
 
 Other Cheats/Hints 
 Beat  Simon  once to get 1 copy of every card not already in your possesion. 
 If you would like to play your duel at a faster pace than normal, hold R button down during the Janken game. Once the duel starts you can let go. The game will now be twice as fast as normal. 
 When a die roll initiates, hold B to make the number higher or A to make the number lower. This works almost every time. 
 Once you play  Graverobber , set the chosen Magic Card instead of immediately activating it. Once the card is set, activate it and you will not lose the 2000 Life Points. 
         Trade     
 To duplicate a card, trade with a friend. When you go to trade,  one  person pushes the trade button; when their card appears back on their screen, the other person pushes the trade button. Both players will now have the original and traded cards. 
 Password System 
         Password Machine     
 Passwords can be found on the lower left hand corner of actual physical  Yu-Gi-Oh!  cards. In this and many other games, a password screen allows these codes to be entered to unlock new cards.  However, there are two conditions to this:
 
 Certain rare cards will not allow their passwords to be entered, unless the condition to unlock them has been met but the game has not awarded it yet. 
 The player must not already have the card in his/her Trunk,  Deck ,  Side Deck  (or if the card is a newer card), it will not go through and it will display an "ERROR" message. 
 D-Tactics 
         D-Tactics     
 D-Tactics is a special function only found in  Duel Monsters 5 Expert 1 .
This function helps you learn the basics of the game. Doing these will
help you learn how duels go, how to fuse, and so on. You should
do this before playing Campaign mode.
 
 Rules in D-Tactics 
 There are some rules in D-Tactics.
 1) The level will pick a Deck you use. You will use the same Deck each
time you play that level.
 2) You will start out with basically the same hand. (Some unimportant 
cards will be different)
 3) You MUST win in one turn.
 4) When you select a level, it will tell you a hint, so read it carefully.
 5) Don't give up. Some levels are hard, but not impossible.
 
 Progressing in D-Tactics 
 In the beginning, you can only access 6 levels. Once you beat
those 6, the next 6 levels will be available. Once you beat those 6, 
6 more levels will be available. This will go on until you have all the 
levels.
