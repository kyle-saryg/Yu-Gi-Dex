Ryoga and Luna are also working to wipe out the Numbers. Meanwhile, Yagumo joins forces with with Dr. Faker and declares war on Yuma and their friends! The Numbers War begins!

 Astral's design was the first I completed for "ZEXAL". He's the character I have the greatest attachment to. And Miyoshi-kun's Astral looks great! [2] 
 
 Message from Shin Yoshida 
 With the anime over, I have a bit more time, so I put together a deck for a staff tournament and got whooped! I'm going to study up and get revenge! [2] 
 
 Message from Naohito Miyoshi 
 My right hand has been sore, and it turns out I have tendinitis! I didn't think I was overworking it, but… Anyway, I can still hold a pen without any problem! Guess that means I have to get back to work! Haha! [2]
