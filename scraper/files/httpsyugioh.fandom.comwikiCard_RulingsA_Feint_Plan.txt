 Previously Official Rulings 
   These TCG rulings were issued by  Upper Deck Entertainment  and have since been deemed unofficial by Konami. [1]  They were previously considered official and can still be correct, as long as they follow the official gameplay rules, or unless Konami has issued a ruling that says otherwise. References:  [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] 
 
 If " A Feint Plan " is activated and you control only  face-down  monsters, your opponent cannot attack any of your monsters and they cannot attack your  Life Points  directly either. 
 If you activate " A Feint Plan " after your opponent declares an attack against one of your  face-down  monsters, that attack  resolves  as normal, but they cannot attack other  face-down  monsters for the remainder of the turn. (This is because " A Feint Plan " prevents declaring an attack against a  face-down  monster, and the attack has already been declared by the time " A Feint Plan " resolves during the  Battle Step .)
