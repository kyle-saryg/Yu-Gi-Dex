 Mechanics 
 During their  Main Phase , if the game state is open, the  turn player  can Link Summon a Link Monster from their Extra Deck by sending  face-up  monsters they control equal to the Link Monster's  Link Rating  to the  Graveyard  as  Link Materials . After that, the Link Monster is Summoned in either an  Extra Monster Zone  or a  Main Monster Zone  that a Link Monster on the field  points to , in face-up  Attack Position .
 When using a Link Monster for a Link Summon, it can be treated as 1 Link Material, OR multiple Link Materials equal to its own Link Rating.
 
 Example 
 Example A: Standard Link Summon 
 A monster (1) (" Stack Reviver ") +  A monster (1) (" Backup Secretary ") + A monster (1) (" RAM Clouder ") = A Link-3 Link Monster (" Decode Talker ") 
 Example B: Using Link Monster(s) as Link Materials 
 A Link-3 Link Monster (3) (" Decode Talker ") + A Link-3 Link Monster, used as 1 monster (1) (" Encode Talker ") = A Link-4 Link Monster (" Firewall Dragon ") 
 Anime 
 In the anime, using monsters to perform a Link Summon is known as  Setting the  Link Arrows .
 For the first few episodes, when a Link Summon was performed, the Duelist shot forward a burst of energy which created an Arrowhead portal in the sky which the Duelist and their monsters flew through. The Link Materials then transformed into red and white streaks of energy that entered the appropriate Link Arrows, causing them to turn red. The Link Arrows are then said to have their circuits combined. The portal then glowed white and energy converged to form the monster and the Link Arrows around it. The monster and the Duelist then emerged from the Arrowhead portal. 
 If a Link Monster is being used for a Link Summon by using its Link Rating, then copies of that monster will appear equal to the Link Rating of the monster and enter the appropriate Link Arrows.
 The color of the area that a Duelist enters to Link Summon differs, and may depend on the monster's Type, Attribute or Link Rating.
 Since this first summoning sequence may have appeared repetitive, lengthy, and unconventional when performed outside of  Speed Duels , an alternative depiction of Link Summoning started to appear from  episode 14  onwards, first used by  Emma Bessho/Ghost Gal .
 
 The circuit of " Link Bumper " The circuit of " Honeybot " The Arrowhead portal for " Altergeist Primebanshee " from episode 14 
 Since then, this style of Link Summoning is used by all other Duelists to have the Arrowhead portal appear on the field wherever the he or she wishes to manifest it. The monsters used for the summoning then transform into different colored hurricanes and then shoot towards the Link Arrows. At times, the Link Material Monsters may enter the portal instead of shooting towards the Link Arrow, presumably activating the Link Arrows from within the portal like in the original summoning sequence.
 Unlike previous summoning methods in the anime, the Duelist states the summoning conditions of the Link Monster before calling out the monsters he/she is using to summon it.
 From  episode 31  (during the Duel between  Varis  and Ghost Gal), each time Varis performs a Link Summon, the monsters he uses as materials become bullets (instead of becoming hurricanes) that then impact the Link Arrows.

 Trivia 
 Link Summoning is the first Summoning method since  Fusion  ( Synchro ,  Xyz , and  Pendulum Summoning  being the others) to not explicitly involve  Levels  in its Summoning procedure.
