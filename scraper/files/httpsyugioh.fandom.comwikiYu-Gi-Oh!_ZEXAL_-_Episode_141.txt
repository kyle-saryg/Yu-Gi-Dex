 Summary 
 Pointing at  Don Thousand ,  Yuma  declares that he's  activating  the second  effect  of the " Utopia Rising "  equipped  to " Number 39: Utopia ". This will allow "Utopia" to see any effects that " Number 100: Numeron Dragon " and " Number 73: Abyss Splash " have that are activated by  detaching   Overlay Units  . Thousand seems surprised at the effect (these events are cut from the dub, as they took place in the previous episode). Yuma detaches an Overlay Unit from "Utopia" to activate the effect of "Numeron Dragon". He asks  Kite  to lend him his strength. Kite's spirit appears beside him and they explain the effect in unison - the monster will gain 1000  ATK  times the combined  Ranks  of every  Xyz Monster  on the  field . The total is twenty-three, so the ATK of "Utopia" rises to 25,500. Thousand is incredulous at the ATK gain, but points out that it still falls far short of the ATK of " Chaos imaginary Number 1000: Numeronius Numeronia ". Yuma tells him he's not done - "Utopia" still has Overlay Units. 
 
       Yuma  and  Nash  declare the  effect  of " Number 73: Abyss Splash ".     
 Yuma and  Nash  stand back to back and declare that the effect of "Abyss Splash" can double the monster's ATK for each Overlay Unit detached. They detach both now, thus quadrupling the ATK of "Utopia" to 102,000.  Tori  cheers that they managed to exceed the ATK of "Numeronius Numeronia". Yuma declares his  attack , but Thousand calls him a fool. His hand glows with pink energy as he raises it up and reveals that he can detach an Overlay Unit from "Numeronius Nummeonia" to  negate  an attack and gain  Life Points  equal to the attacking monster's ATK. Red lightning strikes push "Utopia" back and Thousand's Life Points rise 102,900. He asks if they understand yet - no matter what mortals do, they cannot reach the power of a god. Yuma asks if he's sure about that. He claims their ray of hope has not yet been extinguished. Nash adds that the power of their bonds will see them through and  Astral  specifies that there is power in believing in others. Thousand shouts "it can't be!". (This scene is cut from the dub, with Thousand saying that there is no way they can overcome the power of a deity, and Yuma responding with "Oh yes, there is!" immediately before the following scene.) 
 
       Yuma  activates  " Double or Nothing! ".     
 Yuma declares that this is their final hope and activates his  face-down  " Double or Nothing! ", as an attack was negated. This will double the monster's ATK and allow it to attack again. Spectral forms of " Number 39: Utopia Roots ", " Chaos Number 39: Utopia Ray ", " Chaos Number 39: Utopia Ray Victory " and " Chaos Number 39: Utopia Ray V " appear around the base "Utopia" as its ATK rises to 204,000. Thousand claims this is impossible. Yuma, Nash, Kite and Astral simultaneously declare that "Utopia" fights alongside the power of their bonds and that that is the true power of the King of Wishes  (in the dub, the scenes with the Duelists talking are cut, but the voices are still heard). The four spectral forms each strike a blow before the Duelists declare, "the clinching blow,  Rising Sun Hyper Force Slash ". "Utopia" bisects "Numeronius Numeronia",  destroying  it. Thousand is blasted back by the resulting explosion, screaming as his Life Points fall to 0.  
 
       Remants of  Don Thousand 's power and his " Numbers " are absorbed by Nash.     
 Tori hops up and down cheering. Yuma declares that they finally defeated Don Thousand. He turns to Kite's spirit and mutters his name. Kite turns to him, but simply smiles before vanishing. Yuma thanks him for his help. Looking up, they see the gateway to the  Astral World  closing. Tori approaches Yuma and tells him to turn around. Clouds begin to cover  Heartland City  and Astral muses that the fusion between  Earth  and the  Barian World  appears to have stopped. Thousand is still flat on his back from the final attack. He mutters that it's impossible that he was defeated. Yuma claims his scheme has completely failed now. Thousand laughs raucously and a ball of Barian energy appears above his body. He says that even with his destruction, his true curse has not yet been lifted. He adds that they'll understand soon. His body is consumed by the energy ball, but his voice rings out and reminds that  Chaos  is the source of life itself - therefore, it is infinite. He finishes by saying that Nash already understands this (in the dub, Thousand claims they only destroyed his body, not his spirit and that as long as his spirit exists, the fight will not end). The ball of energy disperses into the sky, while Don Thousand's disembodied voice laughs, prompting Tori to ask what's going on. From the orb in the sky comes a rain of " Numbers " infused with Barian energy. They are are absorbed by Nash. Yuma yells " Shark !", but Nash, now glowing with energy, tells Yuma and Astral that he can't let them get these "Numbers" (in the dub, Nash instead tells them that the battle isn't over - it hasn't even begun). His eyes glow red and Yuma, Astral and Tori are thrown through a portal, with Yuma and Astral splitting back from  ZEXAL III  in the process.
 
         The arena between the  Barian  and  Astral Worlds .     
 When they regain consciousness, they find themselves in a small room surrounded by pillars, while  Baria  and  Astralite  crystals float about. Before them is a winding staircase, which leads straight into the Astral World, the  Astral Tower  visible. Yuma says it can't be. Turning, Yuma sees another staircase leading to Earth - which is still fused with the Barian World. Yuma asks what's going on - they should have saved the world by beating Thousand. Nash appears behind them in his human form, saying that Earth and the Barian World are still merged - and they're currently in a small place between that merged world and the Astral World. Yuma mutters "Shark..." Nash explains that right now, the two worlds are pulling against one another. If it keeps up, the two worlds will collide, resulting in the Astral World's destruction. Yuma says he doesn't get it - they beat Don Thousand. Astral turns to Nash and says "it can't be because you..." (Astral's line is cut from the dub. Nash confirms Astral's thoughts - this is the result of him absorbing Don Thousand's power). Yuma asks why he'd do that and Tori asks if Don Thousand's wasn't his enemy too (in the dub, Tori suggests he use Don Thousand's powers to stop the worlds from crashing). Nash reminds them that he is a  Barian  warrior - making him their enemy, regardless of Thousand's influence. Nash comments that the Astral World was created by all the souls throughout the universe that desired to  Rank-Up . In trying to do so, they threw away everything "bad", which included Chaos, resulting in the expansion of the Barian World (in the dub, Nash responds to Tori's statement by saying that he could, but there's no way he will. He reminds them that the Barian World and the Astral World are sworn enemies and adds that when he became the leader of the Barians, he inherited a responsibility to protect the Barian World - and it's a responsibility he takes very seriously). 
 
         The three suns.      Nash compares his world to the Astral World's table scraps, but says he cannot abandon it. All of his other friends are in the Barian World - friends who can never be replaced. Yuma begins to argue, but Nash claims it doesn't matter - Astral's mission is to use the  Numeron Code  to extinguish the Barian World. Yuma says there must be a way to let both worlds coexist  Nash says that is impossible. Astral agrees, revealing that the Astral World has become so weak that if the worlds became one, it would simply vanish. Nash muses that they can travel down one path or the other - only one world will survive. Yuma asks if they really fought all this time for it to end like this. Nash claims it is their fate. Yuma refuses to believe it - he knows that everyone can learn to understand one another. Yuma recalls that Don Thousand's spell hasn't been broken yet. Nash says that it can never be broken. Looking up at the three suns that now occupy a space in the sky, he explains that though Thousand interfered with the lives of the other  Seven Barian Emperors  and altered their memories, he did nothing to Nash. He reveals that he became a Barian of his own free will, because of the people he was close to already having been taken to that world upon death. Yuma is in disbelief. Nash says that he still considers Yuma and Astral friends, but if they stand in his path, he will take them down - he cannot abandon the other Barians. He claims that Thousand's true curse is Nash's very existence. Yuma stutters, but Nash continues, saying that when he decided to become a Barian again, Reginald "Shark" Kastle died. (in the dub, the scene is shortened and the suns do not appear. Yuma refuses to fight Nash and Nash claims they are not friends as long as Yuma takes Astral's side. Astral simply says he agrees with Shark for once - the worlds cannot coexist). Nash asks they settle things once and all. Yuma mutters "Shark...", but Astral says they should do it - they've always found their answers in Duels. Yuma agrees and Nash says both Yuma and Astral's names then Yuma sets his  D-Pad , while Nash  Barian Battlemorphs  and Yuma dons his  D-Gazer . They all yell "Duel!". 
         " Doppelganger Shark " duplicates " Number C101: Silent Honor DARK ".     
 Nash takes the first  turn . He activates " Card of Ascension ", which lets him  send  a  monster  in his  hand  to the  Graveyard  to  add  a " Rank-Up-Magic " card from his  Deck  to his hand. He sends " Friller Shark " to add " Rank-Up-Magic - The Seventh One ", He activates it now, Special Summoning " Number 101: Silent Honor ARK " from his  Extra Deck  in  Attack Position . "The Seventh One"  Ranks it Up " and he Special Summons " Chaos Number 101: Silent Honor DARK " in Attack Position, who appears twirling its spear. Next, he  Normal Summons  " Doppelganger Shark ", revealing that when he does so, he can target a  WATER  monster he  controls  to treat "Doppelganger Shark" as having the same name. He  targets  "Silent Honor DARK", prompting "Doppelganger Shark" to change its appearance to match it. Nash adds that the targeted monster can also attack  directly . Nash now activates " Chaos Barrier ". As he controls two " C " monsters with the same name, neither can be targeted for attacks, destroyed by card effects or  banished . Astral tells Yuma this is bad for them - if things stay as they are, he can attack directly for 2800 damage every turn. Nash ends his turn by  Seting  two cards.
 
         Yuma and  Astral  discuss the  Numeron Code .     
 Yuma asks Astral if they'll really find an answer in this Duel - is there a future they can find that will save everyone? Tori mutters the names of both Yuma and Astral. Astral tells him there may be a way to solve all their problems - the Numeron Code. He reminds Yuma that the winner of this Duel will become its owner - and it can rewrite the past and future. Yuma asks if he's serious. Astral says he is - everything that's happened could be undone. Yuma muses that they may be able to use the Code's power to save everyone who was killed (the people who were killed are not specifically mentioned in the dub). He asks Astral if that's a real future though. What kind of future would result from their running away from all the times they had together - the moments that they fought tooth-and-nail against their foes and grew closer to one another? Yuma says they fought to grasp their own future. Astral agrees with him - there wouldn't be any value in a future not won. Astral reveals that before he would have used the Code without any hesitation, but he's not so sure now - that is why they must Duel. Astral says this Duel will be his own " kattobingu " (in the dub, Astral agrees that they shouldn't use the Code, but he adds that they have to fight to save the Astral World. He believes that if anyone can find a solution to save all three worlds, it would be Yuma). Yuma agrees - they'll be able to find a solution through this Duel. Yuma tells Astral to "kattobingu", while Yuma figures things out. 
 Yuma begins his turn by Special Summoning " Buzzbuzz Seven ", explaining that he can do so when his opponent controls an  Xyz Monster  (the explanation is not present in the dub). Next, he Normal Summons " Gagaga Magician " and activates its effect, changing its  Level  to 7. He overlays his two Level 7 monsters to  Xyz Summon  " Number 11: Big Eye " in Attack Position. He activates the effect of "Big Eye", detaching an  Overlay Unit  to take control of an opponent's monster. "Big Eye" shoots out waves of energy and "Silent Honor DARK" vanishes from Nash's field and reappears on Yuma's. Yuma adds that "Big Eye" can't attack the turn he uses this effect. Yuma activates the effect of "Silent Honor DARK',  attaching  "Doppelganger Shark" to it as an Overlay Unit. "Silent Honor Dark" twirls its spear before absorbing "Doppelganger Shark" in a beam of energy. Yuma orders a direct attack. The attack throws Nash back, but he lands on his feet and steadies himself with one hand as his Life Points fall to 1200. 
 
         Dumon 's spirit appears as Nash remembers him and  Marin .     
 Nash claims he knew they'd do something like that - the damage he took was all part of his plan to assemble the seven "Numbers" of the Seven Emperors. He activates his face-down " Duo of the Seven Emperors " as he received  battle damage  from the attack of a " Chaos Number " monster. He can Special Summon " Chaos Number 102: Archfiend Seraph " and " Chaos Number 103: Ragnafinity ". As the two monsters appear, he adds that their effects are negated. Astral muses that he played a card that directly supports the " Over-Hundred Numbers ". Yuma wonders if he really read their move that far ahead and Sets a card to end his turn. 
 
         The scythe of " Number C103: Ragnafinity " streams towards " Number 11: Big Eye ".     
 Nash draws and urges  Dumon  and  Marin  to aid him. Their spirits briefly appear in front of their respective monsters. He orders "Ragnafinity" to attack "Big Eye", who throws her scythe, obliterating "Big Eye" in an explosion and reducing Yuma to 3800 Life Points. Nash then tells "Archfiend Seraph" to attack "Silent Honor DARK", prompting the former to throw its spear into the chest of the latter. Nash declares that the effect of "Silent Honor DARK" activates now since it was destroyed while it had Overlay Units. It's Special Summoned to Nash's field and he gains Life Points equal to its ATK. Nash roars as "Silent Honor DARK" infuses him with energy from its spear. Tori gasps as his Life Points return to 4000. Nash orders "Silent Honor DARK" to attack directly. Astral urges Yuma to activate something now, prompting Yuma to Special Summon " Gagaga Gardna " from his hand via its own effect as he's being attacked directly. It appears in Attack Position and a  replay  occurs, so "Silent Honor DARK" attacks and destroys "Gagaga Gardna". Yuma is thrown backwards and he and Astral scream, their Life Points falling to 2400. Tori yells their names as Nash Sets a card and ends his turn (in the dub, Nash quips that Yuma is the luckiest guy in the galaxy). 
 
         " Gagaga Clerk " and " Gagaga Caesar ".      Yuma rises to his feet and yells that he's not done yet - they haven't found their answer (in the dub, Yuma replies that lucky is better than good). Yuma draws and then Normal Summons " Gagaga Caesar ". As he controls a " Gagaga " monster, he Special Summons " Gagaga Clerk " from his hand via its own effect. He then activates the effect of "Caesar", banishing a monster from his Graveyard to change the Levels of all "Gagaga" monsters he controls to that of the banished monster. He banishes "Magician", thus changing the Levels of "Caesar" and "Clerk" to 4. He overlays his two Level 4 monsters to Xyz Summon " Number 39: Utopia " in Attack Position. Yuma  equips  "Utopia" with " Utopia Sword ", increasing its ATK by 800. Yuma orders "Utopia" to attack "Silent Honor DARK" with " Rising Sun Lightsword Slash ". "Utopia" bisects "Silent Honor DARK" before following with a flurry of slashes, ending with a thrust to the chest (the final thrust is cut from the dub). "Silent Honor DARK" explodes and Nash's Life Points fall to 3500. Astral reveals that when the equipped monster destroys an opponent's monster  by battle , they can  send  the equipped card to the Graveyard to destroy all other monsters on the field. "Utopia Sword" glows and "Utopia" slashes twice more, destroying "Archfiend Seraph" and "Ragnafinity". "Utopia" rears back and the sword vanishes. 
         " Utopia " and the three " Chaos Over-Hundred Numbers ".     
 Yuma asks "Shark" what he thought of that, with Nash responding that it's exactly what he expected. Yuma sputters "What?", while Nash activates his face-down " Chaos Hundred Universe ". He reveals that this card Special Summons all the " Chaos Over-Hundred Numbers " that were destroyed this turn to his field, but negates their effects. The three monsters rise back up from the Graveyard portal. Then, he can Special Summon an equal number of "Chaos Over-Hundred Numbers" from his Extra Deck to  Yuma's  field in Defense Position, also with their effects negated. Yuma gasps, while Nash Special Summons " Chaos Number 104: Umbral Horror Masquerade ", " Chaos Number 105: Battlin' Boxer Comet Cestus " and " Chaos Number 106: Giant Red Hand " to Yuma's field. Astral wonders why he'd Summon them to their field. Nash draws and activates his face-down " Hundred Summon " as he controls three or more "Over-Hundred Numbers". This lets him Special Summon another "Over-Hundred Number" from his Extra Deck with its effects negated. He Special Summons " Chaos Number 107: Neo Galaxy-Eyes Tachyon Dragon " in Attack Position. Yuma says that all seven "Chaos Over-Hundred Numbers" are on the field now. Astral mutters "Shark", but then corrects himself and calls him "Nash" (in the dub, Astral instead says that he fears the worst). Nash asks them both to bear witness to his true power as a Barian.

         " Number iC1000: Numeronius Numeronia " is  destroyed .     
 Duel continues from  the previous episode . 
 Turn 8: Nash 
 Yuma  activates the " Number 100: Numeron Dragon "-granted effect of " Number 39: Utopia " to increase its  ATK  by the total number of  Ranks  on the  field  times 1000 by detaching an Overlay Unit ("Utopia": 2500 → 25500 ATK, 3 → 2 ORU). Yuma then activates the " Number 73: Abyss Splash "-granted effect of "Utopia" twice to double its ATK twice by detaching two Overlay Units ("Utopia": 25500 → 51000 → 102000 ATK, 2 → 0 ORU).
 "Utopia"  attacks  " Chaos imaginary Number 1000: Numeronius Numeronia ", but  Don Thousand  activates the final effect of "Numeronius Numeronia" to detach a  Chaos Overlay Unit ,  negate  the attack and gain  Life Points  equal to the attacking monster's ATK (Don Thousand: 900 → 102900 LP). As an attack was negated, Yuma activates his  face-down  " Double or Nothing! " to double the ATK of "Utopia" ("Utopia": 102000 → 204000 ATK) and allow it to attack again. "Utopia" attacks and  destroys  "Numeronius Numeronia" (Don Thousand: 102900 → 0 LP).
 
 Yuma Tsukumo vs. Nash 
         The fight for the " Numbers " ends as it began.     
 Turn 1: Nash 
 Nash  draws. He then  activates  " Card of Ascension " to  send  " Friller Shark " from his  hand  to the  Graveyard  and  add  a " Rank-Up-Magic - The Seventh One " (a " Rank-Up-Magic " card) from his  Deck  to his hand. He then activates "Rank-Up-Magic - The Seventh One" to Special Summon " Number 101: Silent Honor ARK " ( 4/2100/1000) from his Extra Deck in  Attack Position  with its effects negated and the summoning conditions ignored. Nash then uses "Rank-Up-Magic - The Seventh One" to  Rank-Up  "Silent Honor ARK" via Chaos Xyz Evolution in order to Xyz Summon " Chaos Number 101: Silent Honor DARK " ( 5/2800/1500, ORU: 1) in Attack Position.
 Nash  Normal Summons  " Doppelganger Shark " ( 4/1000/1000) in Attack Position. As it was Normal Summoned, Nash activates the effect of "Doppelganger Shark" to target "Silent Honor DARK" (a  WATER  monster) and treat it as having the same name as the targeted monster and allow it to attack directly. Nash then activates " Chaos Barrier " to target "Silent Honor DARK" and "Doppelganger Shark" (as they are " C " monsters with the same name) and prevent them from being attacked,  banished  and being  destroyed  by card effects. Nash  Sets  two cards.
 
         Yuma  with " Buzzbuzz Seven " and " Gagaga Magician ".     
 Turn 2: Yuma 
Yuma draws. As Nash controls an  Xyz Monster , Yuma Special Summons " Buzzbuzz Seven " ( 7/700/700) from his hand in Attack Position via its own effect. He then Normal Summons " Gagaga Magician " ( 4/1500/1000) in Attack Position. Yuma then activates the effect of "Gagaga Magician" to change its  Level  to 7 ("Gagaga Magician":   4 → 7). Yuma overlays "Buzzbuzz Seven" and "Gagaga Magician" in order to  Xyz Summon  " Number 11: Big Eye " ( 7/2600/2000, ORU: 2) in Attack Position. 
 Yuma then activates the effect of "Big Eye" to detach an  Overlay Unit  ("Big Eye": 2 → 1 ORU) and take control of "Silent Honor DARK" at the cost of "Big Eye" being unable to attack this turn. Yuma activates the third effect of "Silent Honor DARK" to attach "Doppelganger Shark" to it as an Chaos Overlay Unit ("Silent Honor DARK": 1 → 2 ORU). "Silent Honor DARK" attacks directly (Nash: 4000 → 1200 LP). As he took damage from a  battle  involving a " Chaos Number " monster, Nash activates his  face-down  " Duo of the Seven Emperors " to Special Summon " Chaos Number 102: Archfiend Seraph " ( 5/2900/2400) and " Chaos Number 103: Ragnafinity " ( 5/2800/2400) from his Extra Deck in Attack Position with their effects negated. Yuma Sets a card.
 Turn 3: Nash 
Nash draws "Chaos Hundred Universe". "Ragnafinity" attacks and destroys "Big Eye" (Yuma: 4000 → 3800 LP). "Archfiend Seraph" attacks and destroys "Silent Honor DARK" (Yuma: 3800 → 3700 LP). As "Silent Honor DARK" was destroyed while it had Chaos Overlay Units, Nash activates its second effect to revive it ( 5/2800/1500) in Attack Position and gain  Life Points  equal to its ATK (Nash: 1200 → 4000 LP). "Silent Honor DARK" attacks directly, but Yuma activates the effect of " Gagaga Gardna " (as a direct attack was declared) to Special Summon it ( 4/1500/2000) in Attack Position. A  replay  occurs and "Silent Honor DARK" attacks and destroys "Gagaga Gardna" (Yuma: 3700 → 2400 LP). Nash Sets a card.
 
         " Utopia " destroys " Silent Honor DARK " with " Utopia Sword ".     
 Turn 4: Yuma 
Yuma draws. He then Normal Summons " Gagaga Caesar " ( 3/1800/600) in Attack Position. As he controls a " Gagaga " monster, he Special Summons " Gagaga Clerk " ( 2/400/800) in Attack Position via its own effect. Yuma then activates the effect of "Gagaga Caesar" to banish "Gagaga Magician" from his Graveyard and change the Levels of all face-up monsters he controls to that of the banished monster ("Gagaga Caesar":   3 → 4, "Gagaga Clerk":   2 → 4). Yuma overlays "Gagaga Caesar" and "Gagaga Clerk" in order to Xyz Summon " Number 39: Utopia " ( 4/2500/2000, ORU: 2) in Attack Position. Yuma then  equips  "Utopia" with " Utopia Sword ", increasing its ATK by 800 ("Utopia": 2500 → 3300 ATK). "Utopia" attacks and destroys "Silent Honor DARK" (Nash: 4000 → 3500 ATK). 
 As the equipped monster destroyed a monster  by battle , Yuma activates the second effect of "Utopia Sword", sending it the Graveyard ("Utopia": 3300 → 2500 ATK) to destroy all other monsters on the  field . As " Chaos Over Hundred Number " monster(s) were destroyed, Nash activates his face-down " Chaos Hundred Universe " to Special Summon all "Chaos Over Hundred Number" monsters destroyed, plus an equal number of other "Chaos Over Hundred Number" monsters to Yuma's field. Nash Special Summons "Silent Honor DARK" ( 5/2800/1500), "Archfiend Seraph" ( 5/2900/2400) and "Ragnafinity" ( 5/2800/2400) to his field in Attack Position, and " Chaos Number 104: Umbral Horror Masquerade " ( 5/3000/1500), " Chaos Number 105: Battlin' Boxer Comet Cestus " ( 5/2800/2000) and " Chaos Number 106: Giant Red Hand " ( 5/2600/2000) to Yuma's field in Defense Position.
 
         Nash 's " Chaos Over-Hundred Numbers " stand before Yuma.     
 Turn 5: Nash 
Nash draws. As he controls three or more "Over Hundred Number" monsters, Nash activates his face-down " Hundred Summon " to Special Summon " Chaos Number 107: Neo Galaxy-Eyes Tachyon Dragon " ( 9/4500/3000) from his Extra Deck in Attack Position with its effects negated (as it's a "Over Hundred Number"), but it will be  returned  to the Extra Deck during the  End Phase .
