 " Rush Duel Resignation ", known in Japan as " Goodbye, Student Council President! " is the fourth episode of the  Yu-Gi-Oh! SEVENS  anime. It aired in Japan on April 25, 2020 and in the US on June 7, 2022.
 Gavin  had been feeling unsure about whether he should acknowledge  Rush Duel  as legitimate or not. One morning, as part of his daily routine, he tried to predict his fortune by drawing a card. The card he drew was his ace monster,  Yameruler . This gave him an idea...
 
 Featured Duel: Yuga Ohdo vs. Gavin Sogetsu 
 The Duel is conducted as a  Rush Duel .
 Turn 1: Gavin Sogetsu 
Gavin draws " Fiendish Commander Yameruler ". He  Sets  a monster. He then sets 2 cards. 
 Turn 2: Yuga Ohdo 
Yuga  Normal Summons  " Dark Sorcerer " (Level 4/1500/0), " Fire Golem " (Level 3/1200/800) and " Whispering Fairy " (Level 2/800/1200). "Dark Sorcerer" attacks and destroys Gavin's Set monster, which is revealed to be " Turtle Keeper of Traditions " (Level 1/0/1400). "Fire Golem" and "Whispering Fairy" attack Gavin  directly  (Gavin: 4000 → 2800 → 2000 LP).
 Turn 3: Gavin Sogetsu 
As Gavin has two cards in his hand, he draws three cards. He Sets two monsters, then Tributes them to  Tribute Summon  "Fiendish Commander Yameruler" (Level 8/2500/2500). Gavin activates " Bandaged Bowing "; letting him switch 1  Attack Position   Warrior  monster he controls to  Defense Position  to draw a card. He switches "Yameruler" to Defense Position. Gavin activates the effect of "Yameruler" as it was Normal Summoned this turn, letting him change its battle position to prevent both players from Tribute Summoning Level 7 or higher monsters until the end of Yuga's next turn. "Yameruler" switches to Attack Position. He Normal Summons " Binding Chain " (Level 3/1000/1100), then Tributes it to Tribute Summon " Mountain Hermit Yur " (Level 6/0/2000). 
 Gavin activates his set " Shield & Sword ", switching the original ATK and DEF of all monsters on the field until the end of the turn ("Yameruler": 2500/2500 → 2500/2500, "Mountain Hermit Yur (anime)": 0/2000 → 2000/0, "Dark Sorcerer": 1500/0 → 0/1500, "Fire Golem": 1200/800 → 800/1200, "Whispering Fairy": 800/1200 → 1200/800). "Mountain Hermit Yur (anime) (anime)" attacks and destroys "Fire Golem" (Yuga: 4000 → 2800 LP). "Yameruler" attacks and destroys "Dark Sorcerer" (Yuga: 2800 → 300 LP). 
 Turn 4: Yuga Ohdo 
As Yuga has two cards in his hand, he draws three cards. He Tributes "Whispering Fairy" to Tribute Summon " Sevens Road Witch " (Level 6/1600/1000). Since Yuga Normal Summoned a monster while Gavin controls 2 or more face-up Level 5 or higher monsters, Gavin activates his set " Scroll of Simultaneous Salutations ", letting him return one monster he controls to the hand to switch all Attack Position monsters he controls to Defense Position. Gavin returns "Mountain Hermit Yur (anime)" to his hand and switches "Yameruler" to Defense Position. Yuga activates the effect of "Sevens Road Witch", letting him send 1 card from his hand to the  GY  to Special Summon 1 Level 7 or higher  DARK   Spellcaster  monster fron his hand. He sends " Stray Familiar " to the GY and Special Summons " Sevens Road Magician " (Level 7/2100/1500) in Attack Position. 
 Since he Special Summoned "Sevens Road Magician" with its effect, "Sevens Road Witch" gains 400 ATK ("Sevens Road Witch": 1600 → 2000 ATK) until the End Phase. Yuga activates the effect of "Sevens Road Magician", sending the top card of his Deck (" Hydro Magician ") to the GY to increase the ATK of "Sevens Road Magician" by 300 for each different Attribute in his GY until the End Phase ("Sevens Road Magician": 2100 → 3600 ATK). "Sevens Road Magician" attacks and destroys "Yameruler". "Sevens Road Witch" attacks Gavin directly (Gavin: 2000 → 0 LP).
