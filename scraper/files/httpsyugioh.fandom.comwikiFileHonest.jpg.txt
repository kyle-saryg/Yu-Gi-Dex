 Biography 
 After  Yusuke Fujiwara 's parents died, the Duel Spirit Honest appeared to Yusuke and promised to protect him. As he watched over the young Yusuke, he would always refer to him as his "master." 
 During his time at  Duel Academy , Yusuke had placed  Honest 's card inside a box before performing a black magic ritual in order to rid himself of all the painful memories he had suffered since the death of his parents.
 After Yusuke's disappearance in the  Abandoned Dorm , Honest took on the appearance of Yusuke and went to Duel Academy to search for Yusuke. Whenever someone asked who he is, Honest used his hypnosis to make them think they've always been friends. One day while collecting defective cards that didn't respond to Duel Disks Honest noticed the cards were infected by  Nightshroud  and tried to destroy them, causing  Trueman  to chase him.
 Jaden Yuki  appeared and rescued Honest while still in disguise. After defeating Trueman, Jaden asked who he was In an attempt to protect his identity, Honest attempted to hypnotize Jaden just like everyone else but Jaden's powers obtained from  Yubel  protected him from the hyponsis, forcing Honest to flee.
 While researching information on Yusuke Fujiwara,  Axel Brodie  revealed there no student enrolled in Duel Academy under this name, but the name was listed under students who disappeared in the Abandoned Dorm.
 He later reappeared in the Abandoned Dorm's Duel Arena, where Jaden identified him as Honest. Honest was fatally wounded by Trueman as he sacrificed himself to protect Jaden. After his sacrifice, Jaden received the "Honest" card to use in his third rematch against Trueman.
 Honest later appeared to the Nightshroud possessed Yusuke and tried to convince Yusuke to remember the past, when he had friends. Yusuke denied having memory of Honest and such events.
 After Jaden defeated Yusuke, Honest exorcised  Nightshroud  from Yusuke's body. Jaden also returned the "Honest" card to its rightful owner before leaving  Duel Academy .
