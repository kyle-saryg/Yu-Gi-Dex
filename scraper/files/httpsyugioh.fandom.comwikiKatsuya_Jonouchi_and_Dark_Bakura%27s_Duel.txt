 Katsuya Jonouchi  and  Dark Bakura , faced each other in a  Shadow Game  of  Duel Monsters , in the  Yu-Gi-Oh!  manga . The Duel took place in the  World of Memories , during the  Shadow RPG  and was used by Dark Bakura to distract  Yugi Mutou  and his friends from helping  the Pharaoh .
 
 Events 
 Yugi Mutou and his friends had entered the World of Memories as non-player characters, in the Shadow RPG. When the Pharaoh was about to lose a ka battle to  Bakura, King of Thieves , Yugi arrived and gave strength to the pharaoh, allowing him to Summon  The Sun Dragon Ra [1]  and win the battle. This caused the RPG's timeline to diverge from the original timeline. However Dark Bakura got the  High Priest of Darkness  to rewind time via  Memory Reverse . [2]  The portion of Dark Bakura's soul in the RPG then confronted Yugi and his friends to stop them interfering this time. He demonstrated how they could make  Duel Disks  form on their arms and challenged them to  Shadow Games  of  Duel Monsters , in which the losers would die. Jonouchi volunteered to face him first. [3] 
 Dark Bakura's turn 
 Dark Bakura  Summoned  " Death Spirit Zoma ". [3] 
 Jonouchi's turn 
 Jonouchi  Summoned  " Panther Warrior " and used it to  attack  and  destroy  "Zoma". However this activated the effect of "Zoma", who when destroyed turned into ectoplasm and possessed the opponent. It targeted Jonouchi with the intention of eating his soul. [3] 
 Elsewhere the Pharaoh was knocked unconscious by Thief Bakura, causing his memories to cease and the world to fall into darkness. By the time the darkness lifted, the Duel had stopped and Dark Bakura had left. [4]
