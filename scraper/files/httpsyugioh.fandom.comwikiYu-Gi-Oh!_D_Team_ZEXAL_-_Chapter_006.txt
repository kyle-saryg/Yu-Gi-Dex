 Featured Duel: Yuma Tsukumo vs. ESPer Robin 
 Turn 1: Yuma 
 Yuma 's starting  hand  contains " Tasuke Knight ", " Kagetokage ", " Magic Cylinder ", " Battle Break " and " Silver Sentinel ". He  draws  " Heartfelt Appeal ". Yuma  Normal Summons  "Tasuke Knight" (1700/100), and  Special Summons  "Kagetokage" (1100/1500) from his hand via its own  effect . Yuma then  Overlays  his two  Level  4  monsters  to  Xyz Summon  " Gagaga Cowboy " (1500/2400) in  Defense Position . He  activates  its  effect ,  detaching  one  Xyz Material  to inflict 800  damage  to Robin (Robin 4000 → 3200). Yuma  Sets  a card.
 Turn 2: Robin 
 Robin 's starting hand contains " D.D. Esper Star Sparrow ", " Beast-Warrior Puma ", " Phoenix Beast Gairuda ", " Ironhammer the Giant " and " Mind Pollutant ". He draws " D.D. Jet Iron ". Robin  sends   "D.D. Esper Star Sparrow", "Beast-Warrior Puma", "Phoenix Beast Gairuda", and "Ironhammer the Giant" from his hand to the  Graveyard  to  Special Summon  "D.D. Jet Iron" (4000/0) from his hand in  Attack Position . Next, he  Tributes  "D.D. Jet Iron" to Special Summon "Beast-Warrior Puma" (1600/1000), "D.D. Esper Star Sparrow" (3000/1500), "Ironhammer the Giant" (900/3500) and "Phoenix Beast Gairuda" (2500/1200) from his Graveyard, all in Attack Position expect for "Ironhammer the Giant". "Phoenix Beast Gairuda"  attacks  and  destroys  "Gagaga Cowboy", while "D.D. Esper Star Sparrow" attacks Yuma  directly  (Yuma 4000 → 1000). Robin declares a direct attack with "Beast-Warrior Puma", but Yuma activates his  face-down  " Heartfelt Appeal ", taking  control  of "Ironhammer the Giant" until his next  End Phase .
 Turn 3: Yuma 
Yuma draws " Mirror Force ". He Sets 4 cards. During the End Phase, "Ironhammer the Giant" returns to Robin's  field .
 Turn 4: Robin 
Robin activates " Galaxy Queen's Light ", making all of his  monsters  become  Level  10 until the End Phase. He Overlays "Ironhammer the Giant", "Beast-Warrior Puma" and "Phoenix Beast Gairuda" to Xyz Summon " Superdimensional Robot Galaxy Destroyer " (5000/2000) in Attack Position, and activates its effect, detaching an Xyz Material to destroy all 4 of Yuma's face-down  Spell / Trap Cards . "D.D. Esper Star Sparrow" attacks Yuma directly, but Yuma activates the effect of "Tasuke Knight" in his Graveyard, Special Summoning itself (1700/100) and ending the  Battle Phase  since Yuma has no cards in his hand. During the End Phase, the effect of Yuma's "Silver Sentinel" activates; since it was destroyed while it was Set as a Spell Card, it Special Summons itself from the Graveyard (1500/1300) and destroys "D.D. Esper Star Sparrow".
 Turn 5: Yuma 
Yuma Overlays "Tasuke Knight" and "Silver Sentinel" to Xyz Summon " Number 39: Utopia " (2500/2000).
