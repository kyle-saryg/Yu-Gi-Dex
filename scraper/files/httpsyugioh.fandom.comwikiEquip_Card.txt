 Mechanics 
 See also:  List of Equip Spell Cards 
 Equip Spell Cards  are the most common type of Equip Card; they are both  Spell Cards  (for purposes such as " De-Spell ") and Equip Cards (for purposes such as " Gearfried the Swordmaster ").
 Equip Cards constantly  target  the monster they are equipped to; even while  negated , Equip Cards remain equipped and continue to target the monster. If the equipped monster is no longer face-up on the field, or is no longer a valid target, the Equip Card is immediately destroyed. This destruction is  not  treated as destruction by a card effect.
 Equip Cards can be equipped to monsters  controlled  by either player, and  changing control  of a monster does not cause control of an Equip Card to change. While the equipped monster can be the opponent's, the Equip Card's  controller  is the one referred to as "you" in the Equip Card's  card text , not the controller of the equipped monster.
 
 Treating cards as Equip Cards 
 Main article:  Treated as Equip Card 
 Monster Card 
 If a  Monster Card  is equipped to another monster, it is treated as an Equip Spell Card and moved to a  Spell & Trap Card Zone . While treated as such, it cannot be destroyed by card effects that destroy monsters, but can be destroyed by effects that destroy Spell Cards. If a monster that is treated as an Equip Spell Card is sent to the Graveyard, it is not treated as being sent to the Graveyard as a monster, but becomes a monster again when it is in the Graveyard. [1] 
 A monster treated as an Equip Card cannot have its  equip target changed  by other  card effects [2] , except  Union Monsters  equipped by their own effects. [3]  Union monsters are the only group of monsters that consistently, through the wording of their effects, treat themselves as  Equip Spell Cards  while equipped.
 Equipped cards are still on the field, so effects or conditions that rely on a card "being sent from the field to the Graveyard", such as " Felgrand Dragon ", still apply. (This is because they activate in the Graveyard, where they are monsters now, and not on the field.) Despite this, unless stated otherwise, Monster Cards cannot activate or apply their effects while treated as Equip Cards, as they are not monsters.
 
 Pendulum Scale & Effect 
 Main articles:  Pendulum Scale  and  Pendulum Effect 
 Pendulum Scales are only applied if a  Pendulum Monster  card is in the leftmost/rightmost  Spell & Trap Zone  by being placed as a Pendulum Scale in the  Pendulum Zone . Treating them as an Equip Card and placing them in these zones will not apply their  Pendulum Scale  and  Pendulum Effects , and the Zone would not be treated as a Pendulum Zone.
 
 Link Arrows 
 Main article:  Link Arrow 
 A Link Monster's Link Arrows are only active if it is used as a Monster Card. If it is used as an Equip Card and placed in any Spell/Trap Zone, then its Link Arrows are not applied, and do not point to any zone or card.
 
 Trap Card 
 If a  Trap Card  is equipped to a monster, it is treated as both an Equip Card and a  Trap Card . For example, an equipped " Blast with Chain " can be  destroyed  by " Remove Trap " (since it is a Trap Card) and by " Gearfried the Iron Knight " (since it is an Equip Card), but not by " De-Spell " (since it is not a Spell Card). This type of Trap may be thought of as an "Equip Trap Card", but this is not an official term.
