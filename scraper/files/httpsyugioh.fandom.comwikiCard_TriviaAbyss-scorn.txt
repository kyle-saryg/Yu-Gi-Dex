 The monster in this card's artwork appears to be " Mermail Abyssdine ". 
 This card's name is a portmanteau word of "Abyss" and "Scorn".
 It's also a play on words, since the soft R in Japanese makes it sound like "Cone", referring to the suckered cones that  sea angels  (which "Abyssdine" is based off of) use to feed.
