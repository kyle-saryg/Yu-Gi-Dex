 Biography 
 History 
 Not much is known about Hunter's past, other than he apparently suffered an embarrassing loss to  Jack Atlas  on his path to become King. [3] 
 
 Yu-Gi-Oh! 5D's 
 A silhouette of Hunter was shown when  Lazar  was explaining how race, gender and a person's background doesn't matter when entering D1 Grand Prix tournament to Yusei. [4] 
 Hunter was present at the D1 Grand Prix opening ceremonies where he watched  Rex Goodwin 's introduction to the tournament and greedily smiled when Rex mentioned the prize money. When it was announced the first Duel of the tournament was to be Yusei vs.  Greiger , Hunter showed great disappointment at having to wait. [3]  During Yusei and Greiger's Duel, he was shocked when Greiger almost performed a  One Turn Kill . He also commented that Yusei's reason for Dueling Jack in order to reclaim his pride was nonsensical. [5]  Hunter laughed to himself when he thought " Blaze Fenix, the Burning Bombardment Bird " had defeated Yusei. The impact of Yusei's  Sense  shocked Hunter when it destroyed Greiger's Duel Runner [6]  which made him laugh. [7] 
 When  Tetsuo Trudge  won his Duel, Hunter showed annoyance at a  Sector Security  member being in the tournament. [8]  Prior to his Duel with Yusei, Hunter and his gang snuck in and took out the accelerator from Yusei's Duel Runner, preventing it from speeding up. In his Duel with Yusei, Hunter used his monsters to stop Yusei from attacking him and using his  Sense , calling it his "100% Defense Mod". He also revealed to Yusei that he paid a large amount of money to  someone high up  in order to be placed against Yusei and that he formulated his Deck to counter Yusei's Cross Sense. [1]  However despite the advantage Hunter had, Yusei managed to win the Duel with a One Turn Kill consisting of " Catapult Warrior " and a powered up " Junk Blader ". As Hunter lays down on the floor after his embarrassing loss, he looked up to see Yusei glaring at him. Hunter told him that if he had something to say he should just say it and asked if Yusei has a problem with him. Yusei just smiled at Hunter and thanked him for the Duel, infuriating Hunter even more. [2] [9] 
 
 Deck 
 Hunter  uses a  Stall Deck , primarily through high  DEF   monsters  that  negate   attacks  such as " Signal Vehicle ". His Deck was formulated to counter  Yusei Fudo 's Cross  Sense  and focuses more on the speed aspect of  Turbo Duels  rather than  Life Points  reduction. [1]
