 Trivia 
 With the inclusion of various "security"-related cards, this character's Deck is somewhat based on his Deck in the  anime .
 " Blocker " here is mostly likely a reference to " Gate Blocker ", a card that this character used in the anime (but wasn't released in the  OCG  at the time). 
 " Soitsu " here is most likely a reference to this character's incompetence in never succeeding to arrest  Yusei Fudo . 
 " Cyber Commander ", " Eatgaboon ", " Gatekeeper ", " Guardian of the Throne Room ", " Metal Guardian ", " Troop Dragon ", " De-Spell ", " Nightmare's Steelcage ", " The Reliable Guardian ", " A Hero Emerges ", " No Entry!! ", " Reinforcements ", " Security Orb ", and " Two-Pronged Attack " are likely included as references to  Sector Security .
 The Japanese card name of "Eatgaboon" translates to "Mousetrap", which is apparently Japanese slang for a " speed trap ". 
 "Two-Pronged Attack" here, whose Japanese card name translates to " Pincer Attack ", is most likely a reference to a possible tactic used by security forces.
