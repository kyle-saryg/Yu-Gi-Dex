A card's  Status  is a term showing how many copies of that card are allowed in a player's combined  Main Deck ,  Extra Deck , and  Side Deck  for official Duels. Statuses are announced every several months in the  Forbidden and Limited lists .
 The following Statuses are used in the lists:
 
 Unlimited  - up to three copies, the maximum, are currently allowed. 
 Semi-Limited  - up to two copies are currently allowed. 
 Limited  - only one copy is currently allowed. 
 Forbidden  - no copies are currently allowed. This status is only used in the  TCG   Advanced Format  and in the  OCG ; Forbidden cards are changed to Limited in the  TCG   Traditional Format . 
 The Yu-Gi-Oh! [FANDOM] also covers the following statuses:
 
 Legal  - the card can be used in an official Duel. Since all Forbidden, Limited, Semi-Limited, and Unlimited cards are also legal, this status is reserved on the Yu-Gi-Oh! Wikia for legal cards that are not also any of the above four statuses. (This applies mainly for release  Token Monsters ; see the  legal  article for more information.) 
 Illegal  - the card is not and never will be legal anywhere. All official illegal cards have  limitation text  present on the card, usually stating "This card cannot be used in a Duel". 
 Not Legal  - the card is only legal in certain regions; outside of those regions, they are considered  not legal  (see the article for more information). 
 Not Yet Released  - the card has a confirmed future release date. Any copies that may be leaked will be not be considered legal until then. 
 Not Yet Legal  - the card has been officially released but will not be considered legal until some time in the future.
