Not that I'm complaining, but I'm surprised that  Victory Dragon  isn't illegal (although close to it).-- Dragonking  23:34, 19 November 2008 (UTC)
 Why are all of the "If this card reduces your opponent's Life Points to 0, the controller wins the match" ones illegal? I'm not, you know, savvy, but doesn't reducing their live points to 0 win the match anyway?  Dorsha  22:56, 15 February 2009 (UTC)
 
 No, that would win the duel. A match is the best 2 out of 3. So you'd win two duels for the price of 1 by the effect of those cards. -- Bluedog  ( Talk ) 22:59, 15 February 2009 (UTC) 
 Oh, wow. I'm sorry, I just don't keep up with the terms and whatnot. Thanks!

 Kanan and Firewing Pegasus... 
 Are those two actually illegal? I mean, they're obviously illegal in the TCG since they're Asian English, but surely they're legal in the OCG.
 
 Difference between Forbidden and Illegal 
 So, I understand that Forbidden cards are merely forbidden from being added to your Deck, while Illegal is outright forbidden from even being considered a playable card. Are there any specific situations where that difference manifests itself?
 
 Forbidden cards are considered Limited in the Traditional format, while Illegal cards connot be used in any tournaments unless stated (mainly only casual tournaments). 
 Should Ally of Justice - Catastor belong here 
 Since it isn't legal to use  Ally of Justice Catastor  in TCG Gameplay because it hasn't been released through other means (except through the Duel Terminal), on the Konami Forums [currently the forums are in LIMBO] it had been confirmed that Catastor cannot be used legal in the TCG Gameplay because it hasn't be released through other means (Deus Ex Mechina can help confirm this as well) ~MEOW~ Might of the BIRD Empire~~  04:54, 9 July 2009 (UT
 
 Forbidden Card List 
 Everybody can use any card that they want to use NO MATTER WHAT! And this Forbidden/Illegal card list is just bunch of bull crap. I bet the list was created by some nerds who are Jealous because they cannot get them. - By: X

 We should delete it. Discuss?
 
 Add cards 
 Shouldn't  Stardust Divinity  and  Grizzly, the Red Star Beast  be added to this list? I would do it, but this article is protected.  Shrev64  ( talk  •  contribs ) 20:22, August 15, 2010 (UTC)Shrev64
 
 Obelisk redirect 
 Can someone fix the redirect to the  Obelisk the Tormentor (original)  card? Lol I know it seems pretty straightforward, but a few friends are accusing me of using an "illegal" Obelisk card (the effect version) just because the link on this page redirects to the legal version... :P  Thrashmeister  ( talk  •  contribs ) 01:50, August 25, 2010 (UTC)
 
 I second this.  It is misleading.  In fact it should specify the old version.  Same goes for The Winged Dragon of Ra.-- DarkMastero  ( talk  •  contribs ) 02:48, August 25, 2010 (UTC) 
 King of Destruction - Xexex 
 Dunno if this happen to the other or just myself, but " King of Destruction - Xexex " appear twice on the list. Might be an error on the page itself or on the database, though. --  Aeris Ventaile  ( talk  •  contribs ) 15:25, May 2, 2011 (UTC)
 
 Adding [[Class 1::Official]] fixed it when nothing else would, but I find that an undesirable fix personally - SMW seems to have a cache somewhere that it refuses to update for some reason. Xexex is also listed twice on  Cards based on Konami video games , and there are probably other places as well.  「 ダイノ ガイ 千？！ 」 ?  ·  ☎ Dinoguy1000  17:01, May 2, 2011 (UTC) 
 Egyptian God Promo Cards Missing? 
 I'm not seeing the Egyptian God Promo cards anywhere on this list. Should they be added in? ( Peelster1  ( talk  •  contribs ) 20:15, June 27, 2014 (UTC))
 
 Question 
 Why is there a double up of "This card cannot be used in a Duel." on each card stated? Just wondering. {{SUBST:User:Ellis99/sig}} 05:28, October 20, 2014 (UTC)
 
 Glitch in SMW coding. We're hoping to get it fixed within this month or the next. -- UltimateKuriboh  ( talk  •  contribs ) 05:43, October 20, 2014 (UTC)
