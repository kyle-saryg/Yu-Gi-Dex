 Summary 
 
 This section  may require  cleanup  to meet this wiki's standards.   You can help out by re-organizing or re-writing parts of it or checking grammar and spelling.   
 Alarms ring at Heartland Museum, as a robbery has just taken place. Police forces in front of the museum are lighting up the roof with a huge spotlight, to illuminate the culprit, who gets surrounded by half a dozen of officers with laser swords. The culprit pulls a Duel Monsters card out of his sleeve, holds it up high, and a sudden blast of thunder appears.
 Kari Tsukumo , at her home computer monitor, sees something is happening at the museum. She hacks, and sees a picture of the culprit. Her D-Gazer's phone function goes off, and the man calling, who's the culprit, is identified by Kari as  Charlie McCay , who makes her blush. She continues to chat, until she gets all fired up at Charlie, and has a flashback, in which she remembers Charlie kissing her (this scene is cut from the dub).
 Yuma Tsukumo , followed by  Tori Meadows  and  Astral , is all fired up for another round of Dueling in the  WDC . Kari calls him, ordering him to find Charlie through her usual manner of "asking" Yuma things.
 They hear shouting from a little square, and head off to it. Over there,  Reginald Kastle  finishes a Duel using his " Submersible Carrier Aero Shark ". Yuma goes of to congratulate Shark and says he's happy that Shark is participating after all. Shark tells him he's doing to get revenge on  Quattro  for what he did during the Nationals, and before Yuma can ask any further, Shark leaves.
 In an alleyway,  Kite Tenjo 's " Galaxy-Eyes Photon Dragon " unleashes a final  Photon Stream of Destruction  on 2 opponents. Kite uses  Photon Hand  from both of his arms to take both of their souls and he extracts a " Number " card from each one.
 Yuma and Tori are walking through a crowd of people. Yuma thinks about what Shark said before, and Tori spots Charlie McCay, who Kari ordered them to find.
 Yuma introduces himself rather boldly to Charlie, who's rather surprised to hear Yuma's last name of Tsukumo.
 
       Charlie's  Duel begins.     
 Charlie hears Yuma out and gets to hear Kari ordered them to look for him. He pulls out a card out of his coat, and a  big muscular Duelist  seeing this asks him if he's a Duelist, challenging him. Yuma is surprised, asking Charlie if he's in the WDC, who confirms it.
 At  Heartland Tower ,  Mr. Heartland  reports Kite's progress in the  Numbers Hunting  to  Dr. Faker , and tells him about the amount of Numbers located, after which Faker recites his plan.
 At Charlie's Duel, Charlie is a huge pinch. He has no monsters, and only two Set cards, while his opponent controls three  Xyz Monsters , and he has only 100 LP left compared to his opponent's full 4000. Yuma tells him this, but Charlie seems calm, and draws his card, which is " Reload ", so he returns his whole hand to his Deck and then draws the same amount of cards as returned. He uses his spell " Triple Ace " to Special Summon three " Dice Levelers " (the dots representing the die numbers are removed in the dub). Using their effects, he rolls a dice for each one to increase its Level by the rolled amount. All three rolls yield the result of 6, which Yuma, Tori, and Astral are amazed by, as this is very improbable.
 
       " Daigusto Phoenix ", " Thunder End Dragon " and " Kachi Kochi Dragon ".     
 Charlie  overlays  his three monsters which are now Level 7, to Xyz Summon his  Number , " Number 7: Lucky Straight "! A roulette machine appears, which is Number 7's sealed form, which turns into its full form. Using his " Dream Dice ", Charlie rolls a dice. As its result is 6, all of his opponent's monsters will have their Attack Points reduced to 0 by the cards effect. Again, Charlie rolls 6 for the fourth time in a row, doing so. He attacks with "Lucky Straight", and activates its effect, and the dice roll that follows will multiply the ATK of "Lucky Straight" by the amount rolled. It lands on a 6 for the fifth time, and "Lucky Straight" obliterates the opponent's LP as a result. Yuma, Tori, and Astral are amazed by Charlie's gameplay, and his opponent says he must've cheated as it's impossible to roll a 6 so many times.
 Charlie laughs, and a spotlight drops on him, it being a police helicopter doing so. Police cars suddenly surround the square, and a whole bunch of police officers approach Charlie, who appears to put his hands up high. Charlie pulls out his "Number" card, which releases a sudden gust of wind, whipping open numerous people's deck holders and even blowing away 1 of Yuma's " Numbers ". However, this also causes the  Do! Do! Donut  sign to fall. People flee from the area of impact, but Charlie remains where he is. He ends up being unharmed, as he stood in the exact center of the sign. Charlie thanks Yuma for his " Number 11: Big Eye " card (in the dub, he instead tells Yuma to apologize to Kari for him for leaving her), and leaves quickly. Kari comes riding up the the stairs with a motorcycle just after Charlie escaped.
 Kari explains their father and Charlie's history together, and the 2 decide to work together on finding him, promising each other to do 'kattobingu'.
 Astral tells Tori and Yuma about something he remembers Charlie saying, and they instantly go to where Astral thinks he is. However, the police already found him, and Charlie finds himself completely surrounded by police forces again. Yuma and friends sneak past security, and head in to the train Charlie is in front of, and while Charlie's luck blasts the station with a thunderbolt, activating the train and knocking out the police forces with the impact and the electric charge, Charlie jumps into the train as well.
 Charlie laughs about escaping with his card, but behind him Yuma reports to his sister where they are, who instantly turns on her motorcycle.
 Yuma demands his card ("Number 11") back, but they agree they'll Duel for the cards, "Lucky Straight" and "Big Eye". They head to the top of the train, at which they start their duel. Kari, riding next to the train, wonders what Yuma is up to, and Tori tells him it's not a good idea as well.
 The train takes a sharp turn, and Charlie rehearses his catchphrase again, "Life is Carnival".
