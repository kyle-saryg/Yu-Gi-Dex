 His initial Deck is a  "Hell/Infernal"  Deck, consisting of powerful Fiend and DARK monsters, including " Chthonian " monsters. This Deck isn't seen at length but appears to have several control elements to it, "Chthonian Polymer" and "Chthonian Soldier" turning an opponent's powerful monsters against them, and "Mefist the Infernal General" and "Helpoemer" discarding cards from the opponent's hand.

 After becoming the top-ranked student at  North Academy  by defeating all fifty other students, including their top-ranked student  Czar , Chazz is gifted with the  " Armed Dragon " Deck  by North Academy's  Chancellor Foster  to use against Jaden Yuki in the "School Duel", an annual match between a nominated member of the student bodies of North Academy and  Duel Academy .
 Chancellor Foster forgets to take the "Armed Dragon" Deck back after Chazz opts to remain at Duel Academy (in the dub this line is changed to him bemoaning the fact that he didn't get a kiss from  Ms. Dorothy ). Despite this, Chazz keeps the cards and the issue is never brought up again.
 It is around this time in the original version that he debuts his nickname "Manjoume Thunder." The name is a pun in Japanese, but was considered untranslatable. The chant is simply changed to "Chazz it Up" in the dub.

 While Dueling against his brother  Slade Princeton  with the fate of Duel Academy on the line, Chazz is held down by a stipulation stating that he may only use monsters with less than 500 ATK. He journeys to a  well  deep in the forest and retrieves a myriad variety of cards thrown there by other students over the years who believed the cards too weak to ever be used.
 Chazz constructs a  0 ATK Deck  and develops several strategies that ultimately result in his victory.

 In the  Society of Light  arc, Chazz uses a mixed Deck of ' "Ojama"/"Armed Dragon"/"VWXYZ" . During his time in the  Society of Light , Chazz acquires the Beetron  Union Monsters . He ceases using this Deck late in his service to the Society and begins to use it again after being freed from  Sartorius ' influence by  Jaden Yuki . Some of the cards from his " Chthonian " Deck were featured in the  opening theme  and also  discarded  via  card effects .
 " Infernal White " and " White Veil " were given to Chazz by Sartorius and in his mind represented this servitude to the Society, so he ceased using them after his exodus from the group. He also begins calling himself "Manjoume White Thunder" in the Japanese version, signifying his devotion to Sartorius.

 During the height of Chazz's time in the  Society of Light , he is given a new Deck by Sartorius, focusing on a beatdown strategy with a  " White Knight "  theme.
 He defeats professional Duelist  Gelgo  during the  Genex Tournament  using this Deck. He later Duels Jaden Yuki, who uses Chazz's Ojama cards to break Sartorius' mind control. Using the card " Cemetery Change ", Chazz reclaims his Ojama monsters and also removes his white coat (calling himself "Manjoume Black Thunder" in the Japanese version). Despite this, he loses the Duel.
