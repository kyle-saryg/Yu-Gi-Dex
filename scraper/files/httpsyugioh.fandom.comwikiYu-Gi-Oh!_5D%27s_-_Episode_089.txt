 Featured Duel: Yusei Fudo vs. Lawton 
 Turn 1: Lawton 
 Lawton  draws " Skill Successor ". Lawton's hand contains " Explosive Wall ", "Narrow Tunnel", " Barrel Behind the Door ", "Secret Barrel", "Skill Successor", and " Gatling Ogre ". Lawton  Normal Summons  "Gatling Ogre" ( 3/800/800) in Attack Position. He then prepares to set five cards, so he can perform his  FTK  strategy, but  Yusei  sends " Effect Veiler " from his hand to the Graveyard in order to  negate  the effects of "Gatling Ogre" until the  End Phase . Lawton then sets five cards.
 Turn 2: Yusei 
 Yusei   draws  " Sonic Chick ". During the Standby Phase, the effect of " Speed World 2 " activates (Lawton's SPC: 0 → 1; Yusei's SPC: 0 → 1). Yusei's hand contains " Max Warrior ", "Desperate Tag", " Quickdraw Synchron ", and "Return Marker". Yusei then sends "Sonic Chick" from his hand to the Graveyard in order to  Special Summon  "Quickdraw Synchron" ( 5/700/1400) in Attack Position. When this monster is used for a Synchro Summon, he can treat its name as the name of any Synchron Tuner Monster. 
 Yusei intends to perform a Synchro Summon, so he can destroy "Gatling Ogre", however Lawton then  activates  his face-down " Narrow Tunnel ". Now both players can only summon one monster onto their side of the field once a turn and if they control more than one monster, they must destroy monsters they control until they control only one. Yusei then sets two cards.
 Turn 3: Lawton 
Lawton draws "Full Armor Ogre". During the Standby Phase, the effect of "Speed World 2" activates (Lawton's SPC: 1 → 2; Yusei's SPC: 1 → 2). Lawton then activates the effect of "Gatling Ogre" four times to  send  his four set cards ("Explosive Wall", "Barrel Behind the Door", " Secret Barrel " and "Skill Successor") to the  Graveyard  and inflict 3200 damage to Yusei (Yusei 4000 → 3200 → 2400 → 1600 → 800). Lawton then  Tributes  "Gatling Ogre" in order to  Tribute Summon  " Full Armor Ogre " ( 5/1600/1600) in Attack Position. 
 "Full Armor Ogre"  attacks  and destroys "Quickdraw Synchron". Yusei then activates his face-down " Desperate Tag " to reduce the  Battle Damage  he would take to 0 and  Special Summon  " Max Warrior " ( 4/1800/800) from his  hand  in Attack Position at the end of the Damage Step. Since "Full Armor Ogre" destroyed a monster by battle, its effect activates, inflicting 1000  damage  to Yusei, but Yusei activates his face-down " Return Marker " to negate the effect of "Full Armor Ogre" and inflict damage to Lawton equal to the ATK of "Full Armor Ogre" (Lawton 4000 → 2400).
 Turn 4: Yusei 
Yusei draws " Turret Warrior ". During the Standby Phase, the effect of "Speed World 2" activates (Lawton's SPC: 2 → 3; Yusei's SPC: 2 → 3). Yusei then Tributes "Max Warrior" in order to Special Summon "Turret Warrior" ( 5/1200/2000) in Attack Position. Due to the effect of "Turret Warrior", it gains  ATK  equal to the ATK of "Max Warrior" ("Turret Warrior": 1200 → 3000/2000). "Turret Warrior" attacks and destroys "Full Armor Ogre" (Lawton 2400 → 1000). Since "Full Armor Ogre" was sent from the field to the Graveyard, its final effect activates, allowing Lawton to revive "Gatling Ogre" ( 3/800/800) in Attack Position. 
 Lawton intends to draw either a Speed Spell or a Trap Card on his next Draw Phase. If it's a Speed Spell, Lawton can activate the effect of "Speed World 2" to remove four Speed Counters and inflict 800 damage to Yusei for each Speed Spell in his hand. If it's a Trap Card, he will set it and activate the effect of "Gatling Ogre" to send the set card to the Graveyard and inflict 800 damage to Yusei.

 Errors 
 In the dub, a shot of Lawton's opening hand shows the card " Barrel Behind the Door " with its unedited Japanese artwork. Interestingly, this is the second time this same error has been made with the same card in the space of only a few episodes, as a few episodes earlier the  Guard Robot  drew "Barrel Behind the Door", again featuring the unedited Japanese artwork, rather than the English artwork. 
 Differences in adaptations 
 In the dub, the bullets that " Gatling Ogre " fires are recolored purple and the sounds effects are laser-like. Oddly, the bullet fired by " Full Armor Ogre " remains unedited. 
 Extras 
 In the opening credits, there was another  10th Anniversary Movie  preview and then revealed a  corrupted  version of " Rainbow Dragon ".
