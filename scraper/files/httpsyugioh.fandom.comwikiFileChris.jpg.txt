 Biography 
 Ancient Atlantis 
       Chris in Ancient Atlantis.     
 Chris' parents are  Dartz  and  Iona , who were the king and queen of  Atlantis . Chris was the princess of Atlantis before the city sank beneath the ocean waves. A few years after the  Orichalcos  arrived, the people of Atlantis started turning into monsters, including Iona, who was then killed by Dartz. Believing people to be evil, Dartz made it his mission to wipe out the people of the city and the rest of the world. Dartz asked Ironheart and Chris to join him, but they both refused. In response he unleashed a number of  Orichalcos Soldiers  on them. When Dartz was taken over by the Orichalcos, she took shelter with her grandfather  Ironheart  in the  Realm of the Beasts .
 
       Chris during the battle of Atlantis.     
 Ironheart, Chris and Skye led a group of refugees from the city to the nearby mountains. Here Ironheart searched for the creatures of ancient power, the knights  Timaeus ,  Critias  and  Hermos . Together they fought in a battle against Dartz. However neither side was victorious.
 
 Present time 
 Chris' spirit along with Ironheart and Skye's continued to live on. They met  Yami Yugi , who was chosen to wield  Timaeus  in his card form " The Eye of Timaeus ". Ironheart and Chris saved him and  Téa Gardner  from the wreckage of a crashed train.
 Yami was unable to Summon Timaeus after he allowed  Yugi's  soul to be taken by playing " The Seal of Orichalcos ". Ironheart and Chris worked to help Yami overcome this. They took him to a plain of lost souls, where he faced Yugi in a Duel. Afterwards when Yugi was confronted by an  Orichalcos Soldier , Chris raced down on Skye's back to give him back the "Timaeus" card. However she is struck by one of Dartz's lightning bolts. She manages to hand Yami the card, before her spirit vanishes.
An image of her is later seen on a stone marker alongside her grandfather and her pet wolf.
 When the Pharaoh ultimately beats Dartz, Dartz was reunited with Chris in the spirit realm.
