 Examples 
 Rule Applies 
 Name Condition 
 The cards " Harpie Lady ", " Cyber Harpie Lady ", " Harpie Lady 1 ", " Harpie Lady 2 ", and " Harpie Lady 3 " each have a name condition stating that their name is also "Harpie Lady". Therefore you can only have a total of three of these cards in your Deck. For example:
 
 Three copies of "Harpie Lady", no copies of the others. 
 One copy of "Harpie Lady 1", one copy of "Harpie Lady 2", one copy of "Harpie Lady 3", no copies of either "Harpie Lady" or "Cyber Harpie Lady". 
 Two copies of "Harpie Lady 2", one copy of "Harpie Lady 3", no copies of either "Harpie Lady 1", "Harpie Lady", or "Cyber Harpie Lady". 
 " Harpie Queen ", on the other hand, only has its name treated as "Harpie Lady" while it is  face-up  on the field or in the Graveyard, but not in the Main Deck, so you can have three copies of "Harpie Queen" in addition to any legal combination of the above cards.
 The rule also applies to " A Legendary Ocean ". Its  condition  states its name is treated as " Umi " at all times, so you can only have three cards in total between these two.  You cannot have three copies of "A Legendary Ocean" and three copies of "Umi" in your deck.
 
 Name Condition between Main Deck and Extra Deck 
 Some cards that are stored in the  Extra Deck  have the same name as a card that exists in either the  Main Deck  or  Side Deck :
 
 " Neo-Spacian Marine Dolphin " is stored in the  Extra Deck , but by its condition its name is treated as " Neo-Spacian Aqua Dolphin " at all times. Therefore you cannot have more than three of a combination of these cards, despite them being stored in separate Decks. " Neo-Spacian Twinkle Moss " follows the same rule with " Neo-Spacian Glow Moss ". 
 Rule does not apply 
 Card Effect:  Changes card names 
 " Proto-Cyber Dragon " only has its name treated as " Cyber Dragon " while it is  face-up  on the field. It is not illegal to have more than three cards on the field with the same name; the rule only applies while the cards are in the Deck. Therefore, you can have three copies of "Cyber Dragon" and three copies of "Proto-Cyber Dragon" in your Main Deck.
 
 Retrains 
 Some cards are similar in name and stats and depict the same monster. For example:
 
 " Enraged Battle Ox " and " Battle Ox " 
 " Obnoxious Celtic Guard " and " Celtic Guardian " 
 " Swift Gaia the Fierce Knight " and " Gaia the Fierce Knight " 
 " Black Luster Soldier - Envoy of the Beginning " and " Black Luster Soldier " 
 In the above cases, a player may have up to three of each card above in their Deck. These cards are considered " Retrained " and are not treated as the same Monster Card.
 
 In Real World 
 Deck Construction 
 This rule must be followed even if the participants decide to ignore  Card limitations  set by yournament standards.
 
 In Trading 
 Due to this rule, Yu-Gi-Oh! cards are also generally traded in a bundle of 3, and thus being known as  Playset .  Preconstructed Sets  (usually  Structure Decks  and  Starter Decks ) are also sold/bought in a set of 3, in order to gain a  playset  of its contents.
