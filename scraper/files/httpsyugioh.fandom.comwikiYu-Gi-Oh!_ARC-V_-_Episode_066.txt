 " Crow's Crew ", known as " Opening Duel!! Crow vs Gongenzaka " in the Japanese version, is the sixty-sixth episode of the  Yu-Gi-Oh! ARC-V  anime. It first aired in Japan on July 26, 2015 and in Australia on October 18, 2016. It became available with official subtitles via Crunchyroll on January 17, 2017, and the dubbed version on Hulu in the US on January 2018. 
 The  Friendship Cup  finally begins with much fanfare in the  Duel Palace . The first match is between the " Blackwing " user,  Crow , against  Gong , using " Superheavy Samurais ". Against Gong who is confused with his first  Turbo Duel , Crow speeds with  Blackbird . Gong takes the first turn and goes all-out with his full power, trying his best to clear  Yuya 's negative reputation as the Duelist who lost to  Jack . On the other hand, Crow seems to be distracted by something among the audience, and could not focus on the Duel!

 Featured Duel: Crow Hogan vs. Gong Strong 
       Crow vs. Gong     
 At the start of the  Duel , the  Field Spell Card  " Crossover Acceleration " is  activated , as per the rules of an  Action Duel  and a  Turbo Duel . It will allow the players to use  Action Cards , but they may only have one in their  hand  at a time.
 Turn 1: Crow 
Since  Crow   controls  no cards, he  Special Summons  " Blackwing - Gust the Backblast " (900/1400) in  Attack Position  from his hand via its own  effect . As he controls a " Blackwing "  monster  other than " Blackwing - Oroshi the Squall " (400/600), Crow Special Summons it from his hand in Attack Position via its own effect. Crow  tunes  the  Level  2 "Gust" with the Level 1  Tuner monster  "Oroshi" to  Synchro Summon  " Assault Blackwing - Kuniyoshi the Fogbow " (1000/1000) in Attack Position. Crow activates the effect of "Kuniyoshi", letting him  send  a "Blackwing" monster from his hand to the  Graveyard  to inflict 300  damage  to  Gong . Crow sends " Jetstream the Blue Sky " (Gong: 4000 → 3700  LP ). Crow  Normal Summons  " Blackwing - Blizzard the Far North " (1300/0). As "Blizzard" was Normal Summoned, Crow activates its effect, which lets him Special Summon a Level 4 or lower "Blackwing" monster from his Graveyard in  Defense Position . He Special Summons "Jetstream" (100/800). Crow tunes the Level 1 "Jetstream" with the Level 2 "Blizzard" to Synchro Summon the Level 3 " Assault Blackwing - Kunisada the Fogbow " (1000/???) in Attack Position. Crow activates the effect of "Kunisada", letting him  return  a Level 3 or lower "Blackwing" monster from the Graveyard to his hand to increase the  ATK  of all "Blackwing"  Synchro Monsters  he controls by the value of its ATK until the end of Gong’s next  turn , but he cannot conduct his  Battle Phase  the turn that he activates this effect. He adds "Blizzard the Far North" ("Kuniyoshi": 1000 → 2300, "Kunisada": 1000 → 2300).
 Turn 2: Gong 
Gong Normal Summons " Superheavy Samurai Magnet " (900/1900). As "Magnet" was Normal Summoned, Gong activates its effect, allowing him to Special Summon a Level 4 or lower " Superheavy Samurai " monster from his hand. He Special Summons another copy of "Magnet" (900/1900) in Attack Position. The effect of "Magnet" prevents Crow from  attacking  any other monsters; since Gong controls two, Crow cannot attack.
 Turn 3: Crow 
Crow activates the effect of "Kuniyoshi", sending " Blackwing - Harmattan the Dust " (800/800) from his hand to the Graveyard to inflict 300 damage to Gong (Gong: 3700 → 3400 LP). Crow Normal Summons "Blizzard the Far North" (1300/0). He activates its effect to Special Summon "Harmattan the Dust" (800/800) from his Graveyard in Defense Position. Crow activates the effect of "Harmattan" since it was Normal or Special Summoned, increasing its  Level  by that of a "Blackwing" monster he controls. He targets "Kuniyoshi" ("Harmattan":   2 → 5). Crow tunes the now Level 5 "Harmattan" with the Level 2 Tuner monster "Blizzard" to Synchro Summon the Level 7 " Assault Blackwing - Raikiri the Rain Shower " (2600/2000) in Attack Position. Crow activates the effect of "Raikiri" to  destroy  cards Gong controls, up to the number of "Blackwing" monsters Crow controls. Both "Magnets" are destroyed. "Raikiri" attacks  directly , with Gong passing and refusing to take an Action Card (Gong: 3400 → 800 LP). Since Gong took damage from a direct attack and he has no  Spell / Trap Cards  in his Graveyard, he Special Summons " Superheavy Samurai Prepped Defense " (100/2100) from his hand in Defense Position via its own effect.
 
       Gong with " Superheavy Samurai Prepped Defense ", " Superheavy Samurai Trumpeter ", " Superheavy Samurai Flutist ".     
 Turn 4: Gong 
Gong draws " Superheavy Samurai General Coral ". Gong activates " Superheavy Samurai General Jade " (   1) and "General Coral" (   8) in his  Pendulum Zones . Gong  Pendulum Summons  " Superheavy Samurai Trumpeter " (300/600) and " Superheavy Samurai Flutist " (500/1000) from his hand, both in Attack Position. Gong activates the  Pendulum Effect  of "Jade", increasing the Level of a " Superheavy " monster he controls by 1. He targets "Trumpeter" for this effect ("Trumpeter":   2 → 3). Gong tunes the Level 3 "Flutist" and "Prepped Defense" with the now Level 3 Tuner monster "Trumpeter" to Synchro Summon " Superheavy Samurai Beast Kyubi " (1900/2500) in Defense Position. The effect of "Kyubi" increases its  DEF  by 900 for each Special Summoned monster Crow controls and it must also attack the monster that Crow controls with the highest ATK ("Kyubi": 2500 → 5200). "Kyubi" attacks and destroys "Raikiri" (Crow: 4000 → 1400 LP, "Kyubi": 5200 → 4300). Since a "Superheavy" monster Gong controls destroyed an opponent’s monster by battle, Gong activates the Pendulum Effect of "Coral", destroying it and allowing a "Superheavy" monster he controls to attack twice this turn. So Gong targets "Kyubi" to attack again this turn. "Kyubi" attacks, but Crow finds and activates the Action Card " Evasion ",  negating  the attack. During the End Phase, since it is the only card in Gong’s Pendulum Zone, "Jade" destroys itself with its own effect.
 Turn 5: Crow 
Crow draws and subsequently activates " Against the Wind ", allowing him to  add  a "Blackwing" monster from his Graveyard to his hand and take damage equal to its ATK. He adds "Blizzard the Far North" (Crow: 1400 → 100 LP). Crow Normal Summons "Blizzard the Far North" (1300/0) and activates its effect, Special Summoning "Jetstream the Blue Sky" (100/800) from his Graveyard in Defense Position. Crow tunes the Level 1 "Jetstream" with the Level 2 Tuner monster "Blizzard" to Synchro Summon " Assault Blackwing - Kunifusa the White Rainbow " (1000/???) in Attack Position ("Kyubi": 4300 → 5200). The effect of "Kunifusa" treats it as a  Tuner monster , as it was Synchro Summoned using a "Blackwing" monster as Synchro Material. Crow tunes the Level 3 "Kuniyoshi" and "Kunisada" with the Level 3 Tuner monster "Kunifusa" to Synchro Summon " Assault Blackwing - Kusanagi the Gathering Storm " (3000/???) in Attack Position ("Kyubi": 5200 → 3400). Since it was Synchro Summoned, the effect of "Kusanagi" increases its ATK by the total ATK of its "Blackwing"  Synchro Materials  until the End Phase ("Kusanagi": 3000 → 6000). "Kusanagi" attacks and destroys "Kyubi", with the effect of "Kusanagi" inflicting  piercing   battle damage  (Gong: 800 → 0 LP).
