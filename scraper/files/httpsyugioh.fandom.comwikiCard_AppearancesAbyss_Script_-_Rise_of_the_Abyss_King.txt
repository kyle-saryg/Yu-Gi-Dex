 Yu-Gi-Oh! ARC-V 
 In  episode 139 ,  Sylvio Sawatari  uses this card during the  Lancers' duel against   Z-ARC . He adds this card from his deck to his hand using " Abyss Actor - Superstar ", but " Supreme King Z-ARC 's" effect destroys it. Sylvio activates " Abyss Script - Abysstainment ", Tributing " Abyss Actor - Leading Lady " to set this card from his Graveyard on his field; he subsequently activates this card to destroy "Z-ARC" and " Supreme King Dragon Odd-Eyes ". Even though Z-ARC cannot activate cards in response to this card's effect, "Odd-Eyes'" own continuous effect prevents Z-ARC's Pendulum Monsters from being destroyed by card effects once per turn. Sylvio tries again, activating this card to destroy "Z-ARC" after using "Abysstainment" to Tribute " Abyss Actor - Wild Hope " and set this card. This time, "Z-ARC's" own continuous effect prevents it from being destroyed by its opponent's effects while Fusion, Synchro or Xyz Monsters are in their Graveyard or banished.
