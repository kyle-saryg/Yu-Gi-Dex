 Manga events 
 Previous events 
 Seto Kaiba  created this game for the first stage of  Death-T , which was designed to kill  Yugi Mutou . He hired three professional hitmen to face Yugi, including former green beret commander  Johnny Gayle , former swat team leader  Bob McGuire  and  an assassin, whose identity was unknown . The three of them were offered a bounty of ¥10,000, for each opponent they killed. A  KaibaCorp  employee hired  Anzu Mazaki  as the guide for the game, unaware that she was a friend of Yugi Mutou. [2] 
 Kaiba armed the hitmen with laser guns capable of shocking their opponents with one million volts, while Yugi was to be given toy guns, which had no effect on the sensors. [1] 
 When Yugi along with  Katsuya Jonouchi ,  Hiroto Honda  and  Johji  entered the Space Zone of Death-T, they met Anzu to their surprise who explained the rules of the game. They were all unaware that Kaiba had rigged it. [2] 
 
 The game 
 Yugi, Jonouchi and Honda went out to play the game. Honda who had some experience with guns took command and insisted that they wait for their opponents to make the first move. Jonouchi couldn't bear this kind of sneaky fighting and leaped up on one of the walls. He raced along the tops of more walls, until he found Gayle and kicked him in the face taking him out. [1] 
 While McGuire and "name unknown" shot at Jonouchi, Honda took advantage of them being distracted and shot McGuire dead on in his sensor, finding it had no effect. He was also skimmed on the shoulder pad by an enemy laser, which he noticed was more painful than it should be. Honda then pulled his teammates back for a time out. [1] 
 Honda explained that their guns were useless, while the mercenaries had been given deadly ones and cursed Kaiba. Johji, who is a fan of Kaiba didn't take that well and grabbed Anzu's gun to start firing at Honda, Jonouchi and Yugi. In his rage, he accidentally hit a spare vest in the sensor. Honda then realized that Anzu had been given the same type gun as the mercenaries. [1] 
 Honda turned down the voltage on Anzu's gun. Promising Johji a bath with Anzu in exchange for his assistance, Honda got Johji to hide on his back with Anzu's gun. Honda went back onto the battlefield and faked a surrender, which the mercenaries didn't accept. Johji tossed Honda the gun, which he quickly used to shoot out the two remaining mercenaries. Since the voltage was turned down, the shock didn't kill them. [1] 
 
 Aftermath 
 After the victory, Honda told Anzu of the promise he made with Johji and begs her to comply, but she refused. [1] 
 Yugi, Jonouchi, Honda, Johji and Anzu then proceeded to  Death T-2 .
