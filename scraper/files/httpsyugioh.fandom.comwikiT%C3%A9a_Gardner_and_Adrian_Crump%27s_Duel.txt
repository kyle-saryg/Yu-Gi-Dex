 Prior Events 
 Téa Gardner is stranded from the others and falls into a ravine. Unconscious, she has a dream where she and  Yugi Muto  are back in school. When Téa tells Yugi about the dream, Yugi tells her this is the dream but she will need " Dark Magician Girl " in order to survive the next trial. After the dream, Tea wakes up and notices a penguin throwing down a rope and she climbs out. She soon notices more penguins guiding her to a raft. This raft takes her to a palace in a frozen region. Inside she hears the voice of an elderly man and soon notices a penguin monster sitting on a table. The penguin monster tells her he is  Crump ,  KaibaCorp 's former accountant, who challenges her to a duel. Although she refuses, Crump forces her, and the duel proceeds.
 
 Téa Gardner vs Crump 
 Before the duel starts, Téa and Crump select their respective cards from the virtual card database and they each must select one monster as their Deck Master.
 Téa 's  Deck Master  is " Dark Magician Girl ".  Crump 's Deck Master is " Nightmare Penguin ".
 Turn 1: Téa 
Téa  draws  " Mirror Force " and subsequently  Sets  it. She then  Normal Summons  " Ancient Elf " (1450/1200) in  Attack Position .
 Turn 2: Crump 
 Crump  draws " Giant Red Seasnake " and subsequently Normal Summons it (1800/800) in Attack Position. His  Deck Master ability  increases the  ATK  of  WATER   monsters  by 200 (1800 → 2000). Crump  activates  " Cold Wave ", preventing both players from  activating  any  Magic  or  Trap Cards  until Crump's next  turn . "Giant Red Seasnake"  attacks  and  destroys  "Ancient Elf" (Téa 4000 → 3450).
 At this point, Crump explains that every time duelists lose life points, part of them becomes encased in ice.
 Turn 3: Téa 
Téa draws a monster and subsequently  Sets  it.
 Turn 4: Crump 
Crump draws " Mirror Wall ". He then Sets two cards.
 Turn 5: Téa 
Téa draws " Mystical Space Typhoon " and subsequently activates it to destroy Crump's Set "Mirror Wall". As one or more of his Trap Cards was destroyed by a card effect his opponent  controls , Crump activates his  face-down  " Driving Snow " to destroy Téa's set "Mirror Force". Téa's  hand  contains " Skelengel ", " Offerings to the Doomed ", " Pot of Greed ", and " Petit Angel ". Téa activates "Offerings to the Doomed" to destroy "Giant Red Seasnake" but preventing herself from conducting her  Draw Phase  next turn. 
 Téa  Flip Summons  " Fire Sorcerer " (1000/1500). The  Flip Effect  of "Fire Sorcerer" activates, letting Téa  remove  two cards in her  hand  from play [Notes 1]  and inflict 800  damage  to Crump (Crump 4000 → 3200). "Fire Sorcerer" attacks  directly  (Crump 3200 → 2200).
 Even though he was being encased in ice, Crump doesn't mind it. When Tea asks why he is obsessed with penguins, he tells his life story, and why he swore revenge against  Seto Kaiba .
 Turn 6: Crump 
Crump Normal Summons " Flying Penguin " (1200 → 1400/1000) in Attack Position. Crump then activates " Penguin Sword ",  equipping  it to "Flying Penguin" and increasing its ATK by 800 ("Flying Penguin": 1400 → 2200/1000). "Flying Penguin" attacks and destroys "Fire Sorcerer" (Téa 3450 → 2250).
 Téa has 2250  Life Points  remaining and controls no cards.
 Crump has 2200 Life Points remaining and controls "Flying Penguin" (2200/1000) in Attack Position and " Penguin Sword " (which is equipped to "Flying Penguin").
 Turn 7: Téa 
 Téa  skips her  Draw Phase  due to the  effect  of " Offerings to the Doomed ". She  Sets  a  monster .
 Turn 8: Crump 
Crump draws "Bolt Penguin" while his  hand  contains "Defender Iceberg" and "Penguin Torpedo". " Flying Penguin "  attacks  and  destroys  Téa's Set monster, " Skelengel " (900/400). The  Flip Effect  of "Skelengel"  activates , allowing Téa to  draw  a card (" Magic Formula ").
 Turn 9: Téa 
Téa draws " Maha Vailo " and subsequently Normal Summons it (1550/1400) in  Attack Position . She then activates " Magic Formula ",  equipping  it to "Maha Vailo" and increasing its ATK by 500 (1550 → 2050). Since "Maha Vailo" is equipped with an  Equip Magic Card , it gains 500 ATK due to its own effect (2050 → 2550). "Maha Vailo" attacks and destroys "Flying Penguin" (Crump 2200 → 1850).
 Turn 10: Crump 
Crump Normal Summons " Bolt Penguin " (1100/800) in  Defense Position  and Sets one card.
 Turn 11: Téa 
"Maha Vailo" attacks and destroys "Bolt Penguin". As a monster Crump  controls  was  destroyed by battle , he activates his  face-down  " Revenge Sacrifice " to  Tribute  "Maha Vailo" and Special Summon " Defender Iceberg " (0 → 200/2450) from his hand in Defense Position.
 Turn 12: Crump 
Crump Sets a card. He then Normal Summons " Penguin Torpedo " in (550 → 750/500) Attack Position. "Penguin Torpedo" attacks  directly  (Téa 2250 → 1500) via its own effect. Since "Penguin Torpedo" attacked directly through its own effect, its second effect destroys it at the end of the  Damage Step .
 Turn 13: Téa 
Téa draws " Michizure ", while her hand contains " Graceful Charity ". Téa moves her  Deck Master , " Dark Magician Girl ", to the field (2000/1700) in Attack Position.
 Turn 14: Crump 
Crump activates his face-down " Ocean of Regeneration " to revive "Penguin Torpedo" (550 → 750/500) in Attack Position, however "Penguin Torpedo" will be destroyed during the  End Phase  and Crump may not Normal Summon or Set a monster this turn. "Penguin Torpedo" attacks directly via its own effect (Téa 1500 → 750). "Penguin Torpedo" is destroyed at the end of the Damage Step due to its second effect. 
 Turn 15: Téa 
Téa activates her Deck Master Ability, letting her  reveal  a card from the top of her  Deck  for each monster in her Graveyard and then  add  one of them to her  hand . Her Graveyard contains four monsters - " Ancient Elf ", " Fire Sorcerer ", "Skelengel" and "Maha Vailo" and she reveals " Sage's Stone ", " Gemini Elf ", " Polymerization " and an unspecified fourth card. Téa adds "Sage's Stone" to her hand. She then activates "Sage's Stone", which is placed in one Monster Card Zone and treated as "Dark Magician" (2500/2100) in Attack Position (this is depicted as Yugi's " Dark Magician " coming out of his deck and being summoned to Téa's side of the field). "Dark Magician" attacks and destroys "Defender Iceberg". "Dark Magician Girl" then attacks directly (Crump 1850 → 0).

 Trivia 
 The losing conditions of this duel are similar to the "Sailor Moon" episode "Checkmate" or "For Friendship! Ami and Berthier Clash", where Ami and Berthier have a chess match and every time Ami loses a chess piece, a piece of her freezes. 
 Crump's assessment of Tea's Dueling prowess was dead on about her dueling a total of five times.
 Three duels with Joey off-screen. 
 Her duel with Joey in the beginning of  The Gauntlet is Thrown .
