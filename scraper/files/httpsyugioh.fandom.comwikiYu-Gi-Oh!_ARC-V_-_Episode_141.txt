 Yuya Sakaki vs. Sylvio Sawatari vs. Gong Strong vs. Moon Shadow 
         Yuya  vs  Sylvio  vs  Gong  vs  Moon .     
 This  Duel  is conducted as a  Battle Royal . 
At the start of the Duel, the  Field Spell Card  " Quartet of Quandry " is  activated , as per the rules of an  Action Duel . It will allow the players to use  Action Cards , but they may only have one in their  hand  at a time.
 Turn 1: Yuya 
Yuya  Normal Summons  " Performapal Hip Hippo " (800/800) and  Sets  two cards.
 Turn 2: Sylvio 
 Sylvio  Normal Summons " Abyss Actor - Curtain Raiser " (1100/1000). "Curtain Raiser" attacks "Hip Hippo", with Sylvio activating the effect of "Curtain Raiser" as he controls no other cards to double its ATK during  damage calculation . Yuya finds and  activates  the  Action Card  " Evasion ",  negating  the attack. Sylvio Sets a card.
 Turn 3: Gong 
 Gong  Normal Summons " Superheavy Samurai Flutist " (500/1000). As it was Normal Summoned this  turn , he activates its effect, letting him  Tribute  it to  Special Summon  a " Superheavy Samurai "  monster  from his  hand . He Tributes it to Special Summon " Superheavy Samurai Big Benkei " in  Defense Position  (1000/3500). "Big Benkei" may attack while it is in Defense Position, with its DEF being applied for damage calculation instead of its ATK. "Big Benkei" attacks "Hip Hippo", but Yuya activates his  face-down  " Hippo Carnival ",  Special Summoning  three " Hippo Tokens " (0/0 each) in  Defense Position . "Hippo Carnival" prevent other  monsters  Yuya controls from being attacked other than "Hippo Tokens". A  replay  occurs and "Big Benkei" attacks and  destroys  a "Hippo Token". 
 Turn 4: Moon Shadow 
 Moon Shadow  activates " Twilight Ninja Jogen " (   1) and " Twilight Ninja Kagen " (   10) in his Pendulum Zones. He Pendulum Summons " Twilight Ninja Shingetsu " (1500/100) and " Twilight Ninja Getsuga, the Shogun " (2000/3000), both in Attack Position. As he controls a " Ninja " monster, Moon Shadow activates the  Continuous Spell Card , " Illusion Ninjitsu Art of Hazy Shuriken ". Whenever a card is  added  to his hand, Moon Shadow may  send  that card to the  Graveyard  to inflict 300  damage  to his opponent. If he does not control a "Ninja" monster, "Hazy Shuriken" will  destroy  itself. "Shingetsu" attacks a "Hippo Token". Yuya finds the Action Card " Flame Ball ", but Moon Shadow takes it. He sends it to the Graveyard to activate the effect of "Hazy Shuriken", inflicting 300 damage to Yuya (Yuya: 4000 → 3700  LP ). Moon Shadow activates the effect of "Jogen", allowing him to let a "Ninja" monster he controls inflict  piercing   battle damage  this turn. He targets "Shingetsu". The attack continues and "Shingetsu" destroys the "Hippo Token". (Yuya: 3700 → 2200 LP). Moon Shadow activates the Pendulum effect of "Kagen", which allows it to copy the original Pendulum effect of a Pendulum monster in his other Pendulum Zone until the end of the turn. Via this effect, "Kagen" copies the Pendulum effect of "Jogen", allowing Moon Shadow to let "Getsuga" inflict piercing damage this turn. "Getsuga" attacks the last "Hippo Token", with Moon Shadow activating the other Pendulum effect of "Kagen", which increases the ATK of a "Ninja" monster by 500 until the end of the Battle Phase when it attacks ("Getsuga": 2000 → 2500 ATK).
 Duel continues in the next episode .

 Trivia 
 This episode is full of references to the show's early episodes as an intentional throwback.
 The introduction on the  Four Dimension Dragons  is reverted to the  Solid Vision  introduction to start the tonal shift back to  Dueltainment . 
 The standard Action Duel chant being recited at the start of the duel. 
 Yuya  using " Stargazer Magician " and " Timegazer Magician " to  Pendulum Summon  " Odd-Eyes Pendulum Dragon ", " Performapal Whip Snake ", and " Performapal Sword Fish " as he did in his first Pendulum Summon in  Episode 1 . 
 The field " Plain Plain " being used in the  You Show Duel School  as it was in Yuya's duel against  Zuzu  in  Episode 2 . 
 The  Battle Royale  using the " Quartet of Quandry " (though this was intentional on  Declan 's part to help people remember).
