 Appearance 
 Angela is a young woman of average height with green eyes. Her hair is of blonde color that reached to her waist on five sides with a pulled back one being in a braid. She even has three loose bangs, that are similar to  Mai 's, except that her blonde bangs are straight like lightning bolts while Mai's are loose and curly. She wears a blue necklace with three circles around her neck and wears a white blouse with a red jacket over it which is connected by a belt. She wears a blue skirt and wears yellowish high heel pumps.
 On formal occasions, she wears a red dress with a greenish-blueish necklace around her neck, a pair of gold bracelets on both of her wrists and red high heel pumps.
 In the dub, her cleavage was edited to make her less suggestive, and her clothes less revealing.
 
 Biography 
 Dark Signers 
 Angela unsuccessfully tries to interview  Yusei Fudo  after the  Fortune Cup  (in the dub, Angela incorrectly calls him "Fusei Yudo" which causes Carly to try to correct her). When  Goodwin  made an announcement pertaining to the Duel and Carly asked about Yusei's  mark , she becomes annoyed, thinking Carly was asking an off-topic question. After the announcement is over and the group talk about  Jack , she quickly leaves. [1] 
 With Carly held for questioning by  Sector Security  after Yusei and  Grady 's Duel, Angela posts an incendiary article about the Fortune Cup title Duel, referring to Yusei as the "alleged King" and theorizing that he cheated during the Duel, despite not having a single comment from him. [2] 
 During the event made to promote the premiering of  Atlas Rising  she publicly questions Goodwin about the fact that Jack is from  Satellite , just like Yusei, but Goodwin avoids the subject saying he cannot answer such uncertain information. [3] 
 Angela is seen reporting on the destruction of the city surrounding the  Arcadia Movement  building, after it was attacked by two " Earthbound Immortals ". [4] 
 Angela tries to report at the scene of an angry crowd demanding answers from Sector Security. The mob takes over her spot in front of the camera crew in order to shout at Goodwin. Goodwin phones her and requests that she calm down the crowd. Angela points how exceedingly difficult that is, but Goodwin reminds her he has done favors for her in similar situations and is counting on her. [5] 
 Sometime later, while the  Signers  war against the  Dark Signers  is raging on, Angela is seen reporting once again. As she states through the news that a Martial Law has been initiated on  the city , as a response to the unaccounted disappearance of City residents due to  Misty 's "Earthbound Immortal". Because of that law not a single citizen is seen on  New Domino 's main street. [6] 
 
       Angela gets sacrificed to Summon " Wiraqocha Rasca ".     
 She later reports that it has been several days since the geoglyphs incident, and there are still no comments from Sector Security about the subject.
 Angela is present during the Duel where Yusei, Jack and  Crow Hogan  face Rex Goodwin, covering the event intensely. She is the last of the reporters to be absorbed when Goodwin Summons " Earthbound Immortal Wiraqocha Rasca ". [7]  As with all people who get absorbed to Summon an "Earthbound Immortal", she was returned to normal upon Goodwin's downfall.
 
 Pre-World Racing Grand Prix 
 Angela informed the public about  Jack  being a suspect for the incidents caused by the  imposter Jack Atlas . [8] 
 
 World Racing Grand Prix 
 She informed the public of the havoc occurring in  the city  during the  World Racing Grand Prix , that the highway had been destroyed by  Duel Runners  crashing on it and that  Sector Security  has halted the tournament due to these events. [9] 
 Following a  falsification of history , she presented the news about the arrival of the famous  Team New World  at the airport. [10]
