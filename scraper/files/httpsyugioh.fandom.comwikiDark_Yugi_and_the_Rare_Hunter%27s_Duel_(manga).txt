 Prior events 
       Dark Yugi overhears a confrontation between  Jonouchi  and  the Rare Hunter .     
 When  Yugi Mutou  and  Katsuya Jonouchi  collected their  Duel Disks  at the  RPG Hobby Trading Cards  shop in advent of the  Battle City  tournament, the  card shop manager  noticed Jonouchi had a rare valuable card, " Red-Eyes Black Dragon ". He alerted the Rare Hunters, leading them to target Jonouchi that night. [1]  After  one of them  defeated Jonouchi in a Duel, he and his associates assaulted Jonouchi and took his "Red-Eyes" card. [2] 
 The next day, during the Battle City tournament,  Dark Yugi  overheard a confrontation between Jonouchi and the Rare Hunter, who had defeated him. Disgusted by people who steal others' sentimental cards, Dark Yugi challenged the Rare Hunter to a Duel, against the advice of Jonouchi. [2]  Jonouchi tried to warn Dark Yugi of the hunter's strategy, but Dark Yugi refused to accept an unfair advantage. [3] 
 
 The Duel 
 1st turn: Dark Yugi 
 Dark Yugi Summoned " Gazelle the King of Mythical Beasts " and  Set  " Polymerization ". [3] 
 2nd turn: Rare Hunter 
 
       The Rare Hunter opts for a defensive strategy.     
 The Rare Hunter's opening  hand  contained " Right Arm of the Forbidden One ", " Left Leg of the Forbidden One ", " Barrieroid Garman " and two others. [3] 
 The hunter  drew  " Graceful Charity " and  activated  it, drawing three cards and  discarding  two. His hand then contained "Right Arm of the Forbidden One", " Right Leg of the Forbidden One ", "Left Arm of the Forbidden One", "Barrierroid Garman". [3] 
 He Summoned " Stone Statue of the Aztecs " in  Defense Mode  and ended his turn. [3] 
 Dark Yugi suspected the Rare Hunter was a "turtle"-style player, whose defenses he would need to get through. The hunter was happy to have Dark Yugi focus on his monsters, while he gathered the cards that he needed. [3] 
 3rd turn: Dark Yugi 
 Dark Yugi Summoned " Baphomet " and activated his  face-down  "Polymerization",  fusing  "Baphomet" with "Gazelle" to Summon " Chimera the Flying Mythical Beast ". According to the  Super Expert Rules , monsters cannot attack the same turn they are fused, so he ended his turn. [3] 
 4th turn: Rare Hunter 
 
       The Rare Hunter uses specialized contact lens and inked  counterfeits  to tell what his cards are.     
 The Rare Hunter activated another "Graceful Charity", with "Right Arm of the Forbidden One" and " Exodia the Forbidden One " among the cards he drew. He cursed the repetition of the "Right Arm", but was relieved to be just one card short of completing " Exodia ". Using his specialized contact lenses on the specially inked  counterfeit  cards, he could see that the final piece, " Left Arm of the Forbidden One " was on top of his Deck. [3] 
 The hunter Summoned " Gear Golem the Moving Fortress " in Defense Mode and ended his turn. [3] 
 5th turn: Dark Yugi 
 Dark Yugi grew suspicious of the hunter's hand exchanges and disinterest in attacking and deduced that he must be planning on winning with "Exodia". He called the hunter out on his plan and vowed to crush "Exodia" with the card in his hand. [3] 
 Dark Yugi worried about playing " Chain Destruction " this turn, as it would prevent him from Summoning another monster, but fearing the Rare Hunter had already gathered most of the pieces of "Exodia", decided to go for and played it. [4] 
 Dark Yugi attacked "Stone Statue of the Aztecs" with "Chimera",  destroying  it. [4] 
 He then Set " Lightforce Sword " and ended his turn. [4] 
 
         Dark Yugi incapacitates " Exodia " by destroying all copies of a single component.     
 6th turn: Rare Hunter 
 As the Rare Hunter was about to draw his card, Dark Yugi activated "Lightforce Sword", forcing one card from the hunter's hand, "Right Arm of the Forbidden One" onto the field. He then activated "Chain Destruction" to destroy it and all further copies in the Hunter's hand and  Deck . [4] 
 With no copies of the "Right Arm" left, the Rare Hunter was left unable to gather a complete set of the five pieces. Without "Exodia", Dark Yugi declared that the hunter had no way to win. The hunter admitted he had lost, but was shocked that his Deck could be defeated. [4] 
 
 Aftermath 
 Using the  Millennium Rod ,  Marik Ishtar  took control of the Rare Hunter, in order to speak with Dark Yugi. [5] 
 Per the  ante rule , Dark Yugi received the "Red-Eyes Black Dragon". He tried to return it to Jonouchi, but Jonouchi refused to accept it until he had grown as a fighter. [5]
