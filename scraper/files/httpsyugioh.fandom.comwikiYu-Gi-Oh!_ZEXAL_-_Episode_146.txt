 Summary 
       Yuma  and  Astral  discuss their future.     
 Yuma  sits on the roof of  his house ,  Astral  floating beside him. Yuma tells Astral that it doesn't matter what world he is in or what his opponent says, he can always  Duel  them and make a new friend. He says this enables him to understand them and when that happens, his heart beats faster (in the dub, Yuma says he's glad he got into Dueling; he can simply forget about his problems and have fun. He also makes Astral promise not to tell  Kari  or  Haru ). Yuma asks Astral what will happen when they finally obtain all the " Numbers ". Astral responds that he'll complete his mission and return to the  Astral World . Yuma asks "and then what?" Astral responds that he never really thought about that. Yuma urges him to do so, hopping up and saying he's been thinking about their future - he believes it will be a bright one (in the dub, Yuma tells Astral that in the future, Astral will be free to do as he pleases). He vows to show Astral his future some day, but wonders if Astral will be around when the time comes. Astral tells him that's a good idea. Yuma calls him a jerk, thinking that he'd be lonely (in the dub, Yuma accuses Astral for predicting that he (Yuma) would break down and cry once Astral leaves). He tells Astral that when the time comes, he'll Duel him with everything he's got. He'll win and then laugh about it afterwards. This is his promise to Astral.
 
       " Number 39: Utopia Roots " prepares to strike.     
 In the present, Yuma is blasted backwards after Astral's  attack , now recalling the promise he made.  Tori  comments that Yuma has only 300  Life Points  left, while  Bronk  points out that his  field  is even worse news (in the dub, Bronk makes Tori's comment), with  Anna  adding that he has no  monsters .  Nistro  says Astral still has " Number 39: Utopia Roots " though, with  Dextra  adding that it still has two  Overlay Units  as well (in the dub, Nistro comments that Yuma is in a tight spot; Dextra adds that "tight" does not even describe the situation Yuma is in now).  Trey  reminds his brothers that with " Overlay Accel ", Astral can attack again.  Quattro  says Yuma will lose if the next attack hits (in the dub, Trey encourages Yuma to fight because he has gotten out of situations tighter than this, while Quattro grimly notes that when it's over, it's over). Yuma is back on his feet and remembers he promised Astral that he would show him his future a long time ago and had forgotten, but Astral remembered it. Astral  activates  the  effect  of "Overlay Accel" now,  detaching  an Overlay Unit from "Utopia Roots" to let it attack again. A spectral form of " Number 62: Galaxy-Eyes Prime Photon Dragon " appears behind his monster. Yuma thinks that he told Astral that he would laugh during their Duel, but he isn't laughing now. Astral orders a  direct attack . "Utopia Roots" points at Yuma with its sword, while the spectral "Prime Photon Dragon" roars. Yuma thinks to himself that Dueling is the best, most heart-pounding, most fun thing in the world, yet he's been crying quite a lot because of it. He wonders if what he lost is the ability to laugh from the bottom of his heart - is that what Astral wants to remind him of?
 
       Yuma's  Shining Draw .     
 Yuma activates his  face-down  " Danger Draw ", explaining that when Astral attacks using a monster that has more  ATK  than Yuma's Life Points, he can  draw a card . If it's a  Trap Card , he can  negate  the attack and activate that card immediately. Yuma tells Astral he remembers the promise he made now and thanks him for reminding him. Yuma wonders why Astral had to remind him in such a serious and awkward way, though. Astral mutters Yuma's name, but Yuma says he remembers the promise and that he'll beat Astral now and laugh from the bottom of his heart. He vows to show Astral his future right now and raises his fist, light shining out from it. Everyone gasps and Tori says this can't be, but Yuma chants "In a Duel between the strongest Duelists, everything is inevitable. A Duelist can create the very cards they draw!  Shining Draw !" ("A truly powerful Duelist can change the outcome of a Duel. He can even generate the very cards he needs to draw! Go, Shining Draw!" in the dub) Astral muses that this confirms what he had believed as he recalls his battle with  Don Thousand  - Yuma is a piece of Astral that he lost during that battle - his other self (Astral remembering his battle with Thousand is cut from the dub; instead, Astral is surprised that Yuma can perform the Shining Draw). Yuma announces that he's drawn a Trap Card, so the  battle  is canceled. The spectral "Prime Photon Dragon" vanishes and Yuma activates " Halfway to Forever ". This lets him  overlay  the " Gagaga Cowboy " and " Gagaga Samurai " in his  Graveyard . He  chants  "Pegasus, be unleashed here and now, and run free as the wind into the future. This is my creation of Heaven and Earth. My Future,  kattobingu " ("Forge the path of destiny!" in the dub).
 
         " Number F0: Utopic Future " attacks.     
 He  Xyz Summons  " Future Number 0: Utopic Future " in  Attack Position . Trey is shocked to see a  Rank   zero  monster, while Bronk calls it the King of the Future (in the dub, Trey is surprised to see that Yuma Summoned his own "Number", while Bronk repeats, "Utopic Future"). Tori points out that it looks sort of like Yuma. Astral says it truly is his future. Yuma tells them his future is something that has yet to be decided - like the possibilities that a Rank 0 monster could have. Astral calls it a fitting "Number" for him (in the dub, Astral is impressed, while Yuma admits he learned from the best and Astral beckons Yuma to show him what he had learned). Yuma agrees and vows to enjoy this final Duel until the very last second. Astral urges him to come at him then and ends his  turn . Yuma draws and orders "Utopic Future" to attack "Utopia Roots". Astral asks why he'd attack when his monster has 0 ATK and wonders what Yuma is planning. He asks if it's another bluff, but activates the effect of "Utopia Roots". When it battles an Xyz Monster, he can  attach  one of the Overlay Units from "Utopia Roots" to the other Xyz Monster and change the ATK of "Utopia Roots" to the number of Overlay Units the other monster has more of times 100 (in the dub, Astral says he'll spare Yuma the equations, since Yuma does not comprehend it). "Utopia Roots" bats its Overlay Unit at "Utopic Future" and because the former now has no Units and the latter has three, the ATK of "Utopia Roots" falls to 300 - the same value as Yuma's Life Points.
 Yuma activates the effect of "Utopic Future", revealing that it cannot be  destroyed by battle  and he will take no  battle damage  from battles involving it. After the battle, he can take  control  of the opponent's monster. "Utopic Future" flaps its wings, pelting "Utopia Roots" with feathers. Astral yells, "What!?", but Yuma declares " Rising Sun Future Slash ". "Utopia Roots" vanishes from Astral's field and reappears on Yuma's. Yuma orders a direct attack with "Utopia Roots", reducing Astral to 550 Life Points. Astral says he hasn't won yet, while Yuma  Sets  a card an ends his turn, thus returning "Utopia Roots" to Astral's control and its ATK rising back to 2000.
 
         The " Numbers " lead to hope.     
 Astral says the attack wasn't a bluff, then. Yuma says he's right and adds that he managed to lower the ATK of "Utopia Roots" (in the dub, Astral says Yuma's intense love for Dueling made him a fearsome foe; Yuma replies that now he has his groove back, there's nothing Astral can do to stop him). Astral muses that if Yuma could find new possibilities and a new future, it couldn't be a bluff (in the dub, Astral reminds Yuma that he learned everything from a master Duelist). Yuma tells him that this Duel is super intense and urges Astral to come at him with everything he has. Nistro remarks that this is turning out to be a great Duel, with Dextra agreeing. Anna says neither is budging an inch, but Tori comments that they're both enjoying themselves too (the comments of Yuma's friends are cut from the dub). Astral's hand begins to glow and he says that if Rank 0 is the representation of infinite possibilities, then he'll have to keep climbing higher and higher in response. He chants "the light...the power of everything! They dwell in my right hand, leading the way to hope! To dreams! Shining Draw!" ("A master Duelist can create his own destiny and will his exact card into existence! Go, Cosmic Shining Draw!" in the dub). Astral says it has come and activates " Hyper-Rank-Up-Magic Ultimate Force ". He explains that this lets him  Rank-Up  a " Utopic " monster into a Rank 10 monster, then attach "Hyper Ultimate Force" to it as an Overlay Unit. He declares " Hyper Xyz Evolution !". He chants "the memories of my soul were scattered! Now, become a single star, they become the resounding thunder that is the will of God! This is the apex and the end of the Numbers" ("Witness the pinnacle of prominence!" in the dub). Both base "Numbers" and various " Number C " forms are seen as Astral chants, until it finally ends at the six forms of "Utopia".
 
         The storm generated by " Number 99: Utopic Dragon ".     
 Astral Xyz Summons " Number 99: Utopic Dragon " in Attack Position. Yuma is shocked to see this "Number". Astral activates its effect, which lets him Special Summon a "Number" from his Graveyard with its effects negated. "Utopic Dragon" breathes fire into the air and from the resulting explosion emerges " Number 39: Utopia Beyond ". Yuma says he still has the effects of "Utopic Future" and Astral asks if he's really sure. He orders "Utopic Dragon" to attack, but Yuma activates the effect of "Utopic Future", so he takes no battle damage, neither monster is destroyed and he'll take control of "Utopic Dragon". "Utopic Future" flaps its wings, but Astral declares that he won't let that happen and activates the effect of "Utopic Dragon",  detaching  an Overlay Unit when "Utopic Dragon" would  leave  his side of the field for any reason. It will negate that effect and destroy all monsters besides "Utopic Dragon". A storm brews overhead via the effect, even hitting the spectators. As the storm hits Yuma, he responds that he won't let that happen either and activates the other effect of "Utopic Future" - he can detach an Overlay Unit to prevent its destruction. A lightning bolt rebounds off of "Utopic Future", but Astral claims he wasn't aiming for that - he wanted to destroy "Utopia Beyond". A bolt promptly does so and Astral reveals that the destroyed monster's ATK shall be dealt to Yuma as  damage .
 Trey says it had 3000 ATK and wonders if it's over. "Utopic Dragon" fires a blast at Yuma and his Life Points fall to 0. Tori screams "NO!" (in the dub she yells Yuma's name), but Yuma hits the ground and raises his arm, activating the effect of "Utopic Future", detaching an Overlay Unit to reduce the damage to 0. "Utopic Future" fires a blast from its sword at Yuma and his Life Points return to 300. Astral ends his turn. Astral urges Yuma not to lose here (in the dub, Astral praises Yuma for surviving the attack). Yuma gets to his feet, laughing. He says there's no way he'd let this Duel end like that. Nistro remarks that he envies them, with Dextra agreeing, saying she's enjoyed watching this from the bottom of her heart.  Quinton  says talking isn't really needed here. Trey agrees, musing that their hearts are in sync, so they can "talk that way". Quinton is an awe of the Duel, while Anna compares Yuma and Astral to two peas in a pod. Bronk agrees and  Cathy  adds that the two are shining like the cat's meows (these comments are removed in the dub).
 Yuma thinks this will be his last turn. He does several back flips, landing each of them. Running forward, he draws and yells "kattobingu". He urges Astral to take everything he has, with Astral telling him to come at him. Yuma orders "Utopic Future" to attack "Utopic Dragon", aiming to take control of it again. Astral says it's useless and activates the effect of "Utopic Dragon", detaching an Overlay Unit to destroy "Utopic Future". Yuma counters with the effect of "Utopic Future", detaching an Overlay Unit to prevent its destruction. He then claims that this is where the Duel will be decided. He activates his face-down " Hi-Five the Sky ", which will let him negate the effect of an Xyz Monster that has battled and allow it to attack again. Bronk yells "NO WAY!", with Yuma declaring he's negating the effect of "Utopic Future". Cathy points out that it can be destroyed by battle now. Yuma activates another Trap Card - " Memories of Courage ".
 
         " Memories of Courage " powers up "Utopic Future" using the " Numbers " in the  Graveyard .     
 When two "Numbers" battle, the ATK of his monster increases by the total number of "Number" monsters in their Graveyards times 500. There are eight: " Shark Drake ", "Prime Photon Dragon", " Utopia ", " Utopia Ray ", " Utopia Ray V , " Utopia Ray Victory ", "Utopia Roots" and "Utopia Beyond". The spirit of each appears alongside "Utopic Future", increasing its ATK to 4000. Tori is pleased to see all the "Utopia" monsters alongside  Shark  and  Kite 's "Numbers". Anna points out that the two monsters have the same ATK now, with  Nelson  wondering if Yuma plans to destroy them both. (Tori, Anna and Nelson's comments are removed from the dub.) As the spirits vanish and "Utopic Future" charges, Yuma reveals that "Memories of Courage" has another effect - his monster can't be destroyed by battle and if he destroys the opponent's monster and inflicts no damage, he can attack again. "Utopic Future" flies around "Utopic Dragon", slashing as the dragon counters with bites. Eventually, a hit lands and "Utopic Dragon" is destroyed. Yuma believes the next attack will decide everything. He orders a direct attack, but Astral claims it's not over yet. He activates his face-down " The Door of Destiny ". Light flashes and Yuma finds  the Door  standing before Astral with 0 ATK.
 
         The Door  appears via the effect of " The Door of Destiny ".     
 Astral explains that this card negates a direct attack and then Special Summons itself. During his next turn, he can  banish  "Number" monsters from his Graveyard to inflict 500 damage to Yuma for each one banished. He adds that this means Yuma will lose if he does not destroy the Door right now. Yuma muses that the Door is where he first met Astral - everything began right here. He recalls his meeting with it, with the Door saying "whomever opens this door shall receive a new power...but the price is that the one who does so will give up that which is most important to them" ("Whoever can open this door will gain a great new power, but know that such a reward comes great risk. You would lose that which is most valuable to you," in the dub). Yuma says he understands now - the most important thing to him is Astral. Astral urges him not to be afraid. He tells Yuma there is one card left in his hand - and that card can cut through the chains to the future. He tells Yuma not to be afraid of the future. Yuma wonders why Astral would try to give him courage now. Astral goes on to claim Yuma was still a hundred years too early to challenge him (in the dub, Yuma says he cannot do it because if he does, he would lose Astral forever; Astral reminds him that he cannot be gone if he will be in Yuma's heart).
 
         Yuma activates " Double or Nothing! ".     
 Yuma mutters Astral's name and activates " Double or Nothing! ". As an attack was negated, that monster's attack is doubled and it can attack again. Yuma orders the "final attack", with Astral urging him on with "kattobingu". Yuma becomes a beam of light and he merges with his monster. The  Emperor's Key  appears on the chest of "Utopic Future" and Yuma declares he's coming now and that he'll never forget their fighting together, laughing together and crying together. Astral was always by his side - but now he must "kattobingu" himself. He claims he'll cut open this door to the future and declares "Rising Sun Future Slash". The chains binding the door shatter first, then the Door itself explodes. Astral's Life Points fall to 0 and he hits the ground, hard. Everyone simply stares in awe.
 
         The  Numeron Code  is completed.     
 Astral pushes himself to his knees and finds Yuma offering him a hand up. Astral accepts it and actually stands on the ground instead of floating. Astral tells Yuma he Dueled magnificently. Blue light shines above them and the Numeron Code floats there. Astral says it's time for them to go their separate ways, then. Yuma tells him to go and swears not to cry, smiling. Astral tells him he always loved seeing Yuma smile, adding that he'll never forget that smile. As he floats towards the Code, Astral claims he'll "kattobingu" now. Yuma tells him to do just that. He reminds him to never to give up and challenge every hardship. Tori mutters "thank you, Astral" (in the dub, she says she'll miss him), while Yuma lowers his head, tears in his eyes. He says he'll never forget Astral, with Astral responding in kind (In the dub, they declare their friendship until the end of time). Astral touches the Code and the card stops changing form, finally connecting its parts into a completed card. Tears stream from Yuma's eyes and he cries out Astral's name twice (In the dub, Yuma also says goodbye, and Astral makes his final observation: "Even galaxies apart, friendship is forever.")
 
         Yuma returns to his former life.     
 Another day, Yuma is running to  school , saying he's very late again. Bronk passes him on his skateboard, taunting that he'll see Yuma later. Yuma asks him to wait and pops some Duel rice into his mouth (in the dub, Bronk advises Yuma to lighten his load to go faster, while Yuma reminds him of a bet they made earlier: the loser has to do whatever the winner says). Yuma narrates that his battles have finally ended and his life has returned to how it used to be - or close to it (Yuma's narration is edited out from the dub). When he reaches school, Yuma flops down on the ground after descending a flight of stairs. Standing before him is  Rio , who brandishes a  Misconduct Card  and tells him that since he's late, he'll have to clean toilets for a week as punishment (in the dub, she said he had to dress like " Rainbow Kuriboh "; Bronk let her decide Yuma's punishment, since the former won the race). On her arm is the band of the Student Council President. Behind her stand Cathy and Trey and behind them, Anna,  Alito ,  Girag  (with  Ponta  on his shoulder), Tori,  Summer ,  Jen ,  Spencer ,  the former Student Council President ,  Lotus Hanazoe ,  Yata-Garasu ,  Mizar ,  Dumon  and  Art Stanley . All are dressed in school uniforms. Yuma calls Rio "Shark's sister" and wonders if that punishment isn't a bit harsh (in the dub, Yuma argues that since Astral used the Numeron Code to revive Rio and the other Barian Emperors as humans, she should lighten the punishment a bit). Rio responds that she's decided it's two weeks now (in the dub, she threatens to make him dress like " Gagaga Girl "). Yuma explains that Astral used the Numeron Code, returning the  Seven Barian Emperors  to Earth. On a nearby walkway, Shark muses that Yuma is the same idiot as always ("the best dweeb a friend could ask for" in the dub). Yuma continues, saying that his  his dad  returned from the Astral World, with his  mom  beside him (Yuma doesn't say anything in the dub). The two seem to be off on a new adventure (in the dub, Kazuma tells Mira that Astral knows how thankful they are to him, with Mira agreeing). Meanwhile, Quattro has returned to the professional circuit, winning a duel and Yuma explains that Kite and  Orbital 7  returned as well. They're working with  Dr. Faker ,  Hart , Quinton and  Vetrix , continuing their research on parallel dimensions. Kite orders Orbital to analyze the new data immediately. Orbital says "understood" and is echoed by  Lillybot  and  two smaller robots . Yuma remarks that things have returned to normal (scenes taken from the various opening and ending themes are played over this portion of his narration, but with Astral edited out and cards flipped to show the backs).
 
         Eliphas  and  Enna  witness the new threat.     
 Besides Astral being gone, everything is the same. That evening, he and Tori sit in the grass, silent. The Emperor's Key begins to glow and Shark calls out to him. Yuma turns and sees all of the Barian Emperors besides  Vector , Kite, Orbital and the entire  Vetrix Family . Yuma asks what's happened and Shark asks if Yuma is going to mope around forever - they have to go now (in the dub, Yuma wonders how the Barian Emperors, the Arclights, and the Tenjos became best friends, while Shark apologizes to Yuma for interrupting his "date"; there's trouble ahead). Kite explains that a new threat is approaching the Astral World. On the balcony of the  Astral Tower ,  Eliphas  stands with  Enna . Enna points out the storm before them, saying that the power of  Chaos  is gathering. Eliphas remarks that with the power of the Numeron Code, the Astral and  Barian Worlds  were merged back together, but this resulted in Chaos returning. Enna states a new battle has begun now and Eliphas turns around, asking Astral if he'll go. Astral simply says "yes" (in the dub, neither Eliphas nor Enna mention the power of Chaos; Astral still agrees to fight, but he won't do it alone). Back on Earth, Yuma flies through the sky, holding Tori's hand as the others gather around them (during this scene, the first opening theme,  Masterpiece  plays in the background in the original Japanese; in the English dub,  Take a Chance   starts playing). Tori asks him to wait, but the others pay her no mind. Shark says they all owe Yuma and Astral a huge debt and Rio adds they should pay them back by helping. Kite asks if they're all ready for the journey to another world. Orbital responds that they'll all "kattobingu" (in the dub, Kite threatens to trade Orbital in if his boosters fail; Orbital happily agrees). Quinton says it's either now or never, with Quattro saying he'll show everyone his "fanservice" and Trey saying he'll fight by Yuma's side no matter what. Vetrix adds that they'll unleash the power of their familial bonds (in the dub, Quinton asks Quattro if he brought on his full "A-game" with him, with Quattro replying he only has an A-game telling Quinton to get real; Trey asks Vetrix if they have what it takes to win; Vetrix reminds his sons they have much to learn about their full potential). Dumon explains that the power of the Seven Emperors has revived and this time they'll use it to help Astral (in the dub, Dumon says to expect the unexpected in this battle). Mizar claims he'll let their foes taste the Duel of the true dragon tamer. Alito agrees, saying he's getting fired up, with Girag adding he'll knock some heads together for the first time in a long time (Alito says he'll KO the competition and Girag is excited for a really good brawl in the dub).
 
         Astral heads to rejoin Yuma and face  Chaos .     
 Yuma is happy his friends are with him. "Jyan, jyan, jyan" rings out behind them and suddenly Vector is floating among them. He says he figured he'd lend them a hand, with the best of intentions (in the dub, Vector asks Yuma if he's so sure about doing this; he can't do it without him). Rio says it's been a while since they've seen him. Vector agrees, but claims he couldn't let them have all the fun. Yuma is ecstatic that everyone is together. (In the dub, Rio says Vector better not double, triple, or quadruple-cross them. Vector claims that's "not the Ray Way". Yuma says that the Ray Way involves guard dogs and thorn bushes.) As Astral flies from the Astral Tower, he muses that everyone has a good side and a bad side, which are always at war with each other. He believes that as long as they don't run away and learn to understand each other, everything will turn out alright (in the dub, Astral believes that while he is uncertain about the future, if the past is his guide to tomorrow, he is not afraid of the unknown, thanks to the friendships he made). The group flies towards a hole ripped in the sky and Astral says he'll keep fighting until everyone understands each other. Tori blushes and tells Yuma she loves to see him smile (in the dub, Tori says she's "Gagaga" for him). Yuma turns bright red, but Tori clasps his hand harder and asks if he'll get his most important thing back (in the dub, Tori asks if Yuma is ready to help Astral). Astral reaches the cloud formation, which is now shaped like a giant hand and crackling with electricity, shouting, "This is how I kattobingu!" ("I'm ready to high five the sky!" in the dub). Yuma tells Astral to wait for him, instructing everyone to move out as they all shout "Kattobingu!" (In the dub, Yuma says Astral never has to be scared nor feel alone, as they all shout that they're feeling the flow, with Yuma saying the last word alone.)
 
 Featured Duels 
 Yuma Tsukumo vs. Astral 
 Duel continues from  the previous episode . 
 
         " Halfway to Forever " lets Yuma  overlay   Xyz Monsters  from the  Graveyard .     
 Turn 6: Astral 
 Astral   activates  the  effect  of " Overlay Accel " to  detach  " Number 62: Galaxy-Eyes Prime Photon Dragon " from " Number 39: Utopia Roots " ("Utopia Roots": 2 → 1 ORU) and allow it to  attack  again. "Utopia Roots" attacks directly. As an opponent's  monster  that has more  ATK  than  Yuma  has  Life Points  is attacking directly, Yuma activates his  face-down  " Danger Draw " to  draw a card  and  reveal  it. If it is a  Trap Card , he can  negate  the attack and activate the Trap Card from his  hand . Yuma performs a  Shining Draw  and gets the Trap Card, " Halfway to Forever ", so the attack is negated.
 
         " Number F0: Utopic Future " is Summoned.     
 Yuma activates "Halfway to Forever" to overlay " Gagaga Cowboy " and " Gagaga Samurai " from the Graveyard (as they were both destroyed in battle this turn) in order to Xyz Summon " Future Number 0: Utopic Future " ( 0/0/0, ORU: 2) in  Attack Position .
 Turn 7: Yuma 
Yuma draws "Memories of Courage". "Utopic Future" attacks "Utopia Roots". Astral activates the effect of "Utopia Roots" to detach "Utopia" ("Utopia Roots": 1 → 0 ORU),  attach  it to "Utopic Future" ("Utopic Future": 2 → 3 ORU), and make the ATK of "Utopia Roots" equal to the difference in  Ranks  between it and "Utopic Future" multiplied by the number of Overlay Units attached to "Utopic Future" ("Utopia Roots": 2000 → 300 ATK). Due to the first effect of "Utopic Future", it can't be destroyed by battle and Yuma takes no battle damage. At the end of the Damage Step, Yuma activates the second effect of "Utopic Future" to take  control  of "Utopia Roots". "Utopia Roots" attacks directly (Astral: 850 → 550 LP). At the end of the Battle Phase, control of "Utopia Roots" returns to Astral. Yuma  Sets  a card. On Yuma's End Phase, the effect of "Utopia Roots" expires ("Utopia Roots": 300 → 2000 ATK).
 
         " Number 99: Utopic Dragon " emerges.     
 Turn 8: Astral 
Astral performs a Cosmic Shining Draw and gets " Hyper-Rank-Up-Magic Ultimate Force ". Astral then activates "Hyper-Rank-Up-Magic Ultimate Force" to  Rank-Up  "Utopia Roots" (a "Utopic" Xyz Monster) via  Hyper Xyz Evolution  in order to Xyz Summon " Number 99: Utopic Dragon " ( 10/4000/2000, ORU: 1) in Attack Position. The second effect of "Hyper-Rank-Up-Magic Ultimate Force" also attaches itself to the Summoned monster as an Overlay Unit ("Utopic Dragon": 1 → 2 ORU). Astral activates the second effect of "Utopic Dragon" to revive " Number 39: Utopia Beyond " ( 6/3000/2500) in Attack Position with its effects negated (as it's a "Number" monster). 
 "Utopic Dragon" attacks "Utopic Future", but it's not destroyed and Yuma takes no damage. Yuma activates the second effect of "Utopic Future" to take control of "Utopic Dragon", but Astral activates the final effect of "Utopic Dragon" (as a card effect was activated that would make "Utopic Dragon" leave Astral's side of the field) to detach an Overlay Unit ("Utopic Dragon": 2 → 1 ORU), negate the effect of "Utopic Future", and destroy all other monsters on the field. Yuma activates the third effect of "Utopic Future" to detach an Overlay Unit ("Utopic Future": 3 → 2 ORU) and prevent it from being destroyed by card effects. Therefore, only "Utopia Beyond" is destroyed. The effect of "Utopic Dragon" would also inflict damage to Yuma equal to the combined ATK of the destroyed monsters, but Yuma activates the fourth effect of "Utopic Future" to detach an Overlay Unit ("Utopic Future": 2 → 1 ORU) and take no effect damage (for dramatic effect, Yuma's Life Points are shown dropping from 300 to 0 from the damage and then recovering back to 300 after the effect of "Utopic Future" activates).
 Turn 9: Yuma 
Yuma draws " Double or Nothing! ". "Utopic Future" attacks "Utopic Dragon", but the former is not destroyed and Yuma takes no battle damage. Yuma activates the second effect of "Utopic Future" to take control of "Utopic Dragon", but Astral activates the final effect of "Utopic Dragon" ("Utopic Dragon": 1 → 0 ORU) to negate the effect of "Utopic Future" and destroy all other monsters on the field. Yuma activates the third effect of "Utopic Future" ("Utopic Future": 1 → 0 ORU) to prevent "Utopic Future" from being destroyed. Yuma then activates his face-down " Hi-Five the Sky " to negate the effects of "Utopic Future" and allow it to make a second attack in a row. Yuma activates his face-down " Memories of Courage " (as a "Number" Xyz Monster he controlled with no Overlay Units battled an opponent's "Number" Xyz Monster with no Overlay Units) to increase the ATK of "Utopic Future" by 500 for each "Number" monster in either player's Graveyard ("Utopic Future": 0 → 4000 ATK) and prevent it from being destroyed by battle.
 
         "Utopic Future"  destroys  " The Door of Destiny ".     
 "Utopic Future" attacks and destroys "Utopic Dragon". As no Battle Damage was inflicted, the final effect of "Memories of Courage" lets "Utopic Future" attack once again in a row. "Utopic Future" attacks directly, but Astral activates his face-down " The Door of Destiny ", which is Special Summoned as a monster ( 1/0/0) in Attack Position and negates the attack. Astral intends to use the second effect of "The Door of Destiny" on his next  Standby Phase  to banish all of his "Number" monsters from his Graveyard and inflict 500 damage to Yuma for each banished monster. As the attack of a monster was negated, Yuma activates "Double or Nothing!" to double the ATK of "Utopic Future" ("Utopic Future": 4000 → 8000 ATK) and allow it to attack again. "Utopic Future" attacks and destroys "The Door of Destiny" (Astral: 550 → 0 LP).
