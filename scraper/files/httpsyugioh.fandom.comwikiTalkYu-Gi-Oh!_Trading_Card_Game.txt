It would be  really  nice if this article would say what the differences between  TCG  and  OCG  were.  Oddlyoko   talk 
 
 Better yet, this should be a redirect to Yu-Gi-Oh! Trading Card Game, while OCG should redirect to Yu-Gi-Oh! Official Card Game.-- TwoTailedFox  ( My Talk Page ) 20:30, 26 June 2007 (UTC)

 Exclusive Cards 
 Is there any listing about the cards that are exclusive for the OCG and the TCG somewhere?
Or is that only the OCG HAS the right to have exclusive cards?
 are japanese version cards legal in tournaments in northamerica? Tecson  13:28, November 11, 2009 (UTC)rb
 
 Any reference? 
 There's a note in the article stating that OCG cards are illegal in the TCG format, yet TCG cards (expect exclusives) are legal in the OCG. Does anyone have a reliable source stating this, or did someone just put this in because they assume that it's true despite Konami never actually saying so?

 Why? 
 Why exactly are OCG cards, even if they have been released in the TCG, illegal to use in TCG tournaments? OCG cards, especially the Korean ones, are much cheaper than the TCG cards, and they do the exact same thing. I don't want to spend twenty dollars on a Royal Decree, when I can buy three Korean ones for five. A Royal Decree is a Royal Decree, no matter where it is used, or what language it is in, everyone knows what they are. 
German, Spanish, and other European languages are allowed in American TCG tournaments, that is no differant than Japanese or Korean cards.
