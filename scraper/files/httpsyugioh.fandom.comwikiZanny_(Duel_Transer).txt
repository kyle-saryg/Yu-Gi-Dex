 Trivia 
 Although this Deck is based on the theme of "Turtle" monsters (Japanese: 亀  kame , and タートル  tātoru ), with the inclusion of 2 "Tortoise" monsters, there are 2 monsters that are seemingly outliers: " Naturia Stinkbug " and " Bombardment Beetle ".
 However, the Japanese card name of "Bombardment Beetle" is  爆 弾 かめ 虫  ( Bakudan  Kame mushi ), aka "Bomb Stink Bug" in English. This card's inclusion here is a reference to the fact that the Japanese word for "turtle" is contained in its Japanese name.
 In turn, even though there is no such reference in the Japanese card name of "Naturia Stinkbug", that card is included here because of its relation to "Bombardment Beetle" and the fact that it is a  Tuner monster  that can be used to Synchro Summon " Naturia Landoise ".
