 Yu-Gi-Oh! ZEXAL  (pronounced /zeaɾɯ/ in Japanese, mimicking the English word "zeal"; pronounced /ˈzek.səl/ "ZECK-sul" in English) is a  Yu-Gi-Oh!  anime and manga series and the successor to the  Yu-Gi-Oh! 5D's  series. It was followed by  Yu-Gi-Oh! ARC-V  on April 6, 2014.
 The anime first aired on April 11, 2011 in popular evening slots in Japan on  TV Tokyo . [3]  It introduces the  Xyz Summon  mechanic and  Xyz Monsters . It also starts the use of the Series 7 card layout replacing the Series 3 layout used in later episodes of  Yu-Gi-Oh! , and the majority of episodes of  Yu-Gi-Oh! GX  and  Yu-Gi-Oh! 5D's .
 Starting with the show's fourth arc, the show was advertised under the name  Yu-Gi-Oh! ZEXAL II  (pronounced  zay-al [IPA: zeɪal] sekando  in Japanese, pronounced  zek-sul second  in English), but both NAS and TV Tokyo classify it as the same show, with the episode numbers continuing from where it was left off instead of returning to the start. [4] [5] 
 The first season of the English dubbed version premiered on October 15, 2011 on the CW4KIDS Toonzai. The second season was brought to CW4KIDS's second Cartoon Block, Vortexx. Official English subtitled episodes can be found on Hulu, though only available within the United States thus far.
 Vortexx came to an end on September 27, 2014, and was replaced with a live-action E/I block from  Litton Entertainment  named  One Magnificent Morning . [6] [7]  On July 11, 2014, it was announced that new episodes of  Yu-Gi-Oh! ZEXAL  would premiere on  yugioh.com  each week up until the conclusion of Season 3. [8] 
 As of February 22, 2015, all episodes of Yu-Gi-Oh! ZEXAL (146 total) have been dubbed into English.

           Japanese Yu-Gi-Oh! ZEXAL ( 遊☆戯☆王 ＺＥＸＡＬ ) logo     
           Dubbed version title screen     
 The series is set in a city in the near future,  Heartland City . In this era, children and adults enjoy  Augmented Reality Duels . Augmented Reality Duels are Duels that use  Duel Gazers  and  D-Pads , which when the two are used together, whether on the ground or in the sky, cause monsters to erupt from buildings and fight each other. The hero is  Yuma Tsukumo . At a beginner level, he's a champion at absolutely losing. Due to a chain of events, Yuma ends up challenging the number one delinquent at his school,  Reginald . His destiny is changed by a bizarre  door  he's seen in his dreams. When Yuma unlocks this sealed door, countless lights fly from it and escape. And when Yuma comes to, he sees the mysterious entity,  Astral , who came from a parallel universe, standing before him.
 In order to regain Astral's lost memories, the flying lights from the door that have turned into the 99 " Numbers " cards, these two must work together. A series of mysterious and powerful rivals begin to appear before Yuma and Astral including a young boy named  Kite Tenjo , revenge-seeking  Vetrix  and the maniacal  Dr. Faker .

 Manga 
 Main article:  Yu-Gi-Oh! ZEXAL (manga) 
 The  Yu-Gi-Oh! ZEXAL  manga is written by Shin Yoshida, illustrated by Naoto Miyashi and published by  Shueisha . Unlike  Yu-Gi-Oh! GX  and  Yu-Gi-Oh! 5D's , the  Yu-Gi-Oh! ZEXAL  manga was released before the anime and follows the same story as the anime up until  Rank 009 .
 The series is set in the near future. Something unexpected happens as  Ryoga Kamishiro  challenges  Yuma Tsukumo  to a Duel. When the mysterious entity  Astral  appears before them a new legend begins. [9] 
 
 Spin-off 
 Main article:  Yu-Gi-Oh! D Team ZEXAL 
 Yu-Gi-Oh! D Team ZEXAL  is a spin-off of the series made by Akihiro Tomonaga with the cooperation of Wedge Holdings. This spin-off is non-canon to the anime and manga series, and focuses on humor.
 Just like in the anime and manga, the series is set in the near future. However, it has no relation to them. Here,  Yuma  already knows  Astral  since the beginning, and forms a  Dueling Team  with  Kotori ,  Tetsuo  and  Takashi .

 An encore screening of  Yu-Gi-Oh! 3D Bonds Beyond Time  on February 20, 2011 in Japan contained details on the production of  Yu-Gi-Oh! ZEXAL . The second 2011 issue of  Weekly Shonen Jump  included details of the screening a competition on how one hundred and ten readers can win passes to see it. [11]

 Differences in adaptations 
 Some names are Americanized. 
 The names on the  Duelist 's picture are removed. 
 The Win Sound Effect is changed in the English dub. 
 Skirts and socks on female characters are lengthened to avoid any sexual implications. 
 Astral 's lower body is blurred out to avoid references to nudity. 
 The backs of the cards have been edited to become the standard backing seen in the other series, with an exception in the first 8 episodes, when they re-aired, the backings are changed. In  episode 26  and onward, the backing of the cards changed to how they appear in the World Duel Carnival arc, just like the Japanese version. 
 The scenes depicting  Numbers  users aging from " Photon Hand " is cut. Although this isn't the case when Kite takes Reginald Kastle's soul. 
 When an Overlay Unit is used, the sound effect has been replaced with a new one. 
 The Life Point sound effect is replaced with a different one than the original. 
 There are 3 seasons in the dub. 
 References to death or killing of characters are toned down, worded indirectly, or removed.

 Trivia 
 Despite the fact it's implied the holograms are only viewable through D-Gazers and therefore not actually there, characters have been thrown by explosions during the Duels not involving power from either Astral or Barian world. 
 ZEXAL  is the first spin-off series where the main protagonist never has any in-person encounter with the main protagonist of its predecessor series throughout its canonical plotline. (In  5D's , Yusei and Jaden did meet in the movie  Yu-Gi-Oh! 3D Bonds Beyond Time  which follows  5D's  canonical plotline, thus making  ZEXAL  the first series where the current main protagonist does not interact personally with the main protagonist of its predecessor series.)
 It is also the first series where the new type of monster introduced (in this case,  Xyz Monsters ) does not have a  Level  (instead, they have a  Rank ). 
 ZEXAL  is the first series to be completely dubbed since the  original series . 
 In the dub, this series has a  two-part   episode  with the same name as a  two-part   episode  from the original series, making this the first series to have a two-part episode with the same name as one from another series. 
 This is the last Filipino-dubbed series aired in the Philippines.
