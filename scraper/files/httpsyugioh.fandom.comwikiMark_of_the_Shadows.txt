A  Mark of the Shadows  (known as a  "Dark Mark"  in the Japanese version) is a mark appearing on a  Dark Signer . All Dark Signers except  Rex Goodwin  have their Mark of the Shadows on their arm (in the case of Rex Goodwin, he had the Condor Mark on his back).
 Each mark corresponds to one of the seven  Earthbound Immortals . Having the dark mark allows the Dark Signer to use the corresponding Earthbound Immortal as a card.
 They are based off the  Nazca Lines  in southern Peru.

 History 
 These marks were given to  Roman Goodwin ,  Devack ,  Kalin Kessler ,  Misty Tredwell ,  Carly Carmine ,  Greiger  and  Rex Goodwin  by the Immortals themselves, when they were close to dying. Roman obtained his Mark of the Shadows from the core of the Original Ener-D Reactor itself. It is unknown how Devack gained his mark and powers for it was never mentioned. All of the the dark marks have appeared on the Dark Signers right arm, except the condor which is instead on Rex Goodwin's back.
 
 Behavior 
 The  Signer  equivalent of the Mark of the Shadows is the  Mark of the Dragon . Both identify a person belonging to either group and react to one another whenever a Dark Signer and a Signer are near one another. Also, both marks are active while a Dark Signer and a Signer are facing against each other within a  Shadow Duel . The Mark of the Shadows will glow even brighter, if its owner is getting taken over by their Earthbound Immortal (this is evidenced during the Duels with Misty, Carly, and Greiger).
