 The building is divided into different levels. Higher levels require access keys to get into. The access key is simply slid through a device to open the door. [1] 
 The building has tight security. Various surveillance cameras are set up in the hallways. Facial recognition can be applied to people seen on the camera. Facial details are compared with those of people they have on file in order to identify them. Fingerprints can also be read and compared to people they have on file. This was used to identify  Yusei Fudo  and  Sherry LeBlanc  went they infiltrated the building, posing as employees of  Bolger & Company . [1]

 History 
 Moment Express has a history with  Iliaster  and have done projects with  Bolger & Company . [1] 
 Moment Express phoned  Lazar  to inform him of the arrival of the  Three Emperors of Iliaster . When Lazar told  Yusei  and his friends about this, he did not know who the company that phones him was, but knew how to find out. He took them to the  Accel Simulator  arcade game, where records of  Sector Security  were hidden, including who the company that phoned him was. [2] [4] 
 Yusei,  Sherry  and  Bruno  infiltrated the Moment Express headquarters posing as employees of  Bolger & Company , Daniel, Eva and Timothy. They managed to learn about Infinity. While Yusei tested a Duel Runner in the tubes, Bruno and Sherry hacked into the computer system, but were unable to find information on Iliaster. They suspected that the information they needed was hidden away in a higher level of the building, so they snuck into Clark's office to steal his access card. Unbeknownst to them, Clark had already identified them through the security system. When Clark went to his office, Sherry and Bruno snuck out through a ventilation shaft, while Yusei faced Clark in a  Concentration Duel  to buy them time. While they Dueled, Bruno and Sherry managed to copy a file on Iliaster onto a flash drive. After the Duel, Clark revealed that he knew their identities and set off an alarm. Yusei caught up with Bruno and Sherry and tried to escape. They ended up hiding in a shuttle, which was part of a trap. The shuttle was locked and moved to Infinity to have them transported elsewhere. [1] 
 The  Three Pure Nobles , in an effort to erase traces of their conspiracy from Yusei and the others, used Infinity to alter history, causing Moment Express to disappear from existence. [3]
