 " Furry Fury ", known as " Yuma Confused!? The Unreliable Account of Girag the Tanuki " in the Japanese version, is the one hundredth and seventh episode of the  Yu-Gi-Oh! ZEXAL  anime. It first aired in Japan on June 9, 2013 and in the United States on April 26, 2014.
 Yuma  returns to his  house  for the first time in a long time, to take a break from his adventures to the ruins. But his rest is fleeting, as he learns from  Roku , that the  Ksitigarbha  of a Warring States Commander from 500 years ago has been found at the  Duel Sanctuary . But as Yuma and  Astral  rush to the lodge, the  Barian  Warrior,  Girag , is waiting for them. To defend the " Number ", Yuma challenges Girag to a  Duel , but it appears that he's been possessed by something.
 
 Summary 
       Girag's legend.     
 Yuma  returns home for the first time in a long time, to rest after all he's done in his search for the " Mythyrian Numbers ".  Kari  berates him for wandering off after quite some time. She calls him an idiot and chides him for getting  Tori  involved. Tori tries to explain further, but Yuma interrupts her, saying it couldn't be helped and a mountain of things went on (in the dub, Kari calls Yuma a weasel and berates him for not being home for dinner, which was some time ago. Tori says this was not Yuma's fault, while Yuma defends her, saying Kari should listen to her).  Haru  chimes in, saying this is Yuma they're talking about; those things had something to do with Dueling. Yuma agrees with his grandmother; Dueling is a huge adventure. Kari disagrees with Yuma, warning him to watch his mouth, and locks him into a chokehold (in the dub, Kari threatens to shorten Yuma's life time). They are interrupted by a voice on the TV-- Roku  greets Yuma and Haru. The reporter next to him appears flustered. She clears her throat and begins her story.
 
         Roku announcing the discovery.     
 Roku discovered a statue dedicated to Commander Kiraku, the military general of the Sengoku Era, in the  Duel Sanctuary . This has been a popular topic among other people. As the reporter continues, Tori wonders where she had seen the face before. A close up of the statue appears on screen and Yuma and Tori are shocked that the statue bears a great resemblance to  Girag . The reporter asks Roku about what kind of person Kiraku was. Roku replies that Kiraku was very good at fighting. He fought with the surrounding generals and donated the treasures to the peasants in his territory. He was a frugal person himself, earning him the reputation of a legendary ruler. Yuma repeats, "Legendary?" in bewilderment (in the dub, Yuma comments that there is no doubt that Girag's face is on the statue). The reporter says it seemed that Roku discovered more things besides the statue. Roku confirms it; behind him  Kaze  opens a box and presents Kiraku's treasures. Among them is a  King's Coin . Yuma is surprised that  his father's  coin is there.  Astral  replies there is no mistake; the Duel Sancturary was there on the  Different Dimension Airship 's map. Yuma yells at Astral that he should have told him sooner and runs off. Kari yells at her brother to come back. Tori tells Kari to excuse them before leaving herself. 
 
       Girag and the Kiraku statue.     
 Girag, in the hideout that he and  Alito  used during the Barian Invasion, is watching the TV he broke previously.  Scarlett Starling 's commercial plays on screen and Girag grumbles that looking for " Numbers " is a waste of time. The commercial starts to fizzle out and Girag tries to fix the TV. The news report that Yuma and Tori were watching earlier replaces the commercial Girag was watching. As Girag looks at the statue, he notes that it looks like him. He makes his way to the Duel Sanctuary and finds the statue in the middle of the room. He repeats that the statue looks like him and wonders what in the world it is. A  blank card  slips out of the statue's mouth and Girag takes it. To his surprise, the card is a "Number". A voice saying, "Kiraku" emanates from the room. The statue's eyes open and Girag falls back in shock. The voice continues that it had been waiting for him. Girag is horrified that the statue spoke, turning around and running away from it. 
 Yuma, Tori and Astral walk up the mountain to the Duel Sanctuary. Tori says if the protagonists of the legends are really the Barians, then Girag must be part of these legends. Yuma is confused about Girag being a great general once (in the dub, Tori asks why Kiraku is the spitting image of Girag, while Yuma replies that Kiraku may be Girag's Barian great-grandfather). Suddenly, they see someone and a statue rolling down the stairs. Yuma pushes Tori away to safety, and takes the hit, rolling away with the person and statue down back at the platform. Tori and Astral run after them. The former asks Yuma if he is okay as he gets up. Behind them, Girag rises to his feet. However, he does not speak in his usual voice and he exclaims that he is finally free. Yuma recognizes him. Girag, with a red nose and whiskers, turns around and quizzically asks, "Pon?" ("Who?" in the dub) Yuma is confused and repeats that he is looking at Girag. Girag starts to walk away; Yuma yells at him to wait and asks if he recognizes him. Girag bows and says it's a pleasure to meet him, then. He turns around and leaves. Behind them, a voice tells Yuma and Girag to wait. The voice belongs to the real Girag and the statue places itself back upright. It shakes and yells at the other Girag to give back his body. Yuma and Tori exclaim that the statue spoke. From the statue, Girag insists that he is the real Girag. This leaves both Yuma and Tori confused. Girag says he has no idea how, but he got trapped inside the statue, while the other being who took his body is the  Number Guardian . Astral repeats, "Spirit of the Number?" (in the dub, Astral remarks on the astonishing situation) Yuma is even more confused; the statue is Girag and Girag is the statue. Girag says he knew everything about Yuma. Yuma secretly stole Tori's food from her lunchbox in  Heartland Academy . Girag warns Yuma not to underestimate the Barians' data network (in the dub, Girag knows about this because he saw Yuma do it); in reality, Girag actually took notes in a notebook as he watched Yuma. Tori is angry at Yuma for this because she never had much to eat during the day. Yuma denies it and asks the statue how he can prove that it's really Girag. Girag yells at Yuma if he had forgotten about  their last Duel . Yuma finally recognizes Girag. The Number Guardian chuckles and confirms that he and Girag indeed traded places. From now on, he will live as Kiraku. Yuma repeats what the Guardian said in surprise. The Guardian says he had been waiting in the statue for his freedom for a long time. And now, Kiraku's aura appeared before him. Astral confirms that Kiraku Souhachi really is Girag. Girag pleads to Yuma to win a Duel against the Guardian and get his body back. Yuma asks Girag on why he should do that. Girag replies that there is a "Number". Yuma is surprised, but Astral tells him that when there is a "Number" involved in a Duel, they have no other choice but to accept. Yuma agrees and accepts the Duel, despite not knowing what is going on.
 
         Girag's previous incarnation holding Ponta.     
 The Guardian calls this interesting and says he will not forgive anyone who tried to steal his freedom (in the dub, the Guardian says he waited a long time for his freedom and he will not give it up now). Both players arm their  D-Pads  and their  Duel Gazers  and start the Duel. From the sidelines, Tori and Girag encourage Yuma that he can do it. The Guardian takes the first turn and  Normal Summons  " Baby Raccoon Ponpoko . As the monster appears and beats its drum, Tori squees at its cuteness. The Guardian then  activates  the  Spell Card  " Leaf Transformation ", allowing him to  Special Summon  a " Raccoon " monster from his hand; he Summons " Baby Raccoon Tantan ". Astral warns Yuma that the "Number" is coming. Yuma says he knows. The Guardian  overlays  his two Level 2 monsters and chants, "The sage that slays the chaos and chaotic world! Make the world change!" He  Xyz Summons  " Number 64: Ronin Raccoon Sandayu " in  Attack Position . Yuma says this must be the "Number" from the ruins. The Guardian activates the effect of "Sandayu", detaching an  Overlay Unit  to Special Summon a " Kagemusha Raccoon Token ". "Sandayu" performs a series of hand seals and the  Token  appears next to it in a puff of smoke (the hand seals are cut from the dub). The ATK of the "Kagemusha Raccoon Token" will become the same as the monster with the highest ATK. Girag exclaims, "What'd you say?!" A leaf appears in the hand of the "Kagemusha Raccoon Token" and it places it on its head. The Token disappears in a puff of smoke and a copy of "Sandayu" with silver armor appears in its place. The Guardian continues that while there is another  Beast - Type  monster, "Sandayu cannot be attacked. Yuma says that "Sandayu" and the Token only have 1000 ATK; he is not scared of either of them (this line is cut from the dub). The Guardian warns Yuma not to underestimate the power of shadows and ends his turn.
 Yuma repeats "Shadows," but Astral reminds him to take the next turn (this part is removed from the dub). He draws " Dododo Swordsman ". He is pleased that he drew it and  Sets  a card. The Guardian mutters, "that card" as a glint appears in his eye. A fan appears in his hand and the Guardian starts to dance. Yuma and the others are confused as to what is going on (the Guardian's dance is cut from the dub). When the Guardian is finished, transparent circles come out of his eyes and come towards Yuma. Yuma slumps forward slightly. Astral calls out to him. As he does so, three whiskers grow out of each of Yuma's cheeks. From the other side, Yuma asks why he is seeing himself. Then he realizes that he is in Girag's body and also asks why the Guardian has his face (in the dub, Yuma also exclaims that the Guardian can now see his cards). The Guardian taps on Yuma's Duel Gazer and looks at the Set card, which is " Burst Rebirth " (the text from Yuma's Duel Gazer is removed from the dub). His hand contains " Monster Reborn ", "Dododo Swordsman", " Guard Plus ", " Dododo Witch " and " Toy Knight ". He smirks and Special Summons "Toy Knight" as he controls no monsters. Astral repeats the Guardian's verbal tic, "pon" (in the dub, Astral warns Yuma that this is the wrong play). From Girag's body, Yuma calls out to Astral and Tori, saying that it really is him, Yuma Tsukumo. Tori is confused and Yuma reiterates his name. He apologizes to Tori for stealing from her lunchbox. Tori recognizes him and Girag and Astral deduce that the Guardian traded bodies with Yuma. The Guardian chuckles and Yuma calls him an impostor jerk (in the dub, Yuma yells at the Guardian to give back his body). The Guardian says he is the master of Yuma's body now, which is why he knows of Yuma's Set card; it was intended to Summon "that card". As he controls a Spell or  Trap Card , the Guardian Special Summons "Dododo Witch" in Attack Position. Astral says there are two Level 4 monsters now. The Guardian has other plans for them; he  Tributes  his monsters to  Tribute Summon  "Dododo Swordsman" to Yuma's horror. Astral notes that it has 0 ATK. Normally, he and Yuma would have Xyz Summoned " Number 39: Utopia ". The Guardian activates "Monster Reborn", Special Summoning "Toy Knight" from the Graveyard in Attack Position. He activates "Guard Plus". This lets him Tribute a monster to increase the DEF of a monster equal to the ATK of the Tributed monster. He Tributes "Toy Knight" and targets "Swordsman", increasing its DEF by 200. Yuma exclaims that there is no point in doing that when "Swordsman" is in Attack Position. The Guardian orders "Swordsman" to attack the "Kagemusha Raccoon Token". Yuma curses, saying the Guardian will take the damage. The Guardian tells him not to be so sure as he returns Yuma to his body and regains control of Girag's. Both monsters clash their blades, then the Token cleaves "Swordsman" in half. Yuma exclaims, "No way!" as he is knocked back and reduced to 3000  LP . The Guardian opens his fan and says he liked Kiraku better. Yuma gets up and asks the Guardian why he is doing all of this.
 The Guardian admits that he used to be Kiraku's Kagemusha, or "shadow warrior". Yuma repeats, "kagemusha?" and the Guardian reminds him about Kiraku's legend; instead of Kiraku himself, the Guardian was the one who won on the battlefield. Therefore, the legend exists because of him, a tanuki. Everyone exclaims, "tanuki?!" Yuma asks if the Guardian used to be a tanuki. Tori says he did have a tendency to say "pon" a lot and Girag notes that he uses a "Raccoon" Deck (Tori's and Girag's comments are cut from the dub). Astral asks himself if the Guardian really is a tanuki (in the dub, he calls this an interesting development). The Guardian recalls that he met Kiraku while on the battlefield. As a tanuki, he was lost and Kiraku saved him. In order to repay his kindness, the Guardian transformed into Kiraku and became his kagemusha. He fought in Kiraku's place and remembered that he was strong and smart. The Guardian made the country stronger, strong enough to conquer all (Kiraku and the Guardian proposing a toast is cut from the dub). Later, Kiraku ended up firing the Guardian out of jealousy for his strength. As a result, Kiraku ended up losing on the battlefield and got killed. If the Guardian had been out there, he would have won. Eventually, the Guardian died as a tanuki, but before he realized it, his soul was trapped in the statue of Kiraku. He had become the kagemusha of a dead man. The Guardian says he was tired of becoming a shadow and wanted to become real. Girag yells at him to shut up (in the dub, he calls the Guardian a thief) and urges Yuma to win the Duel. Astral reminds Yuma that since Girag is not in his body, they can defeat the Guardian and obtain the "Number" (in the dub, Astral reminds Yuma that there is a "Number" at stake and they must win the Duel). Yuma says he knows and admits to the Guardian that while Girag may be despicable, he is also stingy and annoying (in the dub, Yuma calls Girag a bully, a cheater and a liar, which are his good traits). Girag angrily says this was uncalled for. Yuma continues that he can't bring himself to hate Girag. Astral mutters Yuma's name. The Guardian yells that he does not care because he hated Kiraku more enough already. He starts his turn and activates the effect of "Sandayu", detaching an Overlay Unit to Special Summon another "Kagemusha Raccoon Token", which takes on the form of "Sandayu" as it has the highest ATK on the field. The Guardian attacks Yuma directly with "Sandayu". "Sandayu" opens its mouth and releases a stream of fire from it, reducing Yuma's LP to 2000. The Guardian commands a "Kagemusha Raccoon Token" to attack Yuma directly, as it performs the same attack "Sandayu" did. This brings Yuma to 1000 LP. The Guardian declares the final direct attack with the second Token. Yuma tells him not be so sure about that, adding "pon" at the end of the statement. The Guardian realizes that the Set card was what Yuma himself would have used to Summon "Dododo Witch". He says he will not fear the shadows as the "Kagemusha Raccoon Token" begins its attack. Yuma activates his  face-down  "Burst Rebirth",  paying  half his LP to Special Summon a monster from his Graveyard in face-down Defense Position. He Special Summons "Dododo Swordsman". Remembering that "Swordsman" has 3000 DEF, the Guardian orders the Token to stop the attack. He looks at his hand and thinks he still has " Raccoon Reversal ". He Sets it and ends his turn. The Guardian declares that he will defeat Yuma after what Kiraku did. It was about time Kiraku became the Guardian's Kagemusha.
 Yuma says he can't afford to lose. Astral says Yuma's name, and they nod to each other. Yuma begins his turn and draws " Chow Chow Chan ". He  Flip Summons  "Dododo Swordsman". The Guardian asks why Yuma would have a monster with 0 ATK in Attack Position. Astral corrects him; when "Swordsman" is Flip Summoned, it gains ATK equal to the difference between both players' LP, which is 3500. Yuma activates the other effect of "Swordsman", destroying two monsters his opponent controls. He targets the "Kagemusha Raccoon Tokens". "Swordsman" charges at the Tokens and slices them up with its swords. The Guardian exclaims, "My shadows!" Yuma declares an attack on "Sandayu" with "Swordsman". As "Swordsman" readies its attacks, Girag recalls the memories of the times he spent with the Guardian. He mutters, "Po..." The Guardian activates his face-down "Raccoon Reversal". When a "Raccoon" monster battles, the attacking monster is destroyed and Yuma takes damage equal to its ATK. He declares that he won. Yuma yells, "No you don't!" and activates the effect of "Chow Chow Chan" in his hand. When an opponent's Trap Card is activated, Yuma can send it to the Graveyard and use the activated Trap Card as if it was his. "Chow Chow Chan" barks, grabs the Trap Card the Guardian activated and runs off with it. This time, "Raccoon Reversal" activates on Yuma's field, destroying "Sandayu" and inflicting 1000 damage to the Guardian. Yuma yells " kattobingu " and attacks directly with "Swordsman". "Swordsman" removes its  kasa  and throws it at the Guardian. It strikes the Guardian on the chest, knocking him back. As the attack connects, the Guardian wonders why he did all of this as he recalls the memories he spent with Kiraku. From the statue, Girag yells the Guardian's name, which is  Ponta . Ponta crashes into the staircase behind him, his LP reduced to 0. 
 After the Duel, Girag hops over to where Ponta crashed. Ponta mutters that he isn't a shadow (in the dub, Ponta mutters that he is a failure). Girag recalls the Guardian as Ponta, calling this moment nostalgic. Yuma asks if this was the real Kiraku, while Tori concludes that Girag is really Kiraku. Ponta asks Girag on why he abandoned him. Girag reveals that he had sent Ponta away so that he would be able to live, as he knew he would lose his next battle. Ponta exclaims that this can't be true because if he fought, they would have won. Girag elaborates that the vassals were not happy that the peasants received the wealth while they did not; they rebelled against him because of this. Before he realized it, things got out of hand. He was thinking that at the very least, he wanted Ponta to escape. Ponta yells that can't be and he did not like that because he wanted to fight with Kiraku so that they could be together. He holds on to the statue's shoulders and sobs. Yuma mutters Ponta's name, while Tori sheds a tear. Ponta entrusts Yuma with the "Number" as a token of gratitude for reuniting him and Kiraku. Yuma reminds Astral on what to do and he nods. He extends his hand and absorbs the "Number" from Ponta. The Guardian falls to his knees and his ethereal form emerges from Girag's body. He mutters Kiraku's name. Suddenly, Girag yells that he tricked Ponta. The statue breaks apart and Girag's soul emerges from it, with eyes glowing as if he were possessed. He grabs Ponta and devours him, absorbing his spirit (Girag devouring Ponta is cut from the dub, though it may be implied that he still absorbed the Guardian's spirit). Yuma yells at Girag to stop it. Girag returns to his original body and glows with a red aura. He says he can't believe that Yuma and the others fell for his made-up story and calls them idiots. Yuma curses at Girag and he says that the next time he and Yuma met, he would defeat him, as he departs for the  Barian World . Yuma curses at Girag and Tori falls to her knees. As Girag travels between dimensions, he wonders  how he knew about the legend. A "pon!" is heard from Girag's body, implying that Ponta may still be alive (Girag traveling through the dimensions is cut from the dub).
 
 Featured Duel: Yuma Tsukumo vs. Ponta 
         Ponta  vs.  Yuma     
 Girag  has been body-swapped with  Ponta .
 Turn 1: Ponta 
 
         " Number 64: Ronin Raccoon Sandayu " is Summoned.     
 Ponta  draws. He then  Normal Summons  " Baby Raccoon Ponpoko " ( 2/800/0) in Attack Position. Ponta then  activates  " Leaf Transformation " to  Special Summon  " Baby Raccoon Tantan " (a " Raccoon "  monster ) ( 2/0/800) in  Attack Position . Ponta  overlays  "Baby Raccoon Ponpoko" and "Baby Raccoon Tantan" in order to  Xyz Summon  " Number 64: Ronin Raccoon Sandayu " ( 2/1000/1000, ORU: 2) in Attack Position. 
 Pona activates the last effect of "Ronin Raccoon Sandayu" to  detach  an  Overlay Unit  ("Ronin Raccoon Sandayu": 2 → 1 ORU) and Special Summon a " Kagemusha Raccoon Token " in Attack Position with its ATK equal to the monster on the field with the highest ATK ( 1/? → 1000/0). Due to the second effect of "Ronin Raccoon Sandayu", while Ponta  controls  a "Kagemusha Raccoon Token", "Ronin Raccoon Sandayu" cannot be  attacked .
 Turn 2: Yuma 
 
         Ponta  wastes Yuma's cards.     
 Yuma  draws "Dododo Swordsman". He then  Sets  " Burst Rebirth ". At this point, the spirit of Ponta body swaps with Yuma. As Ponta controls no monsters, he Special Summons " Toy Knight " ( 4/200/1200) in Attack Position via its own effect. As he has a  Set   Spell / Trap Card , Ponta Special Summons " Dododo Witch " ( 4/1200/1600) in Attack Position via its own effect. 
 Ponta  Tributes  "Toy Knight" and "Dododo Witch" in order to  Tribute Summon  " Dododo Swordsman " ( 8/0/3000) in Attack Position. He then activates " Monster Reborn " to revive "Toy Knight" ( 4/200/1200) in Attack Position. Ponta then activates " Guard Plus " to Tribute "Toy Knight" and increase the  DEF  of "Dododo Swordsman" equal to the ATK of "Toy Knight" ("Dododo Swordsman": 3000 → 3200 DEF). "Dododo Swordsman" attacks the "Kagemusha Raccoon Token", with Ponta body swapping with Yuma. The "Kagemusha Racooon Token" then destroys "Dododo Swordsman" (Yuma: 4000 → 3000 LP).
 Turn 3: Ponta 
Ponta draws. He then activates the effect of "Ronin Raccoon Sandayu" ("Ronin Raccoon Sandayu": 1 → 0 ORU) to Special Summon another "Kagemusha Raccoon Token" ( 1/? → 1000/0) in Attack Position. "Ronin Raccoon Sandayu" and a "Kagemusha Raccoon Token" attack  directly  (Yuma: 3000 → 2000 → 1000 LP). The second "Kagemusha Racoon Token" attacks directly, but Yuma activates his  face-down  "Burst Rebirth" to  pay  half his  LP  (Yuma: 1000 → 500 LP) and revive "Dododo Swordsman" in face-down Defense Position. A  replay  occurs and Ponta chooses not to attack. Ponta Sets " Raccoon Reversal ".
 Turn 4: Yuma 
 
         Ponta loses.     
 Yuma  draws  "Chow Chow Chan". He then  Flip Summons  "Dododo Swordsman" ( 8/0/3000). Yuma then activates the Flip Effect of "Dododo Swordsman" to destroy the "Kagemusha Raccoon Tokens" and increase it ATK by the difference between the LP of both players ("Dododo Swordsman": 0 → 3500 ATK).
 "Dododo Swordsman" attacks "Ronin Raccoon Sandayu", but Ponta activates his face-down "Raccoon Reversal" (as a " Raccoon " monster was targeted for an attack) to destroy "Dododo Swordsman" (the attacking monster) and inflict  damage  to Yuma equal to the destroyed monster's ATK. Yuma activates the effect of " Chow Chow Chan " to  send  it from his hand to the Graveyard,  negate  the activation of "Raccoon Reversal", and activate the effect of the negated Trap Card as if Yuma used it himself. Through the effect of "Raccoon Reversal", Yuma destroys "Ronin Raccoon Sandayu" (Ponta: 4000 → 3000 LP). A replay occurs and Yuma uses "Dododo Swordsman" to attack directly (Ponta: 3000 → 0 LP).
