 Production 
 Yu-Gi-Oh! GX  is produced by Nihon Ad Systems, Inc., and directed by Hatsuki Tsuji. Scripts are prepared by an alternating lineup of writers -  Shin Yoshida , Jun Maekawa, Akemi Omode, Yasuyuki Suzuki-with music arrangements by Yutaka Minobe. Takuya Hiramitsu is in charge of sound direction, supervised by Yūji Mitsuya. Character and monster designs are overseen by Kenichi Hara, while Duel layout is overseen by Masahiro Hikokubo.
 The "GX" in the series' title is short for the term "Generation neXt". "GENEX" was also the tentative title of the series as evidenced in early promotional work, and also refers to the  Genex Tournament  that takes place between episodes  84  and  104 .
 Like many English adaptations of other anime series,  Yu-Gi-Oh! GX  is edited due to Americanization. The names of many characters and cards underwent alteration, and card faces and text are edited to only include  ATK / DEF  statistics,  Attribute  for monsters, and card type for  Spell  and  Trap Cards . Spell Cards in particular are referred to as such to reflect the revised printing format that surfaced in the Yu-Gi-Oh! Trading Card Game from  Magician's Force  onwards, though the original term "Magic Card" has been used on several occasions, either due to scripting error or for very specific reasons. Furthermore monster stat displays and  Life Point  counters, previously in blue and gold print, become digital readouts with color-coded energy bars. The original music score is replaced with a rock-style soundtrack. Darker and more controversial themes such as death, murder, and religion - which were incorporated into the Japanese version - are toned down in the English version.
 
 Themes and structure 
 Although the first half of the anime's first season began on a whimsical note, the latter half established a noticeably darker atmosphere by introducing supernatural elements similar to those present in the original  Yu-Gi-Oh!  franchise, such as magic, the  Shadow Games , and various myths, along with Judeo-Christian subtext. The second season had a strong thematic presence built on destiny, with ties to the  Cthulhu Mythos  of  H.P. Lovecraft  and drew on  space opera  as a plot device. The third season continued this trend, but with much greater emphasis on emotional torment, with alternate dimensions serving as its primary settings. The third season is easily the darkest, with large number of the main cast appearing to die over the course. Even though most later return, they are believed by both the viewer and the remaining characters to be dead. The fourth season continues character-driven plotlines established in the first season, such as  Chazz Princeton 's desire to duel professionally, and the students that vanished in the abandoned dormitory.
 The program is divided into episodes classified as "Turns". The title sequence and closing credits are accompanied by lyrics varying over the course of the series, with the former immediately followed by an individual episode's number and title. Eyecatches begin and end commercial breaks halfway through each episode; in the first season, there were two eyecatches per episode, usually showcasing the opponents and their key monsters for a given episode while in later seasons, a single eyecatch appears with only the duelists. After the credits, a preview of the next episode, narrated most frequently by KENN and Masami Suzuki, is made, followed by a brief "Today's Strongest Card" segment.
 In the English version, the title sequence is accompanied by the song " Get Your Game On! ", as are the end credits (in a shortened form). Eyecatches, previews, and the "Today's Strongest Card" featurette are removed entirely.
 
 Story 
           Yu-Gi-Oh! Duel Monsters GX ( 遊☆戯☆王 デュエルモンスターズＧＸ) logo     Yu-Gi-Oh! GX  begins with the lead character,  Jaden Yuki , obtaining a " Winged Kuriboh " from  Yugi Muto , the renowned Duel Monsters champion. Yu-Gi-Oh! GX follows the exploits of Jaden and his companions as he attends  Duel Academy  ( Duel Academia ). The series is set 10 years after the original series.
 The Academy was founded by  Seto Kaiba  on a remote island in the Southern Seas, with its dormitories named after the three  Egyptian God Cards , and is run by  Chancellor Sheppard  ( Principal Samejima ) and his staff. The most elaborate dormitory,  Obelisk Blue  (オベリスク・ブルー  Oberisuku Burū ), is named after " Obelisk the Tormentor ". The Obelisk Blue dormitory can be graduated to, but the only way to enter the dorm in the first year is to attend and do well at an affiliated junior school (English version only). As the highest ranked dormitory, Obelisk Blue's facilities are of the highest quality, on the level of the world's classiest hotels and restaurants. The center dorm,  Ra Yellow  (ラー・イェロー  Rā Ierō ), is named after " The Winged Dragon of Ra ". Those who were given the highest scores in the entrance exam, or whose performance was mediocre in the junior school enter this dormitory, which, while not as extravagant as Obelisk Blue, still has incredibly clean and well-kept facilities as well as meals of a quality far above the lifestyle of the average salaried man. The lowest dorm,  Slifer Red  (Osiris Red) (オシリス・レッド  Oshirisu Reddo ), is named after " Slifer the Sky Dragon ". Those who scored poorly are put into the shoddy dorms of Slifer Red. The naming choices reflect Kaiba's bias over the God Cards in relation to his rivalry with Yugi (Obelisk was Kaiba's own personal card in  Battle City , while Slifer was Yugi's, with Ra in the middle as the most desirable card out of the three until Yugi received it at the end of the story arc).
 For the first two years at  Duel Academy , the main cast faced major threats including the  Shadow Riders  ( Seven Stars ), who intended to revive the  Sacred Beasts  by creating a strong dueling presence on the island, as well as the  Society of Light , which intended to enslave humanity with the world-destroying satellite of  Misgarth  (in the dubbed version, their aim is to brainwash the world with the satellite). During the third year-right, as a result of  Thelonious Viper 's schemes ( Professor Cobra ),  Duel Academy  is transported to another world, a desert plane with three suns and resident Duel Monster spirits, right into the hands of  Yubel . Upon returning home, Jaden and a select group of his partners dive into the rift left in their escape to recover their missing companions and embark through second and third worlds where losing a duel is fatal. In the second half of their third year (Season 4), the characters reflect upon their upcoming graduation and what to do afterward, such as  Alexis Rhodes  considering becoming a teacher,  Syrus Truesdale  taking up  his brother 's legacy as a  Cyber Style  duelist and  Chazz Princeton  becoming a  Pro League  duelist to support  his   brothers . A villain named  Trueman  also appears and is somehow connected to Atticus and the abandoned dormitory. Later it is shown that Trueman was a minion of  Nightshroud  ( Darkness ), who was previously a secondary antagonist from the first season.
 
 Cast 
 Yu-Gi-Oh! GX sports many personalities. The principal cast is composed of series hero  Jaden Yuki , the passionate  Alexis Rhodes  and her whimsical brother  Atticus , the easily discouraged but determined  Syrus Truesdale , elitist  Chazz Princeton , the analytic  Bastion Misawa , the strong-willed  Tyranno Hassleberry , and the love-struck  Blair Flannigan . Supporting characters often have connections to the educative or professional dueling worlds, and include  Obelisk Blue  professor  Vellian Crowler , duelist-turned- Industrial Illusions  designer  Chumley Huffington , and  Pro League  powerhouses  Zane Truesdale  and  Aster Phoenix . The  Overseas Champions , like  Jesse Anderson , one of the closest of Jaden's friends, a group of foreign duelists introduced in the third year, would also find a place in Duel Academy's student body.
 Each season of the series has a primary antagonist. The first season has  Kagemaru  (Duel Academy's Chairman and leader of the  Shadow Riders , who wants to take the  Sacred Beasts  for himself). The second season has  Sartorius  (founder and leader of the  Society of Light , an enigmatic fortune-teller taken over by an  alien force  who uses his influence to bring people to his side). The third season has  Yubel  (creator of the  Martin Empire  and the  Survival Duels ), an evil, deranged, psychotic duel spirit that possesses and manipulates people to rule over all dimensions with  Jaden  by her side. The fourth season has  Nightshroud  (a former Shadow Rider that is revealed to be the fate of mankind itself, orchestrating a vicious siege to send all the human beings into the World of Darkness where they will ultimately give up on their own lives). So far, by the end of each season (with exception of the fourth), each of the primary antagonists seems to reform in some way. Kagemaru appeared to see the error his ways, Sartorius was under the Light of Destruction's influence over the whole season, and Yubel had also been driven insane by the Light of Destruction and was freed from it by Jaden and willingly merged with him. Nightshroud was defeated and destroyed by Jaden, but claimed to continue to exist as long as there is darkness in a person's heart.
 Also, in addition to the main cast, several cameos from the previous anime series appear within the show, most notably  Yugi Muto ,  Seto Kaiba ,  Pegasus  and  Solomon Muto .

 Changes made to the dub 
 Most characters' names. 
 Some cards' names. 
 Most  monsters' attack and effect names . 
 Changing the script, music and personalities to make the show more marketable to an American audience. 
 Altering or removing references to death, religion and violence. 
 Changing Life Point meters to digital readouts with color-coded energy bars. 
 Changing the sound effects, and replacing them with new ones. None of the original Japanese sound effects remain. 
 Removing Japanese and English text and sometimes replacing it with unreadable symbols. 
 Removing all scenes and mentions of blood and changing it to another brand of plasma. 
 Replacing references to death with being "sent to the stars", though death is still implied. 
 Yubel's voice is of a different gender and cleavage is covered - moreso than in the original Japanese version. 
 References to obscure Japanese food and culture are not edited and used in the English dub. 
 In the European Spanish dubbing despite having referred to Osiris as Slifer in the first series of Yu-Gi-Oh!, during this series they refer to the red bedroom as Osiris Rojo (Osiris Red) and the God as Osiris (in the scene in which Syrus/Sho is praying). 
 Trivia 
 With 180 episodes in total, this is the longest running spin-off series so far.
 With the  GX  anime being divided into four sub-seasons, it is also the spin-off series with the most seasons of its own plot. 
 Although this series does not introduce a new Extra Deck Summon method like most of the other spin-off series, it does focus on a specific type of Extra Deck Summoning (in this case,  Fusion ).
