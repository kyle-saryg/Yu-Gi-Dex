 " Hungry for a Duel ", known in Japan as " No More Holding Back! " is the eleventh episode of the  Yu-Gi-Oh! SEVENS  anime. It aired in Japan on August 15, 2020.
 Gavin  is determined to win the second Duel with his Neo Sogetsu Dueling Style. However, his opponent is  someone he could have never expected !
 
 Featured Duel: Gavin Sogetsu vs. Romin Kirishima 
 The Duel is conducted as a  Rush Duel .
 Turn 1: Gavin Gavin's hand contains " Scroll of Simultaneous Salutations ", " Greater Piercing!! ", " Fiendish Commander Yameruler ", " Binding Chain " and " Turtle Keeper of Traditions ". Gavin Normal Summons "Turtle Keeper of Traditions" (0/1400) and "Binding Chain" (1000/1100), then tributes them to Tribute Summon "Fiendish Commander Yameruler" (2500/2500). Gavin activates the effect of "Yameruler" as it was Normal Summoned this turn, letting him change its battle position to prevent both players from Tribute Summoning Level 7 or higher monsters until the end of Romin's next turn. "Yameruler" switches to Defense Position. Gavin Sets 2 cards. 
 Turn 2: Romin Romin's hand contains " Elechic Ampoule ", " Lullabind ", " Prima Guitarna of the Colorful Light ", " Elengel " and " Eleckiss ". Romin Sets 2 monsters, then Sets 2 cards.
 Turn 3: Gavin Since Gavin has no cards in his hand, he draws five cards. Gavin Normal Summons "Turtle Keeper of Traditions" (0/1400) and " Enshrined Deity Modorina " (800/500). He activates the effect of "Modorina", letting him return 1 face-up Level 7 or higher  Warrior  monster from his field to his hand. He returns "Yameruler", then tributes "Turtle Keeper of Traditions" and "Modorina" to Tribute Summon "Yameruler" (2500/2500) again. Gavin activates the effect of "Yameruler" as it was Normal Summoned this turn, letting him change its battle position to prevent both players from Tribute Summoning Level 7 or higher monsters until the end of Romin's next turn. "Yameruler" switches to Defense Position. Gavin then Normal Summons two copies of " Battle Commander Nandes " (1200/1000). He activates the effect of "Nandes", letting him change 1 face-up Warrior monster he controls from Defense Position to Attack Position. He switches "Yameruler" to Attack Position. Gavin activates his set Spell "Greater Piercing!!", letting him send 1 card from his hand to the GY to allow 2 monsters he controls with the same Level to inflict  piercing  damage this turn. He sends " Mountain Hermit Yur " to the GY and targets the 2 copies of "Nandes". 
 Both copies of "Nandes" attack and destroy Romin's 2 Set Monsters, which are revealed to be "Eleckiss" (300/1000) and "Elengel" (500/800) (Romin: 4000 → 3800 → 3400 LP). "Yameruler" attacks directly (Romin: 3400 → 900 LP).
 Turn 4: Romin Since Romin has one card in her hand, she draws four cards. Romin Normal Summons " Romance Pick " (500/0). Since she has less LP than Gavin, Romin activates the effect of "Romance Pick", paying 500 LP (Romin: 900 → 400 LP) to send the top 3 cards of her Deck to the GY, and if one of those is a  Psychic  monster then she can add a Psychic monster from her GY to her hand. She sends " Blue Medicine ", " 2-Block " and "Eleckiss" to the GY, then adds "Eleckiss" to her hand. Romin Normal Summons "Eleckiss" (300/1000) and "Elengel" (500/800). Since she controls 2 or more face-up Psychic monsters, Romin activates her set Spell "Lullabind", letting her change 1 face-up monster Gavin controls to face-down Defense Position. She targets "Yameruler", meaning that "Yameruler"'s effect no longer applies. Romin activates her set Spell "Elechic Ampoule"; letting her choose up to 2 face-up Level 2 or lower Psychic Normal Monsters and gain LP equal to the total ATK of the chosen monsters. She targets "Eleckiss" and "Elengel" (Romin: 400 → 1200 LP).
 Romin tributes "Eleckiss" and "Elengel" to Tribute Summon "Prima Guitarna of the Colorful Light" (2200/0). Romin Normal Summons another copy of Elengel (500/800), then tributes it along with "Romance Pick" to Tribute Summon " Esperaid of the Smashing Light " (2500/0). Romin activates the effect of "Prima Guitarna", paying 1000 LP (Romin: 1200 → 200 LP) to increase the ATK of her monsters by 300 for each monster Gavin controls ("Prima Guitarna": 2200 → 3100 ATK, "Esperaid" 2500 → 3400 ATK). Since her LP are 1000 or less, Romin activates the effect of "Esperaid", letting her destroy up to 2 monsters Gavin controls. She destroys "Yameruler" and a copy of "Nandes". "Prima Guitarna" attacks and destroys "Nandes" (Gavin: 4000 → 2100 LP). "Esperaid" attacks directly (Gavin: 2100 → 0 LP).
