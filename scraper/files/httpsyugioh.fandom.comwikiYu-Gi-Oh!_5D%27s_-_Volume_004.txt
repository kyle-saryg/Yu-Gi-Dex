 In New Domino City, the hottest game in town is the Turbo Duel, fought from blazingly fast motorcycles called Duel Runners. On the outskirts of New Domino City, in a district known as Satellite, a new Turbo Duel hero emerges—Yusei Fudo! On his custom-built Duel Runner, Yusei takes on all challengers, fighting for his friends and the future of Satellite! [1] 
 Synchro VS. Synchro!! 
 Yusei has defeated the twins Luna and Leo, but they promise him a rematch in Satellite city. On the way to Satellite, Yusei meets Rex Goodwin, who wants Yusei's help defeating the Skeleton Knight, and although Yusei doesn't trust this new ally. As the second round of the Grand Prix opens, the sinister Lazar presents the Duelists with a new challenge—face the 12 "Duel Zodiacs" and open the Duel Gate to advance to the final round! [2] 
 
 Story 
 New Domino City, in the year 20XX, Turbo Duels, fought from the seats of motorcycled-shaped duel disks called "Duel Runners," are the hottest game in town. 
 As the strongmen of the Dueling world slug it out, Yusei wins the second round of the D1 Grand Prix in style! Meanwhile, Sect acquires a Duel Dragon and has fallen into the darkness and disappeared along with the Skeleton Knight. Searching for a way to find Sect, Yusei begins a duel with Leo and Luna, twin Turbo duelists who both hold Duel Dragons! [2] 
 
 In the Next Volume… 
 Yusei fights to save his friend Sect from the clutches of the Skeleton Knight's curse. But can Yusei's loyalty overcome Sect's thirst for power?
