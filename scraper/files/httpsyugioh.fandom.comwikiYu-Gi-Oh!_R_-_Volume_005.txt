 Mr. Ito, thank you for all your hard work on "Yu-Gi-Oh! R". I'm very grateful that you continued in the "Yu-Gi-Oh!" tradition! I'll be looking forward to your original work next! Readers, please continue to support Mr. Ito in the future! [2] 
 
 Message from Akira Ito 
 This is the end of the "Tenma Uprising" storyline. This series ran for just under four years, and I'm very honored to have been a part of the "Yu-Gi-Oh" world for that time. Thank you for everyone who's supported me. [2]

 Story 
 When the tenth grader Yugi solved the ancient Egyptian Millennium Puzzle, another spirit took up residence in his body…Yu-Gi-Oh, the King of Games! Using his gaming skills, Yugi fought ruthless adversaries like Maximillion Pegasus, the multimillionaire creator of the collectible card game Duel Monsters, and Seto Kaiba, the teenager president of Kaiba Corporation. After winning the Battle City tournament, Yugi acquired the most powerful cards in the world: the three Egyptian God Cards "Slifer the Sky Dragon," "The God of the Obelisk" and "The Sun Dragon Ra", which were created by Pegasus based on a mysterious ancient Egyptian card game. 
 But now a new enemy has appeared: Yako Tenma, one of the group of duelists trained by Pegasus. To avenge his master's death, Yako kidnapped Ygu'is friend Anzu, intending to use her for the diabolical "R.A." Project… resurrecting Pegasus's spirit in Anzu's body! With the help of Yako's brother Gekko, Yugi and his friends fight their way through Pegasus's minions, but Yako's three Evil God Cards make him near impossible. Even Kaiba—Yugi's sometimes rival sometimes ally—falls to Yako. Can anyone stop Yako's madness, or will the Evil Gods reign over all? [2]
