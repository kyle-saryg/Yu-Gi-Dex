 Hecate  is a  series  of 3  monsters  appearing in the  Toei  Yu-Gi-Oh!  anime . Together they combine to form " Gorgon ". They also exist as cards in the  Bandai Carddass  and sticker cards in the  Bandai Sealdass . Each of them represents one of the aspects of the three-headed Greek goddess Hecate: the "crone" (" Red "), the "matron" (" Yellow ") and the "maiden" ( Violet ") while " Gorgon " represents Hecate itself.
 
 Anime appearance 
 Anzu Mazaki  got the card " Violet Hecate " after buying a pack of  Magic & Wizards  cards.  Yugi Mutou  told her how rare it was and Anzu let him keep it as a symbol of their friendship.
 Risa Kageyama  and her sisters stole the card from Yugi. When Yugi came to get it back, they took the  Millennium Puzzle  from him and forced him into a Duel. Without the puzzle,  Dark Yugi  was unable to come out.
 When Yugi was about to lose,  Seto Kaiba  stepped to finish the Duel in place of him. He let the sisters put "Violet Hecate" into their Deck for the Duel. They Summoned the 3 "Hecate" cards and used them to Summon " Gorgon ", which equally matched Kaiba's " Blue-Eyes White Dragon " in strength. Kaiba Summoned a second "Blue-Eyes White Dragon". Using both of them he was able to destroy "Gorgon" and defeat the sisters. He explained that he should be the one to defeat Yugi.
