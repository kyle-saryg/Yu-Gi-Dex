 "The Legendary Dragon"  is the third chapter of the  Yu-Gi-Oh! GX  manga . It was first printed in Japanese in the  V Jump  magazine on February 10, 2006 and in English in the  Shonen Jump  magazine. Both of which were printed in  volume 1  of the  Yu-Gi-Oh! GX  graphic novels afterwards.
 Though  Jaden  destroys  Chazz 's " Dragonic Knight ", Chazz had a counter strategy. Jaden defeats him using " Winged Kuriboh " and Chazz comes to realization about himself.
 
 Summary 
 Jaden  continues his  Duel  with  Chazz , impressed with Chazz's Summoning of " Dragonic Knight " on his first turn. Jaden Summons " Elemental Hero Terra Firma ", but Chazz  removes  it from the field using " Reverse-Time " and also depletes nearly all of Jaden's  Life Points . Chazz tells Jaden that  Duelists  should rely on their own strength, not their cards. Jaden replies that Duelists who stop caring for their cards are doomed, but Chazz remains unconvinced, thinking that he is facing a dilemma of fighting alone or with his partner.
 Jaden Summons " Winged Kuriboh ", and states that he trusts his card. Chazz says that cards are just tools, and plans on destroying "Winged Kuriboh", but Jaden uses " Transcendent Wings " to evolve Kuriboh to " Winged Kuriboh LV10 ", and uses its special ability to destroy all of Chazz's monsters and defeat him.
 After the Duel, Jaden believes that he saw a  dragon  watching the Duel. Chazz sees the dragon, and realizes that his "partner" was watching the Duel. Chazz realizes that he was afraid to lose with his partner, but now wants to Duel alongside him again.
 
 Featured Duel: Jaden Yuki vs. Chazz Princeton 
 Duel continues from  the previous chapter . 
 Turn 2: Chazz 
" Dragonic Knight " had just  destroyed  " Elemental Hero Stratos ", but  Jaden   activates  his  face-down  " Hero Signal ",  Special Summoning  " Elemental Hero Woodsman " (1000/2000) from his  Deck  as an  Elemental Hero  was just destroyed.  Chazz   Sets  a card.

He then activates " Premature Burial ",  paying  800  Life Points  (Jaden 3000 → 2200) to Special Summon "Stratos" (1800/300) from his  Graveyard  in Attack Position. He then activates the  effect  of "Terra Firma",  Tributing  "Stratos" to increase the  ATK  and  DEF  of "Terra Firma" by the ATK and DEF of the tributed monster ("Terra Firma": 2500 → 4300/2000 → 2300) until the  End Phase . "Terra Firma" attacks and destroys "Dragonic Knight" (Chazz 4000 → 2500), but Chazz activates his face-down " Reverse-Time ", resetting the  field  to how it was at the start of the  turn . "Dragonic Knight" (2800/2300), "Ocean" (1500/1200) and "Woodsman" (1000/2000) are all Special Summoned in Attack Position and "Terra Firma" is  banished .
