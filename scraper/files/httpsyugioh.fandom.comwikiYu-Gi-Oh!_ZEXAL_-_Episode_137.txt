 "' Clash of the Emperors ", known as " Vector's Trifling! Bonds of Trapped Friendship!! " in the Japanese version, is the one hundred and thirty-seventh episode of the  Yu-Gi-Oh! ZEXAL  anime. It first aired in Japan on January 19, 2014 and on Hulu on December 21, 2014.
 During his fated Duel with  Nash ,  Vector  learns about his true memories.  Don Thousand  has been toying with the memories of the  Seven Barian Emperors , including Vector's. In order to decide his own fate, Vector turns on Don Thousand, the root of all evil, and says something unexpected to Nash! At that time, Nash...
 
 Summary 
       Infant  Vector .     
 Nash  orders " Chaos Number 65: King Overfiend " to  attack  " Chaos Number 104: Umbral Horror Masquerade ". "King Overfiend" spins around before bisecting "Masquerade" with its scythe.  Vector  is thrown backwards, returning to his human form as his  Life Points  drop to 1000. Bright light covers the field as he hits the ground and wonders what this feeling he has is (these events are cut from the dub, as they took place in the previous episode; a new recap was done instead). Everyone present is able to view his true memories. At the castle that would one day become his  ruins , Vector's  father  and  mother  stand on a balcony, his mother holding him. A herald announces to the crowd that their prince Vector has been born on this fated day and claims he is an incarnation of their god as well as a symbol of peace. The crowd chants Vector's name, but his father mutters that peace is not something he wants (in the dub, Vector's kingdom is named Austrania, while the opposing kingdom is named Vandorn; Vector's father adds that Vector will not be a symbol of peace if their nation's resources are dwindling). Later, the infant Vector rests in a cradle and a glowing card descends through the window via the wind. It lands on him and the number  65  flashes out. 
 
       Vector's father  leading his army.     
 From his throne on his flagship, Vector's father orders his troops to snatch the riches and powers of their enemies by any means necessary. He persists that they must destroy anything that stands in their way and that they fight with everything they have. As he leads his troops in battle, he laughs maniacally (he does not laugh in the dub). Another day, Vector's father coughs violently and then collapses on the floor of the throne room. His servants rush to aid him.  By now, Vector is grown and his mother tells him his father can barely get out of bed. She begs Vector to save their country and people. Vector gently agrees. He announces his attentions to the populace from the balcony. He says he dislikes war and conflict and the desires to see the people of this land live in peace and happiness. He urges the people to work together with him to build a brighter tomorrow. The crowd cheers. 
 Later, Vector explains what he has done to his father, who drops his flask in shock. He demands to know what Vector is thinking, signing a peace treaty with their enemies. His father angrily calls him an idiot and insists that those neighboring countries were so close to becoming part of this kingdom. Vector emphatically tells him that he cannot bear to see any more people die on the battlefield. His father blunders towards him, disbelieving that a symbol of peace like Vector could have been sired by him. Vector just mutters "father..." (in the dub, Vector's father orders his son to invade the neighboring nation and take everything in their path, while Vector defies his father's instructions). Claiming he is an cursed child sent to drag his glory into the dirt (in the dub, Vector's father calls his son a disgrace to the kingdom, their people and to him, declares Vector unworthy to wield his sword and banishes him from the kingdom), Vector's father lunges for the sword holstered at Vector's side. Before the sword can hit Vector, his mother gets between them, being slashed down the back (Vector's mother being slashed is cut from the dub). She falls to her knees and tells his father that she won't allow their child to be harmed.
 
       Vector embraces his fate.     
 His father tells her to shut up, but then falls forward, succumbing to his illness and dying before his wife closes her eyes for good as well.  Don Thousand  appears behind Vector in his reaper form. Vector asks who he is and Thousand responds by telling him that he will become a mad prince, not a tragic prince. He assumes his regular form and tells Vector that the brutal, savage blood of his father will now run through him (in the dub, Thousand calls the peace that Vector sought an illusion and how it tore his family apart). A card flies towards Vector and embeds itself in his chest. Thousand urges him to awaken the power of ambition within in (in the dub, Thousand says Vector will trust no one but himself). Vector picks up the sword and now remembers having killed both of his parents. He asserts that he was born to turn the world into a never-ending bloodbath as he looks at his reflection in the sword's blade and his eyes glow red (in the dub, Vector promises to finish what his father started, conquering everything in his path and eliminating anyone who stood in his way).
 Tori  and  Yuma  remark that those were Vector's true memories, then.  Astral  adds that he was manipulated by Don Thousand, just as the other  Barian Emperors  were. As Vector slowly gets to his feet, he says this is impossible. If those were the memories of when he was a human, then it's a lie that he killed his own parents (in the dub, Vector is in denial that he himself hurt so many people). He yells Don Thousand's name and the god the  Barian World  appears before him. Thousand remarks he's figured it out (in the dub, Thousand says Vector became the person he was destined to become). Vector curses, and asks why Thousand lied. Thousand simply laughs (in the dub, Vector exclaims that Thousand manipulated him, while Thousand states that he also manipulated Vector's father). Yuma mutters Vector's name, while  Nash  silently stares. Vector screams in anguish and falls back to his knees. Yuma tells Don Thousand that Vector's heart and soul were broken because of him. He thinks it's natural that he'd have such feelings afterwards (Yuma addressing Thousand is cut from the dub). Yuma addresses Vector, telling him he used to be a nice person - he appeared in front of Yuma as Ray Shadows, after all. Yuma insists that Ray was Vector's true self. Vector mutters that Yuma may be right (in the dub, Vector doubts that he still has good in him, he also told Vector that they used to do stuff like burp the alphabet). Thousand tells Yuma that Vector was the ideal target - since he was so pure-hearted, the darkness born from killing his parents was much deeper than it would have been in anyone else (in the dub, Thousand chides Yuma for not understanding what really happened; Vector's desire for peace quieted his inner rage. That rage was there, but Thousand "helped" Vector awaken it). That is what made him such a powerful  Barian . 
 
         Vector holds  Don Thousand  back, urging  Nash  to finish him off.     
 Yuma yells that if Thousand hadn't interfered, Vector would have been a kind prince (in the dub, Yuma yells that Thousand didn't help Vector, he got into Vector's head and corrupted him). Thousand says that that may be true, but it does not change Vector's actions - those cannot be erased. Vector agrees with him - the crimes of his past are not washed away due to this. Yuma insists Vector can start over, with Tori agreeing. Vector thanks them both, but claims that he cannot have a future. Someone like him who has hurt so many people - or even just the few present - can never start anew. He  activates  his  face-down  " Xyz Discharge ", explaining that if Nash  sends  a card in his  hand  to the  Graveyard , this card will give  control  of every  Xyz Monster  he controls to Nash. Nash seems confused and Thousand asks what Vector is planning, calling him "boy". Vector tells them this is his way of trying to make up for everything. He urges Nash to strike him down with his own monsters - with the power of Don Thousand still inside him. Astral asks if he intends to take Thousand down with him (in the dub, Astral urges Nash not to hesitate), while Yuma yells for Vector to stop. Vector assures Yuma it's fine and says he deserves to be eliminated for what he did. Thousand yells Vector's name in shock (in the dub, Thousand yells that he can't let Vector do this), reaching towards him. Vector is engulfed in purple flames, which hold Thousand back. Thousand calls him impudent ("you ungrateful wretch!" in the dub) and Vector addresses Nash again, telling him to get rid of him and his sordid past. Thousand yells that he won't allow it and Vector says it must be done now, while he is still able to hold Thousand back. Nash nods and says he understands. Yuma yells "Shark!" 
 
         Vector's " Trick Buster ".     
 Nash sends the " Dream Shark " in his hand to the Graveyard and " Chaos Number 102: Archfiend Seraph " and " Chaos Number 103: Ragnafinity " vanish from Vector's field and appear on Nash's, on each side of "King Overfiend". Vector urges him once more to finish it. Yuma tries to stop him, but Vector himself insists that this is the only way. Nash begins to order an  attack , prompting Yuma to yell "STOP!" Nash finishes, telling "Ragnafinity" to attack  directly . "Ranganfinity" tosses its scythe as Yuma yells "VECTOR!!!!". Vector closes his eyes, but quickly reopens them, adopting a crazed look and yelling " TRAP  ACTIVATE!". He's activated his face-down " Trick Buster " as he controls no monsters and his opponent does. It will  negate  the attack and destroy all of his opponent's  Attack Position  monsters. A shield appears in front of him, off of which the scythe bounces. Everyone is present but Vector sighs. Three swords appear before Vector, which fly out and impale "Rangafinity", "King Overfiend" and "Archfiend Seraph", destroying them. Vector cackles that he cheated (in the dub, Vector exclaims that this was incredible). Yuma asks what he means. Vector thanks them all for falling for it and muses that that was his performance of a lifetime (in the dub, Vector also comments that he should be an actor for his performance). He calls them all idiots for believing it, hook line and sinker. He excitedly continues gloating before addressing Nash and saying he'll send him to where his friends went - after he takes care of a certain meddling "god". 
 
         Vector obliterates Don Thousand.     
 Thousand asks what he's talking about and Vector remarks that he noticed Thousand had tampered with his memories a long time ago (in the dub, Vector cuts his deal with Thousand and says he was the one manipulating the Barian deity the whole time). Tori asks if Vector planned to show all this to them. Vector calls it hilarious to see them all squirm and suffer (in the dub, Tori calls Vector the worst person she met, even worse than the worst person who ever lived; Vector responds that he's flattered by the comment, saying that he was already aware how amazing he is; Tori says Vector isn't). He adds that he's angry that Thousand toyed with his memories though. Thousand insists that Vector cannot raise a hand against him (in the dub, Vector calls his time with Thousand fun, but this is where they must part ways; Thousand says that Vector is nothing without him). Vector tells him to shut up and  Barian Battlemorphs  back to his new armored form. His eyes glow red and he declares that with the power he's absorbed from the other Emperors, he is stronger than Thousand. Thousand is engulfed in purple fire and screams in pain. He calls Vector foolish even as he remarks that he didn't think Vector's power was this great (in the dub, Thousand yells that Vector still needs him). Thousand dissolves and Vector laughs, while Astral cannot believe that he obliterated Don Thousand like that. Vector turns back to Nash and says he is next. He reveals that "Trick Buster" has another effect - for each monster destroyed, Nash will take 300  damage . (In the dub, Vector adds that he's sending Nash to "Doomsville") The Graveyard portal appears and from it emerge three beams of light, which move towards Nash. Yuma yells "Shark!", while Nash activates the effect of the "Dream Shark" in his Graveyard,  banishing  it to reduce the damage to 0 and  Special Summon  it in  Defense Position  The beams explode when they hit "Dream Shark". Vector is enraged that Nash didn't believe his act. Nash claims he threw away petty things like "belief" when he threw away his humanity and past memories (Nash does not mention this in the dub).
 
         " Chaos Number 5: Chaos Chimera Dragon " is Summoned.      Yuma mutters "Shark" while Nash Sets two cards to end his  turn . Vector tells Nash he won't forgive him for this and tells him to behold his true power (in the dub, Vector praises Nash for his intelligence; he would have liked him even more if Vector wasn't going to finish Nash off). He raises his arm and purple energy engulfs it before he  draws . Vector activates " Rank-Up-Magic Admiration of the Thousands ", which will let him Special Summon " Chaos Number " monsters from either players' Graveyard and give them a  Level  equal to their  Rank  +1. He Special Summons " Chaos Number 101: Silent Honor DARK " from Nash's Graveyard and "Umbral Horror Masquerade", "Archfiend Seraph" and "Ragnafinity" from his own. Now, "Admiration of the Thousands" will let him use them to Summon an Xyz Monster. He  overlays  his four Level 6 monsters and declares " Direct Chaos Xyz Evolution !". He chants "there are dead even in the chaotic world, Now rise from your graves in this world and let your souls become one!" (he does not chant in the dub) He Special Summons " Chaos Number 5: Chaos Chimera Dragon " in  Attack Position . Vector urges Nash to remember that this monster was made by using the power of  Chaos  he gained from Nash's friends (in the dub, Vector says that "Chaos Chimera Dragon" will dash Nash's remaining hopes of winning). It has 0  ATK  now, but Vector reveals that it gains 1000 ATK for each Overlay Unit it has, giving it 4000. 
 Vector activates the effect of "Chaos Chimera Dragon", explaining that it can only attack if he  detaches  an Overlay Unit first and the effect also banishes a  random  card in Nash's Deck. " Aqua Jet " flies from Nash's  D-Pad  before vanishing. Vector admits that this does mean it will lose 1000 ATK, but it will still be enough to defeat Nash. He orders "Chaos Chimera Dragon" to attack "Dream Shark" (in the dub, he adds that it was fun, but all good things must come to an end) and the dragon fires a rainbow beam from its chest. Nash activates the effect of "Dream Shark", which lets him decrease its  DEF  by 1000 once per turn to prevent its  destruction by battle . The attack rebounds off of a barrier, but Vector says he's not done and activates the effect of "Chaos Chimera Dragon" again. This time, " Big Jaws " is banished from Nash's Deck and the attack obliterates "Dream Shark". Nash specifies that the effect of "Dream Shark" causes it to be banished when it  leaves the field  (this is not mentioned in the dub). Vector laughs and remarks that all of Nash's monsters are gone now. He uses the effect again and this time " Zeus' Breath " is banished. He adds that the ATK of "Chaos Chimera Dragon" is halved when it attacks directly, but it's still enough. Vector quips that he's had a lot of fun, but Nash has become an eyesore now. Nash responds that he thinks the same of Vector (in the dub, Nash remarks that this is it, then). Vector declares his attack and insists it will end this time, saluting. 
 
         Nash's  banished  cards return.     
 Yuma yells "Shark", but Nash activates his face-down " Depth Gardna ". He explains that this card will reduce the  Battle Damage  to 0 and Special Summon itself as a Level 5 monster with ATK equal to the damage he would have taken. Vector's eyes narrow and he says he'll have to teach Nash another lesson then - as many as it will take (in the dub, Vector is irritated that Nash hasn't lost yet). He activates the other effect of "Chaos Chimera Dragon" - the cards that it banished are placed back on top of Nash's Deck. "Chaos Chimera Dragon" fires a green energy blast, which rips through the ground before Nash. The three cards fly up from the crevice and land in his D-Pad. Vector Sets a card and ends his turn (in the dub Vector says it was not like these three cards were useful).
 
         Nash's draw is sealed.     
 Nash wonders why he'd put the banished cards back on his Deck (in the dub, Nash thinks that the card are actually useful) and draws "Aqua Jet". Nash tells Vector he'll end this now - with the card he put back on his Deck. Vector reveals that he can't as the card Nash has drawn is shaded blue - any card banished by "Chaos Chimera Dragon" cannot be used at all for the remainder of the Duel. Astral says this is very bad - it means that Shark's next two draws are sealed too. Vector activates another effect of "Chaos Chimera Dragon". He can  pay  half his Life Points to re- attach  every Overlay Unit used last turn. "Chaos Chimera Dragon" fires another blast at the ground, from which emerge the three Overlay Units, returning its ATK to 4000. Yuma and Tori can't believe the situation will just repeat itself next turn (in the dub, they think that once Vector's turn comes, Nash will be finished for good). Vector cackles that it's over for real now (in the dub, he also asks if Nash has any last words). Nash responds that it's ironic - Vector has helped him this time.
 
         Nash prepares to  overlay  " Depth Gardna " and " Depth Biter ".     
 He activates " Infinity Tooth ", which lets him send a number of cards from the top of his Deck to the Graveyard equal to the number of Overlay Units his opponent's monsters have. He sends "Big Jaws", "Zeus' Breath", " Skull Kraken ", and " Surface " to the Graveyard. Vector remarks those were the cards he was forbidden from using. Now, Nash can draw a new card. He declares " Chaos Draw !" and the  Barian Emblem  radiates out from him. He  Normal Summons  the Level 5 " Depth Biter " without  Tribute  as his opponent controls an Xyz Monster. Nash overlays his two Level 5 monsters to Xyz Summon " Number 73: Abyss Splash ". He activates its effect, detaching an Overlay Unit to double its ATK. He orders "Abyss Splash" to attack "Chaos Chimera Dragon". Vector compliments the play, but activates his face-down " Overlay Burglary ", which lets him detach an Overlay Unit from Nash's monster and attach it to "Chaos Chimera Dragon". With that, the ATK of "Chaos Chimera Dragon" rises by another 1000. Vector calls it sad that Nash could have won, had he used both Overlay Units instead of one. Yuma remarks that as things stand now, Shark will lose (cut from the dub). 
 
         " Chaos Number 73: Abyss Supra Splash " is Summoned.     
 Vector declares that the battle will continue now - and Nash is finished. Nash counters that he has it backwards and activates his face-down " Rank-Up-Magic Quick Chaos ". Vector is shocked to see a  Quick-Play  " Rank-Up-Magic ". Nash explains it will  Rank-Up  "Abyss Splash" and infuse it with Chaos. He declares " Chaos Xyz Evolution " and chants "pierce through the whirlpool of Chaos, and now, surface from the depths to this land!" (he doesn't chant in the dub) He Special Summons " Chaos Number 73: Abyss Supra Splash " in Attack Position. Nash tells Vector that this card will bury him in the darkness. He orders an attack on "Chaos Chimera Dragon", prompting Vector to point out that it has only 3000 ATK. He quips that he'll help "Mr. Avenger" to his grave as he already has one foot in it. Nash activates the effect of "Abyss Supra Splash", detaching an Overlay Unit to increase its ATK by that of the monster it battles. Vector yells "WHAT!" and Nash declares that "Chaos Chimera Dragon" has 5000 ATK, so that is what "Abyss Supra Splash" gains. Vector says "8000 ATK" in disbelief. Nash asks that Vector's twisted soul fall into the deepest depths of darkness, where no light can reach (in the dub, Nash states that this attack is for himself and the other Emperors who Vector betrayed). Vector curses as the staff of "Abyss Supra Splash" crackles with electricity. Nash tells Vector to crumble to dust and blow away in the wind as "Abyss Supra Splash" fires a beam from its staff. "Chaos Chimera Dragon" is destroyed and Vector's Life Points fall to 0 as he reverts to his human form. He thinks that it's impossible that he could have lost as he hits the ground. Yuma, Astral and Tori gasp, while Nash simply stares.
 
 Featured Duel: Vector vs. Nash 
 Duel continues from  the previous episode. 
 
         " Dream Shark " blocks the  damage .     
 Turn 4: Nash 
" Chaos Number 65: King Overfiend " has just destroyed " Chaos Number 104: Umbral Horror Masquerade " in battle.  Vector   activates  his  face-down  " Xyz Discharge " to give  control  of " Chaos Number 103: Ragnafinity " and " Chaos Number 102: Archfiend Seraph " (both  Xyz Monsters ) to Nash by forcing Nash to send "Dream Shark" from his hand to the Graveyard. 
 "Ragnafinity" attacks  directly , but Vector activates his face-down " Trick Buster " to  negate  the attack and destroy all of Nash's  Attack Position   monsters  as Nash  declared  an attack while Vector controlled no monsters. "Trick Buster" then inflicts 300  damage  to Nash for each monster destroyed, but Nash activates the  effect  of " Dream Shark " to reduce the damage he would take to 0 and  Special Summon  it ( 5/0/2600) in  Defense Position . Nash  Sets  two cards.
 
         " Chaos Number 5: Chaos Chimera Dragon "  attacks .     
 Turn 5: Vector 
Vector  draws  " Rank-Up-Magic Admiration of the Thousands " and subsequently activates it to Special Summon any number of " Chaos Number " monsters with the same  Rank  from any Graveyard. Vector revives "Archfiend Seraph" ( 5/2900/2400), "Ragnafinity" ( 5/2800/2400), "Umbral Horror Masquerade" ( 5/3000/1500), and " Chaos Number 101: Silent Honor DARK " ( 5/2800/1500), all in Attack Position. The effect of "Rank-Up-Magic Admiration of the Thousands" then treats the summoned monsters as having a  Level  that is one higher than their Rank. 
 Through "Rank-Up-Magic Admiration of the Thousands", Vector  overlays  "Archfiend Seraph", "Ragnafinity", "Umbral Horror Masquerade", and "Silent Honor DARK" via  Chaos Xyz Evolution  in order to  Xyz Summon  " Chaos Number 5: Chaos Chimera Dragon " ( 6/0/0, ORU: 4) in Attack Position. Due to the second effect of "Chaos Chimera Dragon", its ATK becomes equal to the number of  Chaos Overlay Units  it has times 1000 ("Chaos Chimera Dragon": 0 → 4000 ATK). Vector activates the third effect of "Chaos Chimera Dragon" to  detach  a Chaos Overlay Unit ("Chaos Chimera Dragon": 4000 → 3000 ATK, 4 → 3 ORU),  banish  a random card from Nash's  Deck  (" Aqua Jet ") and allow "Chaos Chimera Dragon" to attack. 
 "Chaos Chimera Dragon" attacks "Dream Shark", but Nash activates the effect of "Dream Shark" to decrease its  DEF  by 1000 ("Dream Shark": 2600 → 1600 DEF) once per  turn  in order to prevent its destruction. Vector activates the third effect of "Chaos Chimera Dragon" ("Chaos Chimera Dragon": 3000 → 2000 ATK, 3 → 2 ORU) and " Big Jaws " is banished from Nash's Deck. "Chaos Chimera Dragon" attacks and destroys "Dream Shark", which is banished by its second effect as it  left the field . 
 Vector activates the third effect of "Chaos Chimera Dragon" ("Chaos Chimera Dragon": 2000 → 1000 ATK, 2 → 1 ORU) and " Zeus' Breath " is banished from Nash's Deck. "Chaos Chimera Dragon" attacks directly and its fourth effect halves its ATK during damage calculation only ("Chao Chimera Dragon": 1000 → 500 ATK) since it's attacking directly. Nash activates his face-down " Depth Gardna " to reduce the  battle damage  to 0 and Special Summon "Depth Gardna" in Attack Position with its ATK and DEF becoming equal to the damage Nash would have taken ( 5/500/500). At the end of the Battle Phase, Vector activates the fifth effect of "Chaos Chimera Dragon" to  return  the cards banished by its effect during this  Battle Phase  to the top of Nash's Deck, but they cannot be used for the rest of the  Duel . Vector Sets a card.
 Turn 6: Nash 
Nash draws "Aqua Jet". Vector activates the seventh effect of "Chaos Chimera Dragon" to  pay  half his  Life Points  (Vector: 1000 → 500 LP) and re- attach  all Chaos Overlay Units used in the previous turn from the Graveyard to "Chaos Chimera Dragon" ("Chaos Chimera Dragon": 1000 → 4000 ATK, 1 → 4 ORU). Nash activates " Infinity Tooth " to send four cards from the top of his Deck to the Graveyard (one for each Overlay Unit attached to "Chaos Chimera Dragon") and draw a card. Nash sends "Big Jaws", "Zeus' Breath", " Skull Kraken " and " Surface " to the Graveyard and performs a  Chaos Draw . Nash  Normal Summons  " Depth Biter " ( 5/1800/1000) in Attack Position without  Tribute  via its own effect as Vector controls an Xyz Monster. Nash overlays "Depth Gardna" and "Depth Biter" in order to  Xyz Summon  " Number 73: Abyss Splash " ( 5/2400/1400, ORU: 2) in Attack Position.
 
         " Chaos Number 73: Abyss Supra Splash " strikes the core of "Chaos Chimera Dragon".     
 Nash activates the effect of "Abyss Splash" to detach an Overlay Unit ("Abyss Splash": 2 → 1 ORU) and double its ATK ("Abyss Splash": 2400 → 4800 ATK) until the end of the Battle Phase. "Abyss Splash" attacks "Chaos Chimera Dragon", but Vector activates his face-down  " Overlay Burglary " to detach the last Overlay Unit from "Abyss Splash" ("Abyss Splash": 1 → 0 ORU) and attach it to "Chaos Chimera Dragon" ("Chaos Chimera Dragon": 4000 → 5000 ATK, 4 → 5 ORU). Nash activates his face-down " Rank-Up-Magic Quick Chaos " to Rank-Up "Abyss Splash" via  Chaos Xyz Evolution  in order to Xyz Summon " Chaos Number 73: Abyss Supra Splash " ( 6/3000/2000, ORU: 2) in Attack Position. "Abyss Supra Splash" attacks "Chaos Chimera Dragon" and Nash activates the effect of "Abyss Supra Splash" to detach a Chaos Overlay Unit ("Abyss Supra Splash": 2 → 1 ORU) and increase its ATK by that of "Chaos Chimera Dragon" ("Abyss Supra Splash": 3000 → 8000 ATK). "Abyss Supra Splash" then destroys "Chaos Chimera Dragon" (Vector: 500 → 0 LP).
