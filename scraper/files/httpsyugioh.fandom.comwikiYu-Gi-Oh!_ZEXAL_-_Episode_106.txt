 Summary 
       The difference between the ATK of " Soul Drain Dragon " and " Galaxy-Eyes Photon Dragon ".     
 As the Duel between  Kite  and  Jinlon  continues,  Shark  notes that things are looking bad for Kite.  Astral  continues that the  ATK  of " Soul Drain Dragon " is 8000. If it attacks " Galaxy-Eyes Photon Dragon ", Kite will lose. If Kite destroys "Drain Dragon", its effect will inflict damage to Kite equal to half its ATK, also causing him to lose. Yuma adds that if this goes on, there is nothing left for Kite to get a safe footing on. Jinlon asks Kite on what he will do next; Kite urges Jinlon to get on with it. Jinlon tells Kite to relax, as "Drain Dragon" cannot attack during the turn it was Summoned, surprising Shark and Yuma. He ends his turn and remarks that Kite managed to escape defeat (in the dub, Jinlon urges Kite to take his turn because he is intrigued on what he will do next. He also compares a stalling Kite to a chick too scared to leave its nest). Kite asks if Jinlon is mocking him (in the dub, Kite says the sooner he goes, the sooner Jinlon will lose). The Number Guardian tells Kite not to get the wrong idea because this is a trial, a wall standing in his way. He wants to see how Kite will overcome it. If Kite does not overcome the wall, he will be swallowed by it (in the dub, Jinlon says Kite is doing well in his tests so far, but the next one may change all of that, and how Kite will overcome it may be decided on the next move).
 
Kite tells Jinlon to stop joking and begins his turn. Yuma says Kite managed to survive the last turn (in the dub, Yuma cheers Kite on) and Astral continues that if Kite does not turn things around this turn, he will lose. Jinlon asks Kite what's going on and Kite activates the  Spell Card , " Desperate Maneuver ", paying 800  Life Points  to halve the  original ATK  of an opponent's monster. He targets "Drain Dragon" and a bolt of red electricity strikes it on the chest, reducing its ATK from 8000 to 6000 and causing the monster itself to shrink. As Kite's Life Points were reduced, its ATK goes down further to 5200. Yuma is surprised that Kite sacrificed his Life Points to reduce the ATK of Jinlon's monster. Jinlon says "Drain Dragon" still has 5200 ATK, meaning "Galaxy-Eyes" still isn't enough to overcome it. Kite activates " Dragonic Divine ", paying 1000 Life Points to add the top-most Spell Card from his  Graveyard  to his  hand  as he  controls  a  Level  8 or higher  Dragon - Type  monster. "Galaxy-Eyes" fires a purple beam from its mouth at the ground, creating a Graveyard portal and returning "Desperate Manuever" to Kite's hand. This reduces the ATK of "Drain Dragon" to 4200. Yuma notes that Kite sacrificed his Life Points again, but Astral replies that this is expected of Kite - he instantly comes up with countermeasures. Yuma asks what he means because Kite currently has 2200 Life Points left (in the dub, Yuma's first line at this point is cut and Astral says Kite is reducing his Life Points to reduce the ATK of "Drain Dragon"; Yuma says this is risky). This time, Shark answers Yuma's question; after this, Kite will have no more than 200 Life Points remaining (in the dub, Shark says he does not like where this Duel is going). Kite activates "Desperate Scrape" again, paying 800 more Life Points to reduce the ATK of "Drain Dragon" from 4200 to 2400. Yuma exclaims that "Galaxy-Eyes" is now the stronger monster. Kite orders "Galaxy-Eyes" to attack "Drain Dragon" with " Photon Stream of Destruction ". "Drain Dragon" is destroyed in the attack, but a spectral version of it appears for a brief moment before vanishing. This reduces Jinlon's Life Points to 3400 as he mutters, "My Life..." (in the dub, Jinlon yells at Kite to show an old man some mercy). Yuma is happy that Kite destroyed Jinlon's monster, but Jinlon activates the other effect of "Drain Dragon", inflicting damage to Kite equal to half its original ATK.       Kite throwback by the flame of "Soul Drain Dragon".      A fiery version of "Drain Dragon" emerges from a Graveyard portal and it flies towards Kite, engulfing him in flames and throwing him back, reducing his Life Points to 200. Yuma mutters that Kite only has 200 Life Points left. Shark says he knew this back then and Astral continues that this was the only way for Kite to defeat the 8000 ATK "Drain Dragon"; Shark agrees. Yuma is frustrated because he was the only one who did not know about this until now. Astral tells him not to worry; he and Shark already knew that Yuma did not know what they knew. Yuma snaps at Astral to shut up because he already knew at least one thing. Astral asks what that thing is and Yuma replies that Kite will win. Astral points out that Kite only has 200 Life Points left. Jinlon says now that " Number 46: Dragluon " is the only Dragon-Type monster he currently controls, it will reappear, and it does so. Kite activates the  Trap Card , " Destruction Reward ", as his opponent's monster was destroyed. As he destroyed a Level 8 monster, he draws two cards. Kite  Sets  two cards and ends his turn. Jinlon praises Kite for overcoming the test of "Drain Dragon", but adds that he has one more wall to overcome: "Dragluon". He takes the next turn and activates the last effect of "Dragluon": if "Dragluon" has no  Overlay Units  left and is the only Dragon-Type monster Jinlon controls, Jinlon can gain control over an opponent's Dragon-Type monster. He targets Kite's "Galaxy-Eyes", calling it Kite's soul. He also adds that Kite can negate the effect by paying half his Life Points, and if he does, "Galaxy-Eyes" will be destroyed. Kite is frustrated on what to do next, while his friends are shocked.
Below the ruins,  Mizar  makes several leaps on the mountain. He mutters that he can't use his  Barian  powers while on the mountain and wonders what's with it. Suddenly, a feeling goes through Mizar and he asks himself what that was. Back at the Duel, Yuma wonders what Kite will do with "Galaxy-Eyes" (Yuma's line is cut from the dub). Jinlon says Kite should know best about the power of "Galaxy-Eyes": will Kite destroy it with his own hands or surrender it to Jinlon? Kite replies that Jinlon doesn't understand the strength of his bond with "Galaxy-Eyes"; there won't be a "Galaxy-Eyes" without Kite himself and no Kite without "Galaxy-Eyes". Therefore, it is impossible for Kite to destroy his monster.       " Dragluon " take controls of "Galaxy-Eyes".      Jinlon commands "Dragluon" to take "Galaxy-Eyes" then, as the wings of "Dragluon" spread out and "Dragluon" is surrounded in a gold aura. It releases a wave of green energy, causing "Galaxy-Eyes" to disappear from Kite's field and reappear on Jinlon's, having regained its neon blue colors. Yuma exclaims that "Galaxy-Eyes" is now Kite's enemy. Jinlon says he will finish off Kite with his own monster as an act of sympathy. He commands "Galaxy-Eyes" to attack Kite directly. Shark mutters Kite's name and Astral asks what Kite will do. Yuma yells Kite's name, (in the dub, Shark mutters this isn't good, Astral says this is the end, and Yuma yells that "Galaxy-Eyes" is attacking) but Kite activates the  Continuous Trap Card , " Destiny Break ". When an opponent's monster attacks Kite directly, he can draw a card and reveal it. If it was a monster, the attack will be negated; otherwise it is sent to the Graveyard. Kite draws " Galaxy Knight ", as the card glows with a blue light and surrounds Kite in a force field, negating the attack.         Jinlon chides Kite for relying on luck.      Jinlon chides Kite for relying on luck during the Duel, but Kite insists that it was not luck, but predetermined events. Jinlon asks what Kite means and he replies that the best Duelist will even lead the cards he wants to draw. This is the bond between him and "Galaxy-Eyes" (in the dub, Kite says this is why he is a Dueling champ, while Jinlon is a Dueling chump). Jinlon says he can still attack with "Dragluon". He orders it to attack directly with " Divine Fire Attack " as "Dragluon" releases a stream of green energy surrounded by a fiery vortex from its mouth at Kite. Kite activates the effect of "Destiny Break" again to try to negate the attack. He draws another copy of "Galaxy Knight", negating the attack of "Dragluon". Jinlon exclaims, "Impossible!" Kite activates the other effect of "Destiny Break", destroying it to Special Summon any monsters that were drawn by its effect. He Special Summons both copies of "Galaxy Knight" in Attack Position. Jinlon Sets a card and ends his turn.
         " Neo Galaxy-Eyes Photon Dragon " appears.     
Yuma says Kite managed to survive Jinlon's attacks. Astral says right now, there is nothing Kite can do (in the dub, Astral replies that Kite has to do more than that in order to win). Still determined to win, Kite begins his turn. He smirks, satisfied with his draw, to Jinlon's surprise. Kite activates " Destiny Overlay ", allowing him to  Xyz Summon  using monsters from either side of the field. Jinlon and Yuma are shocked by this. Kite  overlays  his two "Galaxy Knights" and Jinlon's "Galaxy-Eyes" to Xyz Summon " Neo Galaxy-Eyes Photon Dragon ". On the mountain's base,  Tori  wonders what is happening on top of the mountain, as they see red lightning up ahead.  Rio  replies that this is a noble dragon's roar. There are two dragons fighting up there (in the dub, Rio agrees with Tori; whatever is going on up there may not be too good). Meanwhile, Jinlon repeats, "Neo Galaxy-Eyes Photon Dragon" and says Kite managed to take his monster back and evolve it. Yuma exclaims that "Neo Galaxy-Eyes" can activate its effect, but Astral says "no". Jinlon asks if Kite has forgotten, as he reiterates the second effect of "Dragluon": it negates the effects of all opposing Dragon-Type monsters. "Neo Galaxy-Eyes" roars, as its neon red color is drained away. Yuma exclaims that "Neo Galaxy-Eyes" was sealed and Astral continues that as a " Number ", "Dragluon" cannot be destroyed by battle with non-"Number" monsters. Jinlon chuckles and says that during the next turn, he can gain control of "Neo Galaxy-Eyes" (in the dub, this effect of the "Numbers" is not mentioned). Yuma asks Astral if this means Kite must win this turn, but Kite yells at him to be quiet and just watch. Yuma starts to protest, but Kite replies that his victory is already decided. He activates the effect of " Overlay Sentinel " in his Graveyard, banishing it to have an opponent's monster lose 500 ATK for each Overlay Unit "Neo Galaxy-Eyes" has; since it has three, "Dragluon" loses 1500 ATK total. The Overlay Units stop orbiting "Neo Galaxy-Eyes" and they bombard "Dragluon" with bursts of light, reducing its ATK to 1500. Kite then activates the effect of " Overlay Booster " in his Graveyard, banishing it to have "Neo Galaxy-Eyes" gain 500 ATK for each of its Overlay Units; since it has three, it gains 1500 ATK, bringing it to 6000 ATK. Jinlon exclaims, "What?!" and Yuma cheers that Kite did it. Kite declares an attack on "Dragluon" with "Neo Galaxy-Eyes", but Jinlon activates the Trap Card, " Dragon Dance ". When a Dragon-Type Xyz monster is attacked, Jinlon can banish two Dragon-Type monsters from his Graveyard and have the attacking monster lose ATK equal to the total ATK of the banished monsters. He banishes " Armed Protector Dragon " and "Soul Drain Dragon". They emerge from a Gravyeard portal and surround "Neo Galaxy-Eyes", as Jinlon continues that their total ATK is 6000, meaning that the ATK of "Neo Galaxy-Eyes" will be reduced to 0. Yuma repeats the value in astonishment; Shark says this is bad. Jinlon says Kite cannot stop this attack and orders "Dragluon" to counterattack. He bids farewell to Kite, but Kite says Jinlon will be going down. He activates the  Counter Trap Card , " Galaxy Dragon Maelstrom ". When two Dragon-Type Xyz Monsters battle, Kite can negate the activation of a Trap Card and destroy it. "Drain Dragon" and "Armed Protector Dragon" disappear and "Neo Galaxy-Eyes" shatters the bonds surrounding it, regaining its ATK. Jinlon repeats, "Impossible", and Kite says he never underestimated Jinlon. With his vast knowledge of Dragons, Jinlon tormented Kite with his skills, which brought out the best in the latter (in the dub, Kite says he saw Jinlon's move coming long ago and Jinlon's strategies made one thing clear: he always had a trick up his sleeve).         "Dragluon" is destroyed.      To honor him, Kite had Set that card. Jinlon mutters Kite's name (in the dub, Jinlon says Kite is a quick learner). Kite tells Jinlon to take the blow from him and "Neo Galaxy-Eyes" as he declares, " Ultimate Photon Stream of Destruction ". "Dragluon" is engulfed in several explosions (while one explosion was left in the dub, the others were cut) and Jinlon is knocked back, but he manages to land on his feet, as his Life Points are reduced to 0. Yuma leaps up and exclaims that Kite did it. Kite undoes  Photon Transformation  and Jinlon's D-Pad transforms back into his walking stick. Jinlon congratulates Kite for overcoming it. Kite asks him why he tested him like that. Jinlon decides to tell Kite about the ruins' legend before answering Kite's question. Kite realizes that this is Mizar's legend and Jinlon confirms it.
         Mizar in his past life, with his dragon.     
 Long ago, this land was protected by a dragon and Mizar, the hero of the legend. They were able to truly understand each other's hearts, making them good friends. They were also allies who fought alongside each other in Duels. Due to Mizar's and the dragon's combined efforts, the days were calm and peaceful. One year, a terrible disaster struck the land, killing many innocent people. A wandering shaman appeared and blamed the dragon for bringing the disaster to the land. The deception was successful and the villagers began to hate Mizar and the dragon and decided to bring them down. Mizar desperately tried to plead to the villagers that this was not the dragon's fault, but his words never reached them. The villagers continued to protest that if Mizar was a true hero, he would have slain the dragon. Mizar made up his mind and asked the villagers that if he killed himself, would they believe him? At this moment, many arrows from the opposing land, who had been waiting for this very moment to invade the country, struck down Mizar and the dragon, killing them. The wandering shaman had been a spy for the opposing country the whole time and the land was conquered (in the dub, Mizar betrayed the dragon and slayed it alongside the villagers). After finishing the legend, Jinlon acknowledges Kite for refusing to give up the power to decide his own fate, despite the trials he faced. He, on the other hand, gave up his life, unlike Mizar (in the dub, Jinlon tested Kite because he wanted to see if he would follow his heart, unlike Mizar). 
 
Behind Jinlon, Mizar yells at him to shut up. The group turns to find Mizar standing on a roof. Kite and Jinlon recognize him. Mizar leaps from the roof and walks toward Jinlon. Jinlon stutters that Mizar can't be back. However, he can feel the past Mizar in his soul (in the dub, Jinlon says his form may be different, but he was the being that Mizar should have known for all these years). Mizar yells at Jinlon to stop joking, as he raises his palm in front of him and releases shock waves from it, knocking the Number Guardian back. Mizar tells him to stop this nonsense that he was related to these lowly humans. Yuma curses at Mizar for what he did, but Kite tells him to hold on because he is Mizar's opponent. The spirit of "Neo Galaxy-Eyes" appears behind him and Mizar smirks and calls this interesting, as the spirit of " Number C107: Neo Galaxy-Eyes Tachyon Dragon " appears behind him. He adds this is the perfect time to settle things. Yuma mutters Kite's name; suddenly, the ruins start to shake. Even Rio and Tori can sense it from the bottom of the mountain. Rio pushes Tori out of the way of a boulder coming down, while  Orbital 7  manages to run away from it. Back in the crumbling ruins, Mizar decides to retreat and settle this another time as he vanishes into a portal. Kite mutters Mizar's name and Yuma asks what's going on. Everyone is surrounded by a cloud of dust. When it clears, Yuma and his friends discover that the ruins and Jinlon aren't there anymore. Yuma finds another  King's Coin  on a boulder. He suddenly hears a voice. The voice says the legend still continues. The dragon's soul was touched by the "Numbers" and was revived.         Jinlon tells Kite of Astral's legend.      He continued protecting this place up to this day. Jinlon, in his true dragon form, emerges from the clouds (in the dub, Jinlon adds that as a dragon, his name was "Dragluon"; as a human, he took the name "Jinlon"). He admits that it is true that he tested Kite and continues that when those seeking the "Numbers" of the ruins appear, a great change will happen to this world (in the dub, Jinlon says when Duelists win a Duel with a "Mythyrian Number" at stake, they will gain great power; he deems Kite worthy of the "Number"). He also entrusts Kite with the task of leading the world down the right path. Kite repeats "the right path". Jinlon says he saw something once: far away, two divine lights were flashing in the sky. Astral suddenly recalls the memory of the battle he had with  Don Thousand . Jinlon continues that the battle lasted for many days.         Kite receives "Number 46".      Rains of fire poured down to the ground as lighting ripped through the Earth. Then the lights finally collided and vanished. Astral asks if what Jinlon said was really his memory of fighting the Barians. Jinlon glows with a gold aura, as he says he will entrust his "Number" to Kite. He vanishes and his card floats down to Kite, allowing him to take it. Jinlon continues that the battle led to the planet's ruin once, and that it must not happen again.
 Back in the  Different Dimension Airship , Astral stands in front of the "Numbers" he gathered. He muses that he remembers his mission: to destroy the Barian World.
 
 Featured Duel: Kite Tenjo vs. Jinlon 
 Duel continues from  the previous episode . 
 Turn 4: Kite 
 
         Kite   activates  " Desperate Maneuver ".     
 Kite  draws. He then  activates  " Desperate Maneuver " to  pay  800  Life Points  (Kite: 4000 → 3200 LP) and halve the  original ATK  of " Soul Drain Dragon " ("Soul Drain Dragon": 8000 → 6000 → 5200 ATK). Kite then activates " Dragonic Divine " to pay 1000 Life Points (Kite: 3200 → 2200 LP) and add "Desperate Maneuver" from his Graveyard to his hand ("Soul Drain Dragon": 5200 → 4200 ATK). He then activates "Desperate Maneuver" again (Kite: 2200 → 1400 LP) ("Soul Drain Dragon": 4200 → 3400 → 2400 ATK). 
 " Galaxy-Eyes Photon Dragon "  attacks  and  destroys  "Soul Drain Dragon" (Jinlon: 4000 → 3400 LP). The final  effect  of "Soul Drain Dragon" activates (Kite: 1400 → 200 LP). Kite activates his  face-down  " Destruction Reward " to  draw  two cards as an opponent's  Level  7 or higher monster was destroyed. Kite  Sets  two cards.
 Turn 5: Jinlon 
 
         Kite activates " Destiny Break ".     
 Jinlon's hand contains " The Flute of Summoning Dragon " and " Dragon's Rebirth ". Jinlon draws. As " Number 46: Dragluon " is the only  Dragon - Type  monster  Jinlon   controls  and it has no  Overlay Units , Jinlon activates the final effect of "Dragluon" to take control of "Galaxy-Eyes Photon Dragon" (an opponent's Dragon-Type monster) though Kite has the choice of paying his Life Points to destroy "Galaxy-Eyes Photon Dragon". Kite chooses not to destroy "Galaxy-Eyes Photon Dragon" 
 "Galaxy-Eyes Photon Dragon" attacks  directly , but Kite activates his face-down " Destiny Break " (as it is his opponent's  Battle Phase ) to draw a card and  reveal  it. If it is a monster, the attack is  negated , but if it is not, the drawn card is  sent  to the Graveyard. Kite reveals " Galaxy Knight ", so the attack is negated. "Dragluon" attacks directly, but Kite activates the effect of "Destiny Break" to draw a card. Kite reveals another "Galaxy Knight", so the attack is negated. At the end of the Battle Phase, the final effect of "Destiny Break" destroys itself, and Kite  Special Summons  his two "Galaxy Knights" ( 8/2000/2600 each) in  Attack Position  with their effects negated (as they were the monsters he revealed with "Destiny Break"). Jinlon Sets a card.
 Turn 6: Kite 
 
         Kite activates " Destiny Overlay ".     
 Kite draws. He then activates " Destiny Overlay " to target "Galaxy-Eyes Photon Dragon" and his two "Galaxy Knights" in order to allow himself to immediately use the targeted monsters for an  Xyz Summon . Kite  overlays  "Galaxy-Eyes Photon Dragon" and his two "Galaxy Knights" in order to Xyz Summon " Neo Galaxy-Eyes Photon Dragon " ( 8/4500/3000, ORU: 3) in Attack Position. The second effect of "Dragluon" then applies to "Neo Galaxy-Eyes Photon Dragon". 
 Kite activates the effect of " Overlay Sentinel " to  banish  it from his  Graveyard  and reduce the ATK of "Dragluon" by 500 for each Overlay Unit  attached  to "Neo Galaxy-Eyes Photon Dragon" ("Dragluon": 3000 → 1500 ATK). Kite activates the effect of " Overlay Booster " to banish it from his Graveyard and increase the ATK of "Neo Galaxy-Eyes" by 500 for each Overlay Unit attached to it ("Neo Galaxy-Eyes Photon Dragon": 4500 → 6000 ATK). 
 
"Neo Galaxy-Eyes Photon Dragon" attacks "Dragluon", but Jinlon activates his face-down " Dragon Dance " to banish " Armed Protector Dragon " and "Soul Drain Dragon" (which are both Dragon-type monsters) from his Graveyard and decrease the ATK of "Neo Galaxy-Eyes Photon Dragon" by that of the banished monsters. Kite activates his face-down " Galaxy Dragon Maelstrom " (as a Dragon-Type Xyz Monster is  battling  and his opponent activated a  Spell / Trap Card ) to negate and destroy "Dragon Dance" and negate the effects of all monsters Jinlon controls.          Jinlon is defeated      "Neo Galaxy-Eyes Photon Dragon" then destroys "Dragluon" (Jinlon: 3400 → 0 LP).
