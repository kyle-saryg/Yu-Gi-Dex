" My Brother's Keeper ", known as " True Tears " in the Japanese version, is the eighty-fifth episode of  Yu-Gi-Oh! VRAINS  anime. It aired in Japan on January 16, 2019. It aired in English on Teletoon on September 20, 2020.
 Playmaker  and his allies head to Mirror  LINK VRAINS  to confront  Lightning . On the other hand,  Harlin  blocks  Blue Maiden's  path and begins a  Duel  against her.
 
 Featured Duel: Blue Maiden vs. Harlin 
         
 The Duel is conducted as a  Speed Duel .
 Turn 1: Harlin 
As there are no monsters in the  Main Monster Zones , Harlin  Special Summons  " Hydradrive Booster " (0/0) from his hand via its own effect. Harlin uses "Hydradrive Booster" to  Link Summon  " Coolant Hydradrive " (1000/LINK-1/↓) to the  Extra Monster Zone . Harlin activates the Spell Card " Hydradrive Rebuild ", destroying a face-up " Hydradrive " monster he controls. He destroys "Coolant Hydradrive", whose effect Special Summons a " Hydradrive Token " (0/0) in Defense Position since it was destroyed by battle or card effect. Because the monster destroyed by its effect activated its effect in the  GY , Harlin activates the other effect of "Hydradrive Rebuild" to Special Summon "Coolant Hydradrive" back from the GY. Harlin activates the Spell Card " Hydradrive Utilization ", paying 500 LP (Harlin: 4000 → 3500 LP) to banish a "Hydradrive" monster from his GY and add a monster with the same name from his Deck to his hand. He banishes "Hydradrive Booster" and adds a second copy from his Deck to his hand.   
 As his LP is 4000 or lower, Harlin activates his  Skill  "Marker's Portal", letting him activate a  Link Spell Card  from his Deck. Harlin activates " Judgment Arrows " (↖↑↗) from his deck, which cannot be negated or destroyed by the opponent's effects due to the effect of "Marker's Portal". Harlin Normal Summons "Hydradrive Booster" (0/0), then uses "Hydradrive Booster" to Link Summon another "Coolant Hydradrive" to the Extra Monster Zone. Harlin then uses "Hydradrive Token" to Link Summon " Flow Hydradrive " (1000/↓). He then uses "Flow Hydradrive" and a "Coolant Hydradrive" to Link Summon " Twin Hydradrive Knight " (1800/LINK-2/←→) to the zone a Link Arrow of "Judgment Arrows" points to. As "Twin Hydradrive Knight" was Link Summoned, Harlin activates its effect to change its  Attribute  to that of the original Attributes of the Link Monsters used for its Link Summon, in this case both  WIND  and  WATER . As long as "Twin Hydradrive Knight" is on the field, monsters with the same Attribute as it have their effects negated. Harlin  sets  a card.
 Turn 2: Blue Maiden 
Blue Maiden Normal Summons " Marincess Sea Horse " (1400/1000). She uses "Sea Horse" to Link Summon " Marincess Blue Slug " (1500/LINK-1/↓) to the Extra Monster Zone. Blue Maiden then Special Summons another "Marincess Sea Horse" next to the Link Arrrow of "Blue Slug" Link Arrow due to its own effect. She uses "Sea Horse" and "Blue Slug" to Link Summon " Marincess Coral Anemone " (2000/LINK-2/←↓). Blue Maiden sets a card and activates the effect of " Marincess Sea Star " in her hand, sending it to the GY to increase the ATK of "Coral Anemone" by 800 ("Coral Anemone": 2000 → 2800 ATK). 
 "Coral Anemone" attacks "Coolant Hydradrive". Since a Link Monster it points to is battling, the effect of "Judgment Arrows" doubles the ATK of that monster during damage calculation ("Coolant Hydradrive": 1000 → 2000 ATK). The attack continues and "Coolant Hydradrive" is destroyed (Harlin: 3500 → 2700 LP). Because it was destroyed by battle or card effect, the effect of "Coolant Hydradrive" Special Summons a "Hydradrive Token" in Defense Position. 
 Turn 3: Harlin 
Harlin uses "Hydradrive Token" to Link Summon another "Coolant Hydradrive". He  equips  "Coolant Hydradrive" with the  Equip Spell Card  " Hydradrive Impact ". Due to the effect of "Hydradrive Impact"; all battle damage the equipped monster inflicts is doubled, but the equipped monster must attack if able. Because Blue Maiden controls a WATER monster, the effect of "Coolant Hydradrive" lets it attack  directly .
 "Coolant Hydradrive" attacks directly, but Blue Maiden activates her set  Trap Card  " Marincess Wave ", negating the effect of "Coolant Hydradrive". Due to the effect of "Hydradrive Impact"; "Coolant Hydradrive" must attack, so it attacks "Coral Anemone" with the effect of "Judgment Arrows" doubling its ATK during damage calculation ("Coolant Hydradrive": 1000 → 2000 ATK). The attack fails and "Coral Anemone" destroys "Coolant Hydradrive" (Harlin: 2700 → 1900 LP). Because it was destroyed by battle or card effect, the effect of "Coolant Hydradrive" Special Summons a "Hydradrive Token" in Defense Position. "Twin Hydradrive Knight" attacks "Coral Anemone", with the effect of "Judgment Arrows" doubling its ATK during damage calculation ("Twin Hydradrive Knight": 1800 → 3600 ATK). "Coral Anemone" is destroyed (Blue Maiden: 4000 → 3200 LP). Because "Coral Anemone" was sent to the GY, its effect lets Blue Maiden return a "Marincess" card from her GY to her hand. She adds "Marincess Wave" to her hand. 
 Harlin activates his set Trap Card " Hydradrive Nightmare ", tributing "Hydradrive Token" to Special Summon a "Hydradrive" monster from his GY, but it is destroyed during the End Phase. He Special Summons "Coolant Hydradrive". "Coolant Hydradrive" attacks directly, with the effect of "Judgment Arrows" doubling its ATK during damage calculation ("Coolant Hydradrive": 1000 → 2000 ATK; Blue Maiden: 3200 → 1200). Because she took battle damage, Blue Maiden activates her Skill "Shape of Sea", letting her Special Summon a WATER monster from her GY whose ATK is equal to or less than the damage she took. She Special Summons "Coral Anemone" back from the GY. During Harlin's End Phase, "Coolant Hydradrive" is destroyed due to the effect of "Hydradrive Nightmare" and since it was destroyed by battle or card effect, its effect Special Summons a "Hydradrive Token" in Defense Position.
 Turn 4: Blue Maiden 
Blue Maiden Normal Summons "Marincess Sea Horse". She uses "Sea Horse" and "Coral Anemone" to Link Summon " Marincess Marbled Rock " (2500/LINK-3/←↓→). Since "Coral Anemone" was sent to the GY, its effect lets Blue Maiden return "Sea Star" from her GY to her hand. As there is a Link-3 or Higher "Marincess" monster on the field, Blue Maiden activates "Marincess Wave" from her hand, negating the effect of "Twin Hydradrive Knight": Because she controls a Link-2 or higher "Marincess" monster, the other effect of "Marincess Wave" makes "Marbled Rock" unaffected by Harlin's card effects this turn. Blue Maiden activates the effect of "Sea Star" in her hand, sending it to the GY to increase the ATK of "Marbled Rock" by 800 ("Marbled Rock": 2500 → 3300 ATK). She activates the effect of "Marbled Rock", letting her return "Sea Star" from her GY to her hand. She then activates the effect of "Sea Star" again ("Marbled Rock": 3300 → 4100 ATK).
 "Marbled Rock" attacks "Twin Hydradrive Knight", with the effect of "Judgment Arrows" doubling the ATK of "Twin Hydradrive Knight" during damage calculation only ("Twin Hydradrive Knight": 1800 → 3600 ATK). "Twin Hydradrive Knight" is destroyed (Harlin: 1900 → 1400 LP). Because a Link-3 or higher "Marincess" monster destroyed a monster by battle, Blue Maiden activates the Trap Card " Marincess Current " from her hand. The effect of "Marincess Current" inflicts damage to Harlin equal to the Link Rating of that monster x 400 and since she controls a Link-2 or Higher "Marincess" it gets the additional effect of dealing damage equal to the destroyed monster's Link Rating x 500, so Harlin takes 2200 damage (Harlin: 1400 → 0 LP).
