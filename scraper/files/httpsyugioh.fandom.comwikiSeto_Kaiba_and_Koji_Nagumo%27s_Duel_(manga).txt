 Seto Kaiba  and  Koji Nagumo  Dueled in the preliminary rounds of the  Battle City  tournament.
 Kaiba initiated the Duel, after seeing Nagumo disrespect  Mokuba  and Kaiba easily won using " The God of the Obelisk ".
 Most of this Duel took place off panel.
 
 Events 
       Nagumo , terrorized by " The God of the Obelisk "     
 Nagumo was unhappy with the card he had won through the  ante rule , after one of his Duels. He demanded that his opponent give something of equal value to his card, " Hyozanryu " or ¥100,000 (about US$900 at the time).  Mokuba Kaiba  appeared and calls a foul for changing the ante and wagering money. Nagumo threatened Mokuba and told him not to mess with his rules.  Seto Kaiba  then arrived and warned Namugo that insulting Mokuba is insulting  Kaiba Corporation . He proceeded to tear up the "Hyozanryu" card, saying Nagumo was going to lose it anyway. He challenged him to a Duel, anteing a briefcase of rare cards and " The God of the Obelisk ". He allowed Nagumo to use the cards from the briefcase in the Duel, to compensate for "Hyozanryu", but said he would take them back after he won.
 At some point in the Duel, Kaiba Summoned "The God of the Obelisk", easily defeating Nagumo, leaving him sit on the street, traumatized by the power of "Obelisk", with his cards scattered across the ground. The man who had lost to Nagumo, after witnessing the Duel with Kaiba, picked up the card he had wagered against Nagumo and tore it to pieces.
