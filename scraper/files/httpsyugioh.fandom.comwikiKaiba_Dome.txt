 Yu-Gi-Oh! 
       Inside of Kaiba Dome (closed)     
 It is first seen in the  Grand Championship  arc, when  Mokuba  presents it to  Yugi  and his friends during a tour. While inside, Yugi, as well as  Rebecca Hawkins , are asked for autographs by several fans who were previously watching a Duel on a computer, the  KC DuelTek 760 , built in the center of the arena. One, named  Rick , asks Yugi for help with his  Deck , and he gives Rick the " Heart of the Underdog " card. Rick uses it in a Duel with the computer right away, but the Duel gets hacked by  Zigfried von Schroeder , drastically raising the stakes. Fortunately, Yugi takes over Rick's Duel and wins.
 Afterwards, the Kaiba Dome becomes the center of the Grand Championship tournament. The KC DuelTek 760 is also used again during Kaiba's Duel with Zigfried.
 
 Yu-Gi-Oh! GX 
 During the  Society of Light  arc in  Yu-Gi-Oh! GX , the Kaiba Dome is frequently used to house matches between  Pro League Duelists . However, the floor of the main arena has been changed from its original gray-ish white hue to a vibrant green, and the KC DuelTek 760 is removed.
 
 Yu-Gi-Oh! 5D's 
 In the dub of  Yu-Gi-Oh! 5D's , the  Memorial Circuit  is referred to as the Kaiba Dome.
