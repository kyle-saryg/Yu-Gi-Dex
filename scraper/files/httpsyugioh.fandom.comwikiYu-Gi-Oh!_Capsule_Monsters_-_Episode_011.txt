 " The True King - Part 1 " is the eleventh episode of the miniseries  Yu-Gi-Oh! Capsule Monsters .
 Shadi tells everyone that they must battle the evil Alex using their capsule monsters, the winners will be given the chance to obtain ultimate power. Alex's old servants from when he was originally in the pyramid return. Everyone in on a battlefield now, and release their monsters, beginning the final battle for ultimate power. As the gang fights Alexander's servants, he watches from his giant stone monster,  Reshef the Dark Being . As the rest of the gang defeat the servants' monsters, Alexander takes their power to summon  Seven-Armed Fiend .  Seven-Armed Fiend  is then revealed to be the monster from Yugi's dreams. Solomon remembers that every arm has a different ability making it almost indestructible. They all fight it, and, after much effort, finally defeat it. Alexander tells them they'll never win.
 
 Trivia 
 When Seven Armed Fiend is summoned, seven monsters were sacrificed to it. After it's destroyed later, only four monsters are returned; this suggests that it used the monsters' life energy for its powers. 
 Only six powers of the Seven-Armed Fiend are used. 
 The flashback is changed in the English Dub; it's obvious that Alexander's dark side killed his vassals, but its stated their souls were taken for his failure. 
 When Téa executed her attack for the real "Demoness Knight" to please blow up, this could be a reference to the famous line from the game show,  To Tell The Truth .
