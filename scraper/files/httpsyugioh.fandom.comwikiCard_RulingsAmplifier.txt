 Previously Official Rulings 
   These TCG rulings were issued by  Upper Deck Entertainment  and have since been deemed unofficial by Konami. [1]  They were previously considered official and can still be correct, as long as they follow the official gameplay rules, or unless Konami has issued a ruling that says otherwise. References:  [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] 
 
 Note that " Amplifier "'s activation and effect cannot be  negated . This is written on the card. 
 It is the  controller  of " Jinzo "  equipped  with " Amplifier ", not the controller of " Amplifier ", that can activate  Trap Cards . 
 If you equip " Amplifier " to your opponent's " Jinzo ", then your opponent can activate  Trap Cards  and they will not be  negated . 
 If you control 2 " Jinzos " and only 1 is equipped with " Amplifier ", you cannot activate  Trap Cards . 
 If you have " Jinzo  with  Amplifier "  [ sic ] , your  Trap Cards  are not  negated  and their effects are applied, including " Aqua Chorus ", " Royal Command ", " Royal Oppression ", " Coffin Seller ", " Forced Requisition ", " Mirror Wall ", " Gravity Bind ", " Rivalry of Warlords ", " Minor Goblin Official ", " Final Attack Orders ", " Pitch Black Power Stone "  [ sic ] , " Bad Reaction to Simochi ", " Skull Invitation ", " Skull Lair ", " The Eye of Truth ", " Spirit Invitation "  [ sic ] , " Respect Play ", " Ring of Destruction ", " Metalmorph ", " Torrential Tribute ", " Self-Destruct Button ", " Zero Gravity ", and " Big Burn ". 
 If you activate " Mask of Restrict " and you have " Jinzo " with " Amplifier ", " Mask of Restrict " is not  negated  and its effect still applies, so neither player may  Tribute . 
 If the  controller  of " Jinzo " with " Amplifier " has activated the effects of " Regulation of Tribe "  [ sic ] , " Spatial Collapse ", " Robbin' Goblin ", " Robbin' Zombie ", " Curse of Darkness ", etc., their effects are not  negated , but if the opponent activates them, they ARE  negated . 
 If your " Amplifier " is switched from your " Jinzo " to your opponent's " Jinzo " with " Tailor of the Fickle ", then your  Jinzo  is not  destroyed . 
 You cannot activate a card that would cause an infinite loop because its effect cannot  resolve  completely. Example #1: You activate " Snatch Steal " targeting your opponent's " Jinzo ". You then equip " Jinzo " with " Amplifier ". You cannot activate " Imperial Order " because it cannot resolve completely (it would negate " Snatch Steal ", returning " Jinzo " to your opponent, which would negate " Imperial Order " so " Snatch Steal " would re-activate). If you activate " Imperial Order " by mistake in such a situation, flip it  face-down  again. Example #2: you  control  " Jinzo "  equipped  with " Amplifier " and " Skill Drain ". Your opponent cannot activate " Royal Decree ".
