 Description 
 Yami Marik is Marik Ishtar's dark side created from the suffering he endured as a Gravekeeper. Cruel and vicious, he enjoys watching his opponents suffer. His appetite for destruction is incomprehensible. His "Lava Golem" can be summoned to the opponent's side of the field where it slowly puts the stranglehold on his foe.
 
 Biography 
 After his defeat and destruction during the Battle City finals, Yami Marik awoke in the world of Duel Links with his powers restored and the Winged Dragon of Ra once again in his possession. Yami Marik soon realized that he could not feel the original Marik's presence and used the opportunity to wreak havoc on Duel Links with his army of Rare Hunters. 
 As Yami Marik and his Rare Hunters terrorized the virtual world, many duelists began to wonder how Yami Marik had returned and what became of Marik Ishtar. While Yami Marik did not know the answer to either question, he suspected that Kaiba had something to do with his revival. Kaiba would neither confirm nor deny this.
 Eventually Yami Marik was defeated, which resulted in him not only losing his god card, but vanishing back into the Shadow Realm. The last thing that Yami Marik heard as he faded away was the true Marik bidding him to never return.
