 Biography 
 History 
 While gathering members to create an unbeatable team, Jean ran into  Andre   Dueling  someone and losing. Jean had noticed that Andre could have won if it wasn't for his weakness. He then offers him a spot on his team and Andre accepts.  After that, the two began traveling around, looking for a third member to join their team.  
 While tuning up one of their  Duel Runners , the two meet  Breo . He tells them to leave as it is "his" practice spot, but they refuse by stating that it is a public place. 
 Breo challenges them to a Duel and is defeated by Jean (unseen). Afterwards, Jean tells Breo he is a powerful opponent and that he has potential, asking him to form a team with himself and Andre.  Breo's girlfriend  then asks Jean if she could go out with him but he rejects her saying he dislikes women who aren't serious. During all the tournaments that follow, he's never had to Duel, since Andre has been able to handle it all on his own.
 
 Pre-World Racing Grand Prix 
 Jean is at the opening ceremonies for the  WRGP  along with his teammates. They all introduce themselves to  Team 5D's . 
 Later, he is practicing with the rest of  Team Unicorn  when  Crow  crashes into  Breo . He is infuriated and demands that there be a punishment. 
 The three decided to have them make up for it by having  Yusei   Duel   Andre , to which he accepts. He and Breo then discuss their plan to watch Yusei Duel and learn how he Duels. As he watches, he is impressed by Yusei's Dueling skills.
 
 World Riding Duel Grand Prix 
 After the opening ceremonies,  Team Unicorn  prepared their team for their match. Jean would be the "Last Wheeler" to  Duel . He watches  Andre 's Duels with  Jack  and  Akiza  and is still impressed with him. He then watches him Duel with Yusei after Andre defeats the two. 
 Jean signals Andre to lose so that  Breo  could take over and use his  Deck Destruction  strategy to win. However, Jean didn't count on Yusei defeating Breo, so Jean happily takes over and Duels Yusei to finish him off. Despite Breo having milled nearly all of Yusei's Deck, Jean changes his mind about defeating Yusei with Deck Destruction, and believing that it was the best Duel he has ever had, attacks Yusei's " Rapid Warrior " with his monster, even though Yusei was Deckless and would lose if Jean simply ended his turn. However, Yusei outsmarts Jean's moment of weakness, and uses " Stronghold Guardian " to effectively counter Jean's attack and reflect enough damage to defeat Jean.
 Although he had lost his Duel, Jean was satisfied with the result, and his teammates later approved of his actions during the Duel and did not mind about their incidental loss.
 Team Unicorn's next Duel was against  Team Catastrophe , but during the Duel both Andre and Jean crash, due to the use of the Shadow Card " Hook the Hidden Knight ". Jean is later seen at the hospital, when Breo leaves Yusei to check on him.

 Decks 
 Main article:  Jean's Decks 
 Jean plays a  Beatdown  Deck.  His trump card is " Lightning Tricorn ".
 Each member of Team Unicorn possesses a key Synchro Monster which can be considered representative of its user. Jean would be represented by "Lightning Tricorn" due to its being the strongest Unicorn Synchro. Its ability to  Special Summon  either " Thunder Unicorn " or " Voltic Bicorn " represents Jean's appreciation of team work and unity.
 
 Trivia 
 Jean is the second character to lose a Duel against Yusei despite having reduced his Deck to 0 cards. The first was  Mr. Armstrong .
