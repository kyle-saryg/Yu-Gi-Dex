 Dimension of the Wizards  is an original pack in the video game  Yu-Gi-Oh! Duel Links . It was first released in-game on March 12, 2019, 8:00 AM (EST).
 
 Description  
 The next level of Spellcaster and Psychic strategies! New  Madolche  and  Naturia  cards are here as well! 
 
 Featuring: 
" Arcanite Magician ", This Synchro Monster lets you destroy 1 card your opponent controls by removing 1 Spell Counter! This effect can be used multiple times per Duel, and since this monster comes with 2 Spell Counters placed on it, you'll be able to destroy 2 of your opponent's cards right away! 
" Dimensional Prison ", This Trap Card will banish your opponent's attacking monster! It banishes the monster without destroying it or sending it to the Graveyard, meaning you can prevent monster effects that trigger upon being destroyed or sent to the Graveyard. 
" Psychic Wheeleder ", This Tuner Monster can be Special Summoned in Defense Position from your hand if you control a Level 3 monster other than "Psychic Wheeleder". In addition, when this monster is sent to the Graveyard as a Synchro Material, you can destroy 1 monster your opponent controls with ATK less than the monster you Synchro Summoned using "Psychic Wheeleder" as a Synchro Material! 
" Glife the Phantom Bird ", When this monster is Summoned, you can destroy 1 Spell/Trap Card your opponent controls! Special Summon it from your Deck with the effect of " Golden Castle of Stromberg "! 
A total of 40 types of Cards: 3  UR , 10  SR , 17  R , and 20  N .
 
 
 
 Each box of  Dimension of the Wizards  contains 100 packs. Each pack contains 3 different cards, which will always consist of 2 Normal (aka Common) cards and 1 Rare, Super Rare, or Ultra Rare card. There is a guaranteed number of copies of each individual card per box, depending on its rarity:
