      Tropica City     
 Tropica City  is the location where series 2 of  Yu-Gi-Oh! BAM  is set.
 
 Further down the line, you'll be able to visit Tropica City, a new setting that has yet to be unveiled. In Tropica City, you'll be able to learn more about the Organizer, a being that was briefly teased about in the previous chapters. You'll also be introduced to the Channelers, ancient beings of tremendous power. 
 More importantly, the Tropica City storyline will not be as linear as Alba Litora's. Picture Tropica City as some sort of hub to which episodes will be attached. Each episode will launch with new cards, mechanics, characters, and more BAM!
