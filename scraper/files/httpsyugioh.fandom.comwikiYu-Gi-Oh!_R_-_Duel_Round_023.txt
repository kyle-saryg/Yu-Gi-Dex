 "Toy Magic!!"  is the twenty-third chapter of the  Yu-Gi-Oh! R  manga. It was first printed in Japan on March 3, 2006 in  V Jump  magazine. It was later reprinted in volume 3 of Yu-Gi-Oh! R.
 Depre 's strategy using " Cosmic Space " is put into action, and monsters can only survive with  Life Star Counters .  Dark Yugi  believes  Yugi 's trapped " Toy Magician " to be the key to victory.
 
 Featured Duel: Yugi Mutou vs. Depre Scott 
 Duel continues in  the previous chapter . 
 Turn 5: Yugi 
 Yugi   Normal Summons  " Toy Magician " (1600/1500) in  Defense Position , who gains four  Life Star Counters  via " Cosmic Space ". He then  Sets  a card. At the  End Phase , all monsters lose a Life Star Counter.
 Turn 6: Depre 
 Depre  Normal Summons " Lyra the Giver " (1800/1500) in Attack Position, who gains four Life Star Counters via "Cosmic Space". " Zeta Reticulant "  attacks  "Toy Magician", but Yugi  activates  his  face-down  " Toy Box ", placing "Toy Magician" and another " Toy "  monster  from his  hand  in the "Toy Box" to prevent it from becoming a  target . "Toy Magician" will be unaffected by "Cosmic Space" so long as it in the "Toy Box". At the End Phase, all monsters lose a Life Star Counter.
 
       " Toy Box " hides Yugi's monsters.     
 Turn 7: Yugi 
Yugi's  hand  contains " Polymerization ". He releases the monster he put in the "Toy Box" from his hand and returns to the field - " Toy Tank " (???/???). He  Tributes  it to Normal Summon " Dark Red Enchanter " (2300/2200) in  Defense Position , who gains six Life Star Counters via "Cosmic Space". At the End Phase, all monsters lose a Life Star Counter. "Zeta Reticulant" is  destroyed  as it has no more counters and Depre Special Summons two " Eva Tokens " (500/300) via its effect.
 Turn 8: Depre 
Depre Tributes his two "Eva Tokens" to Summon " Greed Quasar " in Attack Position. It gains seven Life Star Counters via "Cosmic Space". Its has 300  ATK  and  DEF  for each Life Star Counter it has, therefore it has 2100 of each. Depre activates the effect of "Lyra the Giver",  sending  it to the  Graveyard  to transfer its two remaining Life Star Counters to "Greed Quasar" and increasing its stats to 2700 each. "Greed Quasar" attacks and destroys "Dark Red Enchanter", with its effect activating, increases its Life Star Counters by that of any monster it destroyed. Its ATK and DEF become 4200.
