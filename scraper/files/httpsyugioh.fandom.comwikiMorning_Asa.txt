      Morning Asa     
 Morning Asa  (モーニング朝,  Mōningu Asa ; literally  Morning Morning ) is a TV news broadcast in the  Yu-Gi-Oh!  first series anime . [1] 
 It reported a number of robberies that were suspected to have been committed by  Tetsu Tasaki , which unbeknownst to them at the time were committed by  Jiro . It also reported an unsuccessful robbery at  Ushijima Finance , where the safe had been emptied beforehand, stating it was unknown if this robbery was related to the others. The real Tetsu Taseki, who had performed the unsuccessful robbery, heard this report and was angered that he was suspected of crimes he didn't commit and the one he actually did commit was being mocked.
