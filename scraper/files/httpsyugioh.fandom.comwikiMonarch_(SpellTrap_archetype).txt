 " Monarch " ( 帝 王   Teiō ), also referred to as " Emperor " in the  Yu-Gi-Oh ARC-V  manga , is an  archetype  of  Spell  and  Trap Cards  that support  Tribute Summoned  monsters like the " Monarch "  series . It was first introduced in  Cosmo Blazer ; after  Shadow Specters  introduced the "Mega Monarchs", these cards' artwork show how the "Monarchs" transformed into the "Mega Monarchs".
 Due to its Japanese name, " Emperor of the Land and Sea " falls into this archetype. Despite having "Monarch" in their English names, the monsters in the "Monarch" series are not a part of this archetype due to their Japanese names. However, because  TCG  and  OCG  support for this archetype only works on  Spell / Trap Cards  that are not on the field, neither of these cases currently has an impact on gameplay.
 Each has a unique effect that activates on the condition that prevents monsters from being  Special Summoned  from the  Extra Deck  or requires that there be no cards in the Extra Deck, although " Escalation of the Monarchs ", " Strike of the Monarchs " and " Tenacity of the Monarchs " do not require these conditions to trigger their effects.
 As a draw engine, " Tenacity of the Monarchs " can search for " Pantheism of the Monarchs " to dump " The Prime Monarch ", Prime being useful as Tribute or Material for Summon; and does not restrict use of the Extra Deck.  Is repeatable using  PSY-Framelord Omega ".
 When combined with the effects of " Trade-In " and " Erebus the Underworld Monarch ", this draw engine quickly enables a  Chaos -like Graveyard engine capable of recycling powerful Monsters like " Black Luster Soldier - Envoy of the Beginning " or " Dark Armed Dragon ".
