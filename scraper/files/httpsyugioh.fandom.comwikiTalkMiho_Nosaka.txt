How do you change the the characters main picture? 
 Could someone please tell me because I don't really care much for the picture that Miho has as her icon since it doesn't reflect her cheerful and sweet personality.
 
 It's because that is best closely image we can get. Get over with it please. -- F r e d C a t  00:45, April 17, 2011 (UTC)
