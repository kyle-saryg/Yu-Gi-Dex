 Summary 
 Jack  has  Dueled   Greiger 's younger brother  Max , who was possessed by a demon but his power based strategy falls to the Devil-possessed Max's Power Reversal strategy (the symbolism of which spooks Jack visibly). 
 Because of this, Jack forced to realize the limits of his own strength. "I want absolutely overwhelming might.", this thought is so strong in Jack's mind. 
 Later, after he hears an  elderly  villager say "Go make a wish to  The Crimson Devil , Jack goes to the temple where "The Crimson Devil" is enshrined. 
 Because he seeks more power, Jack is invitingly tempted into a Duel with  Familiar of Red Nova  and the servant makes him an offer. The servant says to him "My Lord, if you want to be stronger, then the power thine wants can be obtained...".
 Because he is in a hurry, Jack enters into a Duel that serves as a ritualistic contract, with the fire demon as his opponent. Against  monsters  that inflict  damage  to him when  destroyed , Jack struggles, while wondering what the Crimson Devil's true intentions are. 
 His true intentions are revealed without issue as the Devil's Familiar already feels he has won.  It wishes to use Jack's body as avatar for the return of The Crimson Devil, the last and strongest of the  Earthbound Immortals  who itself already fought The  Crimson Dragon  alone and lost 10,000 years ago.

 Turn 1: Familiar 
The Familiar draws. He then  Normal Summons  " Abyss Kid " ( 1/0/0) in  Defense Position  and  sets  a card.
 Turn 2: Jack 
Jack draws "Big Piece Golem". Since the Familiar controls monsters and Jack doesn't, he  Normal Summons  " Big Piece Golem " ( 5/2100/0) in Attack Position. "Big Piece Golem"  attacks  and destroys " Abyss Kid ". Since "Abyss Kid" was destroyed and sent to the Graveyard, its first effect  activates , inflicting 800  damage  to  Jack  (Jack 4000 → 3200). Jack  Sets  a card (" Red Screen ").
 Turn 3: Familiar 
The Familiar draws " Abyss Boat Watchman " and subsequently Normal Summons it ( 1/0/0) in  Attack Position . Due to the second  effect  of "Abyss Kid", "Abyss Boat Watchman" is  destroyed  immediately. Since "Abyss Boat Watchman" was destroyed and sent to the Graveyard, its first effect  activates , inflicting 800  damage  to  Jack  (Jack 3200 → 2400). The Familiar then activates " Spirit Wave Barrier ". Now if Jack attacks directly, the attack Jack made is negated and the monster that made the direct attack is destroyed. On the Familiar's third End Phase after this card's activation, he must destroy this card.
 Turn 4: Jack 
Jack  draws  " Power Breaker " and subsequently Normal Summons it ( 4/1900/0) in Attack Position. "Power Breaker" attacks directly, but the first effect of "Spirit Wave Barrier" negates the attack and  destroys  "Power Breaker".

Since "Power Breaker" was destroyed, Jack activates its first effect to destroy " Spirit Wave Barrier ". 
 "Big Piece Golem" attacks directly, but the  Familiar   activates  his face-down " Guidance to the Abyss " to  Special Summon  " Abyss Guardian " ( 1/0/0) from his Deck in Defense Position. The second effect of "Abyss Kid" then activates, destroying "Abyss Guardian". Since "Abyss Guardian" was destroyed and sent to the Graveyard, its first effect activates, inflicting 800  damage  to  Jack  (Jack 2400 → 1600).
