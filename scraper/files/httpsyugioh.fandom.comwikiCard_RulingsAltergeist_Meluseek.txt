 OCG Rulings 
 When " Altergeist Meluseek " battles an opponent’s monster and destroys it by battle, and your opponent takes battle damage, the monster that was destroyed cannot be targeted with the effect of " Altergeist Meluseek ". (If there are no other cards on your opponent’s field, you cannot activate the effect of " Altergeist Meluseek ".) 
 When activating the effect of " Altergeist Meluseek " that sends a card on the field to the Graveyard, you can also target a Pendulum Monster. (In that case, the Pendulum Monster is not sent to the Graveyard, but is added face-up to the Extra Deck.)
