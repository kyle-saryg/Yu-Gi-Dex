Overextending  is the process of a player filling their  Monster Zones  and/or  Spell & Trap Zones  with more cards than necessary, leaving the player at risk from  nukes  such as " Dark Hole " or " Black Rose Dragon ". Having a full field may also prevent them from playing new cards.
 A modern example of overextending would be the now-infamous  Extra Link  mechanic. While such a powerful field can win games by itself, without sufficient protection and/or if too many resources are committed to the setup, the loss of the board can lead to a major disadvantage, both in  card advantage  and spare resources.
