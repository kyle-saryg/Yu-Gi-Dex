 Synopsis 
 A female announcer arrives and explains how, following the events of  Bonds Beyond Time , the question was posed of who would win in a duel between Yugi and Yusei. Two reporters conducted a poll as Green and Abbey voice the game as two duelists portray the moves on a screen.
 Yugi takes the first move, although Yusei wins the first battle of the duel. On the next round of turns, Yugi plays his iconic " Chimera the Flying Mythical Beast ", but Yusei surprises Yugi by countering with a  Synchro Monster : " Junk Warrior ". As Yusei continues to hold the upper hand, he is able to summon his  signature card : " Stardust Dragon ". However, with a slew of  Forbidden   Spell Cards , Yugi is able to set up three of his most iconic monsters: " Dark Magician Girl ", " Dark Magician ", " Buster Blader ". In response, Yusei also  swarms  with three monsters of his own, enabling him to upgrade his "Stardust Dragon" into " Shooting Star Dragon ". Yugi also takes his own signature monster, "Dark Magician", to perform his second  Fusion Summon  into " Dark Paladin ". "Shooting Star Dragon's" ability to negate attacks by temporarily removing itself from the field prevents Yugi from using "Dark Paladin" to destroy it in battle; however, Yugi takes advantage of "Shooting Star Dragon's" momentary absence to use " De-Fusion ", allowing him to suddenly summon both "Dark Magician" and "Buster Blader" to attack and win the duel.
 Yugi congratulates Yusei for the duel, and Yusei refers back to him as the  Pharaoh . The show concludes with a reference to  Yu-Gi-Oh! The Abridged Series  and  Tristan Taylor  (who Abbey also voices).
