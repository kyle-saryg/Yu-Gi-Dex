 There's  Renge, Gatekeeper of Dark World  waiting at a corner. The player talks to him, and each time the player does they will find themselves in a Tag Duel with some of the  Dark World  denizens, and will also have to ante a card with "Dark World" in its name. The teams are:

 After clearing the Gate,  Nurse Reficule the Fallen One  will randomly appear, and she may randomly change the appearance of the player's face for 500 DP. The only ways to change or revert the result is to either wait for her to reappear, or to close the game before it can save. The player can change to any of the 10 faces that the game originally offered, or a special variant of those faces for a total of 20 possibilities.
