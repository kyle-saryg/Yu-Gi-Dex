 Deck 
 Boot and Bit use a  " D-Scale " Deck , which focuses on quickly swarming the field with materials to Link to Summon "D-Scale" Link Monsters and apply various effect based on the movement of the "D-Scale" Link Monsters around their own field.
 In the strategy named "Voyage to Hell" ( 地 獄 への 航 海 ,  Jigoku e no Kōkai ), they quickly summon " D-Scale Battle Coela " and equip it with " D-Scale Torpedo " and activate " Judgment Arrows " with the help of their  Skill  "Marker's Portal". Then using its own effect, they move "Battle Coela" twice in their own field with the help of the  Link Arrows  of "Judgment Arrows" and activate the effect of "Torpedo" to deal large effect damage to the opponent.
 Their other strategy revolve around summoning " D-Scale Full Metal Dunkle " which can't be destroyed once per turn and then utilize its own effect to move it to a appropriate Monster Zone to destroy one monster their opponent controls at the  End Phase  which is in the same column as "Full Metal Dunkle" after it has been moved.
 They also utilize cards like " D-Scale Chaff " to Lock Down their opponents hand and field, thus making them unable to neither set up a defense or attack or utilize any effect to counter for a turn.
