  The Quantum Cube, dimmed.   The Quantum Cube, illuminated. 1/2 
 The  Quantum Cube  ( 量子 キューブ  Ryōshi Kyūbu ) is a mystical object of great power used by  Aigami  in  Yu-Gi-Oh! The Dark Side of Dimensions . It previously belonged to  Shadi .
 According to  Sera , the cube is an eighth  Millennium Item . [1] [2] 
 
 History 
 Shadi had used it to kill an abusive man who once lived with some orphans, including  Diva ,  Mani , and  Sera . After his death at the hands of  Yami Bakura , Shadi handed the Cube over to Aigami.
 Aigami later used it to transport  Scud  and  his gang  to another dimension, and used it to teleport from the mall in  Domino City  to the  Valley of the Kings  in Egypt, where he disintegrated a  KaibaCorp  employee, and attempted to kill  Kaiba  with it, albeit unsuccessfully, then attempted to kill  Ryo Bakura  and  Joey Wheeler  with it. In the latter instance he was foiled by  Atem . While in the Valley of Kings, he transformed it into a  Duel Disk  to Duel Kaiba, and later to Duel  against   Yugi .
 
       The Millennium Ring bonded to the Quantum Cube     
 Following his defeat at Yugi's hands, Aigami was transported to another dimension where he stumbled upon the  Millennium Ring ; without even touching it, he was corrupted by its evil and upon returning to the main dimension, reveals that he bonded it with the Quantum Cube in order to bring about his corrupted vision of a new world.
After Aigami's final defeat, Kaiba took possession of the Cube, using it to enter the afterlife in order to Duel Atem.
 
 Abilities 
       The Quantum Cube's Duel Disk form     
 Using the cube, Aigami can transport people to an alternate dimension, where they will disintegrate and die if not rescued. It can also directly disintegrate people. 
 The world he sent Joey to was made up of and sustained by his memories, and as soon as he forgot something, it would disappear. However, Joey could also remember things to recreate a place, such as the street he rode his bike down earlier.
 KaibaCorp 's virtual technology is capable of combating its power, as  Seto Kaiba  mocked Aigami's effort to disintegrate him with his own power and counteracted it.

But if even a single drop of evil mixes in, it will remake the world into a dimension of darkness. Such is the power of the cube. Such is the power of the eighth Millennium Item."
