 OCG Rulings 
 The activation of only the card " All-Out Attacks " can be performed at any time, except during the  Damage Step . [1] 
 The effect " All monsters that are Special Summoned are changed to face-up Attack Position and must attack, if able, during the turn they are Special Summoned " makes a  Chain Link . (It activates even during the  Damage Step .) [1] 
 The card " All-Out Attacks " cannot be activated in the same  Chain Link  as its effect. [1] 
 The effect of "All-Out Attacks" does not target. (It is applied to monsters that were successfully  Special Summoned  when the effect of "All-Out Attacks" was activated.) [1] 
 Previously Official Rulings 
   These TCG rulings were issued by  Upper Deck Entertainment  and have since been deemed unofficial by Konami. [2]  They were previously considered official and can still be correct, as long as they follow the official gameplay rules, or unless Konami has issued a ruling that says otherwise. References:  [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] 
 
 " All-Out Attacks " starts a  Chain  whenever a monster is Special Summoned, even if the monster is Special Summoned in Attack Position. 
 Monsters that are Special Summoned  face-down  are also changed to face-up Attack Position. 
 If " All-Out Attacks " is activated when a monster is Special Summoned, its effect is not applied because it must already be face-up on the field at the time the monster is Special Summoned.
