 Major Events 
 When a player's LP reach 0, the glass floor under them will break, opening a vortex that will suck them into the  Shadow Realm  (in the Japanese version, the loser just simply plunges to their death). 
 Joey ,  Téa , and  Mokuba  are held hostage. 
 Featured Duel: Yami Yugi + Seto Kaiba vs. Lumis + Umbra, Part 2 
 Duel continued from previous episode. 
 All players still have 4000  Life Points  remaining.
 Lumis controls " Mask of Brutality " (which is equipped to "Shining Abyss") and one set card.
 Yami Yugi controls "Beta The Magnet Warrior" (1700/1600) in Defense Position
 Umbra controls "Shining Abyss" (2600/800) in Defense Position and " Masked Doll ".
 Kaiba controls "Vorse Raider" (1900/1200) in Attack Position and two set cards.
 Turn 5: Lumis 
 Lumis  draws " Mask of the Accursed " and subsequently activates it,  equipping  it to  Yami Yugi 's " Beta The Magnet Warrior ". Now the equipped monster can't attack and if it's the only monster Yugi controls, Lumis or Umbra can attack Yami Yugi directly. During each of Yami Yugi's Standby Phases, "Mask of the Accursed" will inflict 500 damage to him.  Lumis   Sets  a card.
 Turn 6: Yami Yugi 
Yami Yugi draws "Beast of Gilfer". The effect of "Mask of the Accursed"  effect   activates  (Yami Yugi 4000 → 3500).  Yami Yugi  attempts to  Tribute  "Beta The Magnet Warrior" in order to  Tribute Summon  " Beast of Gilfer ", but  Lumis   activates  his face-down " Mask of Restrict ". Now  Yami Yugi  and  Kaiba  are forbidden from  tributing  any of their monsters for a Tribute Summon.  Yami Yugi  then  Sets  a card and  Normal Summons  " Kuriboh " (300/200) in  Defense Position .
 Turn 7: Umbra 
 Umbra  draws. He then  Sets  a card and switches " Shining Abyss " (2600/800) to  Attack Position . "Shining Abyss"  attacks  "Vorse Raider", but  Kaiba   activates  his face-down " Ring of Destruction " to  destroy  "Shining Abyss" and inflict  damage  to both  Kaiba  and  Umbra  equal to the ATK of "Shining Abyss".  Lumis  then  activates  his face-down " Curse Transfer " to change the  target  of "Ring of Destruction" to " Vorse Raider "; "Vorse Raider" is destroyed.  Kaiba  then  activates  his face-down " Ring of Defense " to protect his  Life Points  from the effect of "Ring of Destruction", but  Umbra   activates  his face-down " Spell Transfer " to negate the effect of "Ring of Defense" and activate the effect of "Spell Transfer" as the effect of "Ring of Defense", allowing Umbra to protect himself from the effect of "Ring of Destruction" (Seto Kaiba 4000 → 2100). 
 A replay then occurs and Umbra uses "Shining Abyss" to  attack   Kaiba  directly, but  Yami Yugi   activates  his face-down " Multiply " to create a large wall made up of "Kuribohs". The attack destroys part of the wall, but the wall quickly regenerates shortly after the attack is through.
 Turn 8: Kaiba 
 Kaiba  draws " Blue-Eyes White Dragon ". He then  Sets  a card and  Normal Summons  " Battle Ox " (1700/1000) in  Defense Position .
 Turn 9: Lumis 
 Lumis  draws " Mask of Dispel " and subsequently activates it by targeting "Multiply". Now the targeted Magic Card's effects are negated and during each of Yugi's Standby Phases, he will take 500 damage. With "Multiply" negated, the "Kuriboh" wall is reduced back down to just one "Kuriboh". Lumis then  Normal Summons  " Grand Tiki Elder " (1500/800) in  Attack Position . "Grand Tiki Elder"  attacks  and  destroys  "Kuriboh".
 Turn 10: Yami Yugi 
Yami Yugi's hand contains " Card of Destruction ", "Beast of Gilfer", " Berfomet ", and " Shift ". Yami Yugi draws " Chain Destruction ". The effects of " Mask of the Accursed " and " Mask of Dispel " activate (Yami Yugi 3500 → 3000 → 2500).  Yami Yugi   Sets  a card.
 Turn 11: Umbra 
 Umbra  draws. He then  activates  " Curse of the Masked Beast " to Tribute his "Shining Abyss" and Lumis' "Grand Tiki Elder" and  Ritual Summon  " The Masked Beast " (3200/1800) in  Attack Position . 
 "The Masked Beast"  attacks   Yami Yugi  directly, but  Kaiba  blocks the  attack  with "Battle Ox". "The Masked Beast"  destroys  "Battle Ox".  Yami Yugi  then  activates  his face-down "Card Destruction" to make every duelist  discard  their  hand  and  draw  the same numbers of cards they  discarded . Since "Beast of Gilfer" was  sent  to the  Graveyard , its  effect  activates, allowing  Yami Yugi  to  equip  it to "The Masked Beast" and decrease its  ATK  by 500 ("The Masked Beast": 3200 → 2700/1800), but this isn't known to the other players yet.
 Turn 12: Kaiba 
 Kaiba  draws. He then activates his face-down " Monster Reborn " to  Special Summon  "Blue-Eyes White Dragon" (3000/2500) from his Graveyard in Attack Position.
 Duel continues next episode. 
 
 Changes to the dub 
 Bakura's blood pack is recolored. 
 Battle Ox being attacked by the Masked Beast is obscured. 
 The shot of Gilfer being sent to the graveyard and its hand reaching out from it (taken from the following episode), and Yugi's fierce look afterwards are added to the dub. 
 
 
 Errors 
 Ever since Lumis equipped his "Mask of the Accursed" to Yugi's "Beta the Magnet Warrior", the monster is continually shown on every shot of his Duel Disk in Attack Position, even though he summoned it in Defense Position. This mistake is first shown after Yugi draws "Beast of Gilfer", in a scene with his Duel Disk. 
 During the turn that Yugi Summoned " Kuriboh ", he placed a card face-down beforehand. However, he places the cards in his  Duel Disk  in reverse order. 
 When Umbra was about to play "Curse of the Masked Beast", he had six cards in his hand, but he should only have five cards as he set a card on turn 7. 
 In the dub, one of the shots of Yami Yugi's  Duel Disk  shows "Mask of the Accursed" where "Beta The Magnet Warrior" should be. 
 In the dub, when Yami Yugi draws "Chain Destruction" and when normal Yugi was explaining what the card does, he left out the fact that the card's effect can only be used when a certain monster (one with 2000 or less  ATK ) is Summoned to the field and that "Chain Destruction" destroys cards in the  Deck  as well. 
 In the dub, when Kaiba targets Shining Abyss with Ring of Destruction, he says both of them will lose nearly 2000 Life Points, which would indicate that their version of the card deals the original ATK. However, Shining Abyss has over 2000 ATK points and later episodes have it deal the current ATK of the monster, just like the TCG. 
 In this episode, Mokuba erroneously calls his brother Kaiba instead of Seto like he usually does in the other four seasons
