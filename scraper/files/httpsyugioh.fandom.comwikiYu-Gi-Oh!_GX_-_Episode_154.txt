 Summary 
   This summary is currently incomplete. 
 Jaden  reawakens the dormant powers of  The Supreme King  inside his own mind as he continues his final  Duel  with  Yubel . Jaden declares that since Yubel was affected by  The Light of Destruction , he will call out his friends from the darkness - the " Neo-Spacians ". In the Japanese version, Yubel finally accepts that Jaden will never agree with her twisted view of love, and resolves to fuse the twelve dimensions, ending existence altogether. In the English version, she does not abandon her goal, but aims to fuse the twelve dimensions to unite her and Jaden forever. She now intends to fuse the twelve dimensions together to destroy them, rather than to rule over them with Jaden at her side. Yubel counters Jaden's every move, and is eventually able to Summon her evolved form " Yubel - Terror Incarnate ". Yubel confirms that  Syrus  was correct - Jaden's friends are not dead, but trapped in another dimension. Jaden Summons " Rainbow Neos ".
 
 Featured Duel: Jaden Yuki vs. Yubel 
 Duel continues from  the previous episode . 
 Turn 8: Jaden 
Jaden draws " Neospace Wave " and subsequently activates it to send " Elemental Hero Sparkman ",  Elemental Hero Avian " and " Elemental Hero Burstinatrix " to the Graveyard,  Special Summon  " Neo-Spacian Aqua Dolphin " (600/800) and " Neo-Spacian Glow Moss " (300/900) in Attack Position and Special Summon " Neo-Spacian Air Hummingbird " (800/600) in Defense Position. The effect of " Spell Chronicle " activates, giving it a second  Chronicle Counter .
 Jaden then activates " NEX " to Tribute "Neo-Spacian Glow Moss" and Special Summon " Neo-Spacian Twinkle Moss " (500/1100) in Attack Position. Yubel explains that "Spell Chronicle" can only hold a maximum of two Chronicle Counters, so its second effect doesn't activate at this point. [Notes 1]  Jaden then activates the effect of "Air Hummingbird" to gain 500  Life Points  for every card in Yubel's hand. Yubel has three (Jaden 1000 → 2500). 
 "Neo-Spacian Twinkle Moss" attacks. The effect of "Twinkle Moss" then activates, forcing Jaden to  draw one card  and reveal it. Depending on the card's type, an appropriate effect will be applied. Jaden reveals the Spell Card, " Space Gift ", so the attack can be changed to a direct attack. "Twinkle Moss" attacks  directly  (Yubel 3900 → 3400). Jaden then activates "Space Gift" to draw a card for each Neo-Spacian he controls. Jaden has three, so he draws three cards. [Notes 2]  Jaden then  Sets  a card.
 Turn 9: Yubel 
Yubel draws. She then activates the third effect of "Spell Chronicle" to remove its two Chronicle Counters and make Jaden select one of the cards removed by "Spell Chronicle". Jaden selects " Fiend Rose ", so the latter is added to Yubel's  hand . " Yubel " attacks "Aqua Dolphin" twice. Due to the first two effects of "Yubel", it is not destroyed and Jaden takes the Battle Damage that Yubel would have taken (Jaden 2500 → 1900 → 1300).
 Yubel then  Sets  two cards. On Yubel's End Phase, " Samsara Lotus " revives itself (0/0) in Attack Position through its first effect. [Notes 3]  Yubel then Tributes "Samsara Lotus" in order to keep "Yubel" in play.
 Turn 10: Jaden 
Jaden draws "Card Ejector". He then activates the effect of "Air Hummingbird" and Yubel has three cards in her hand (Jaden 1300 → 2800). Jaden then  Normal Summons  " Card Ejector " (400/400) in Attack Position. He then activates the effect of "Card Ejector" to remove from play "Samsara Lotus" from Yubel's Graveyard, but Yubel activates her face-down " Zero Hole " to  negate  the effect of "Card Ejector" and destroy it. Jaden then activates his face-down " Neo Signal " to Special Summon " Neo-Spacian Grand Mole " (900/300) in Attack Position.
 "Grand Mole" attacks "Yubel" (Jaden intends to activate the effect of "Grand Mole" and return both battling monsters to their owners' hands without applying damage calculation), but Yubel activates her face-down " Hate Buster " to destroy both battling monsters and inflict damage to Jaden equal to the ATK of "Grand Mole" (Jaden 2800 → 1900). Since "Yubel" was destroyed by an effect besides its third effect, its final effect activates, allowing Yubel to Special Summon " Yubel - Terror Incarnate "(0/0) in Attack Position. [Notes 4] 
 "Neo-Spacian Twinkle Moss" attacks. The effect of "Twinkle Moss" activates, forcing Jaden to draw one card. Jaden reveals, the Monster, " Elemental Hero Prisma ", so the  Battle Phase  automatically ends. Jaden then Sets a card.
 Turn 11: Yubel 
Yubel draws. "Yubel - Terror Incarnate" attacks "Neo-Spacian Aqua Dolphin". Due to the first two effects of "Yubel - Terror Incarnate", it is not destroyed and Jaden takes the Battle Damage Yubel would have taken (Jaden 1900 → 1300). [Notes 5] 
 On Yubel's End Phase, "Samsara Lotus" revives itself (0/0) in Attack Position through its first effect. Yubel then activates the third effect of "Yubel - Terror Incarnate" to destroy "Samsara Lotus" and destroy "Neo-Spacian Air Hummingbird". [Notes 6] 
 Turn 12: Jaden 
Jaden draws " Polymerization ". He then Tributes "Aqua Dolphin" in order to Tribute Summon "Elemental Hero Prisma" (1700/1100) in  Defense Position . [Notes 7]  "Twinkle Moss" attacks. The effect of "Twinkle Moss" activates, forcing Jaden to draw one card and reveal it. Jaden reveals, the Spell Card, " Fake Hero ". "Twinkle Moss" attacks directly  (Yubel 3400 → 2900).
 Turn 13: Yubel 
Yubel draws. "Yubel - Terror Incarnate" attacks "Prisma". The attack fails, but due to the second effect of "Yubel - Terror Incarnate", Jaden takes the Battle Damage Yubel would have taken (Jaden 1300 → 200). On Yubel's End Phase, "Samsara Lotus" revives itself (0/0) in Attack Position through its first effect. Yubel then activates the third effect of "Yubel - Terror Incarnate" to destroy "Samsara Lotus" and destroy "Neo-Spacian Twinkle Moss".
 Turn 14: Jaden 
Jaden draws. He then activates "Fake Hero" to Special Summon " Elemental Hero Neos " (2500/2000) in Attack Position. The effect of "Spell Chronicle" activates, giving it a Chronicle Counter. Jaden then activates the effect of "Elemental Hero Prisma" to send " Rainbow Dragon " from his Deck to the Graveyard and treat "Prisma" as "Rainbow Dragon" until the end of the turn. [Notes 8]  Jaden then activates "Polymerization" to fuse "Elemental Hero Neos" with "Rainbow Dragon" in order to Fusion Summon " Rainbow Neos " (4500/3000) in Attack Position. The effect of "Spell Chronicle" then activates, giving it a second Chronicle Counter.
 Duel concludes in  the next episode .
