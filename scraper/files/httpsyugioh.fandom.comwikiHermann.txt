 Biography 
 History 
 Hermann along with  Hans  and  Nicolas  were originally from the dark slums of  Satellite , but when it merged with  New Domino City  they expected a change to their lives, but not much happened. Then when they gave up hope,  Primo  appeared before them with a "beacon of hope" in the form of dark cards which he said will take them all to the top and make them  Kings .
 
 World Racing Grand Prix 
 Hermann was originally seen when he used the  effect  of " Hook the Hidden Knight " to cause  Crow Hogan 's  Duel Runner  to crash (his identity was a mystery for several episodes), thus resulting in Crow's right arm being broke; due to this Crow couldn't enter in the  World Racing Grand Prix . He was later seen a long with his teammates  Hans  and  Nicolas  smirking at the defeated  Team Unicorn , even though they were in danger due to fatal crashes within the Duel Stadium. He was then later seen when  Team 5D's  were Dueling his team within the WRGP. He tried to cause Crow to crash again, but due to Crow's knowledge of the dark card he was able to avoid its attacks thus causing Hermann to be defeated by him. When he returned to the bay to switch teammates he was greeted by an angry  Nicolas  who snatched the flag.
