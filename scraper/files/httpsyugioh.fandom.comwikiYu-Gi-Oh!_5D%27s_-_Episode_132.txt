 " Dawn of the Machines ", known as " Violent Assault!! Machine Emperor Wisel " in the Japanese version, is the one-hundred-and-thirty-second episode of the  Yu-Gi-Oh! 5D's  anime. It first aired in Japan on October 20, 2010 and in the United States on August 20, 2011.
 Jack  who has won against  Lester , fights against  Team New World 's second wheeler,  Primo . 
 Primo  summons  " Meklord Emperor Wisel " and  attacks  with it, while Jack, building on the momentum he's gathered, fights back with " Red Nova Dragon ", inflicting huge damage to Primo. 
 What follows is a fierce fight against each other where neither one will give the other an inch. However, after watching Primo use cards that were meant to be for  Jakob , Jakob convinces Primo to follow the original strategy.
 In the end, when Primo's  Life Points  are reduced by a massive amount by " Burning Strike ", Primo  Sets  2 cards without countering (confusing everyone over how he wouldn't counter). Team 5D's notices that their strategy would have something to do with " Infinite Aura "; Jack, after getting Yusei's message,  tries to destroy  it; but Primo  goes as far as to disable all his Monsters  to protect it, thus losing the Duel. Yusei now has a dark premonition of the future, knowing that there is no way Jack could have won against both Lester and Primo that easily.
 Jakob then takes Primo's place, Summoning the final " Meklord Emperor "; " Granel ". Their entire strategy becomes clear to everyone when Jakob uses " Speed Spell - Takeover " to get rid of "Infinite Aura" and gain 8000 LP, thus giving "Granel" 12000 ATK in total. It easily defeats Jack, and absorbs his "Red Nova Dragon".

 Featured Duels 
 Jack Atlas vs. Primo 
 Duel continues from  the previous episode . 
 Turn 6: Primo 
Primo draws " Wise Core ". During the Standby Phase, the effect of " Speed World 2 " activates (Jack's SPC: 4 → 5; Primo's SPC: 4 → 5). Primo Normal Summons "Wise Core" ( 1/0/0) in  Defense Position . Primo then  activates  " Speed Spell - Lightning Rod " to  destroy  "Wise Core". Since "Wise Core" was destroyed by a card effect and sent to the Graveyard, its  effect  activates, Special Summoning " Meklord Emperor Wisel " ( 1/0/0) in Attack Position, " Wisel Top " ( 1/500/0) in Attack Position, " Wisel Attack " ( 1/1200/0) in Attack Position, " Wisel Guard " ( 1/0/1200) in Defense Position, and " Wisel Carrier " ( 1/800/600) in Attack Position. Due to the effect of "Meklord Emperor Wisel", its ATK becomes equal to the combined ATK of all other Wisel monsters Primo controls ("Meklord Emperor Wisel": 0 → 2500/0).
 Primo activates the effect of "Meklord Emperor Wisel" to equip itself with " Red Nova Dragon ", but  Jack  activates the third effect of "Red Nova Dragon" to  remove it from play  until the End Phase and allow Jack to negate one attack this turn. Primo then activates his face-down " Infinity Barrage " to inflict 400 damage to Jack for each monster he controls (Jack 4000 → 2000). Primo  Sets  two cards. On Primo's End Phase, "Red Nova Dragon"  returns  to the  field  ( 12/3500 → 5500/3000) in Attack Position.
 Turn 7: Jack Atlas 
Jack draws "Synchro Sonic". During the Standby Phase, the effect of "Speed World 2" activates (Jack's SPC: 5 → 6; Primo's SPC: 5 → 6). "Red Nova Dragon"  attacks  "Meklord Emperor Wisel", but Primo activates the effect of "Wisel Guard" to redirect the attack to it instead. Jack activates his face-down " Burning Strike " to equip it to "Red Nova Dragon" and grant it the ability to inflict  Piercing  damage. Primo activates his face-down " Wise G3 " in order to send "Wisel Guard" to the  Graveyard  and  Special Summon  " Wisel Guard 3 " ( 3/0/2000) in Defense Position.
 A replay occurs and Jack uses "Red Nova Dragon" to attack "Wisel Guard 3". Due to the latter's effect, it is not destroyed, however "Red Nova Dragon" then inflicts piercing damage to Primo (Primo 4000 → 500). The effect of " Infinite Aura " activates (Aura Counters of "Infinite Aura": 40 → 75). Primo's hand contains "Infinity Guard Formation". Primo then activates his face-down " Echo Mirror " to  draw a card  and reveal it. If it's a  monster , Jack will take damage equal to the monster's Level times 300 damage. Primo draws " Wisel Attack 3 ", which is Level 3 (Jack 2000 → 1100). Jack sets a card. At this point, Primo intends to finish Jack off, but Jakob mentally convinces Primo to follow their plan.
 Turn 8: Primo 
Primo draws. During the Standby Phase, the effect of "Speed World 2" activates (Jack's SPC: 6 → 7; Primo's SPC: 6 → 7). Primo  Sets  two cards.
 Turn 9: Jack Atlas 
 Yusei  tells Jack to destroy "Infinite Aura". Jack draws. During the Standby Phase, the effect of "Speed World 2" activates (Jack's SPC: 7 → 8; Primo's SPC: 7 → 8). Jack sets a card.
 Jack activates his face-down " Synchro Sonic " to destroy "Infinite Aura" (as he controls at least one  Synchro Monster ), but Primo activates his face-down " Infinity Guard Formation " to  negate  the effects of all Effect Monsters he controls and negate the effect of "Synchro Sonic" ("Meklord Emperor Wisel": 2500 → 0/0). "Red Nova Dragon" attacks and destroys " Meklord Emperor Wisel " (Primo 500 → 0). Since "Meklord Emperor Wisel" has been destroyed, "Wisel Top", "Wisel Attack", "Wisel Guard 3", and "Wisel Carrier" are destroyed by its effect. The effect of "Infinite Aura" activates ("Infinite Aura's" Aura Counters: 75 → 80). Primo activates the effect of " Infinite Prison " in order to take "Wise Core" from his Graveyard and set it in his  Spell & Trap Card Zone  as a  Spell Card  by discarding "Wisel Attack 3".
 Due to the rulings of the WRGP, it immediately goes to Jack's End Phase. Primo passes the baton to Jakob proceeds in Dueling Jack with all the cards that Primo had on his field.
 
 Jack Atlas vs. Jakob 
 Turn 10: Jakob 
Jakob draws " Grand Core ". During the Standby Phase, the effect of " Speed World 2 " activates (Jack's SPC: 8 → 9; Primo's SPC: 8 → 9). Jakob Normal Summons "Grand Core" ( 1/0/0) in  Defense Position . Jakob then activates his face-down " Explosive Blast " to  destroy  "Grand Core" and inflict 400  damage  to Jack (Jack 1100 → 700). Since "Grand Core" was destroyed by a card effect and sent to the Graveyard, its  effect  activates, Special Summoning " Meklord Emperor Granel " ( 1/0/0) in Attack Position, " Granel Top " ( 1/500/0) in Attack Position, " Granel Attack " ( 1/1300/0) in Attack Position, " Granel Guard " ( 1/500/1000) in Defense Position, and " Granel Carrier " ( 1/700/700) in Attack Position. Due to the effect of "Meklord Emperor Granel", its  ATK  and DEF become equal to  Jakob 's Life Points ("Meklord Emperor Granel": 0 → 4000/0 → 4000). [Notes 1] 
 Jakob then activates " Speed Spell - Takeover " to destroy "Infinite Aura" and gain  Life Points  equal to the number of counters it had x 100. (Jakob 4000 → 12000) ("Meklord Emperor Granel": 4000 → 12000/4000 → 12000). Jakob  Sets  a card. "Meklord Emperor Granel"  attacks  "Red Nova Dragon", but  Jack  activates the latter's third effect to  remove it from play  and allow Jack to negate one attack, but as "Granel" is attacking, Jakob activates the effect of "Granel Top" to  negate  the effects of one Synchro monster on Jack's field until the End Phase. He negates the effects of "Red Nova Dragon" ("Red Nova Dragon": 5500 → 3500/3000). "Meklord Emperor Granel" then destroys "Red Nova Dragon" (Jack 700 → 0).
 Since "Meklord Emperor Granel" destroyed a Synchro Monster in battle, Jakob activates the effect of "Granel Attack" to take "Red Nova Dragon" from the Graveyard and equip it to "Meklord Emperor Granel". Due to the effect of "Meklord Emperor Granel", it gains ATK equal to the ATK of "Red Nova Dragon" ("Meklord Emperor Granel": 12000 → 15500/12000).
 Due to the rulings of the WRGP, it immediately goes to Jakob's End Phase. Jack passes the baton to  Crow Hogan  who proceeds in Dueling Jakob with all the cards that Jack had on his field.
 
 Mistakes

 In the English version, when  Jakob  Summons " Granel Top ", " Meklord Emperor Granel " was shown again instead of  Granel Top . 
 In the English version, when Jack's " Synchro Sonic " resolves, it is shown to be " Infinity Guard Formation ". 
 In the English version, Jakob calls " Explosive Blast " " Attack Cannon ". 
 In both versions, when  Primo  activated the effect of "Infinite Prison" to discard one card from his hand, " Wisel Attack " was shown instead of " Wisel Attack 3 ". 
 In the English version, When Jack returns " Red Nova Dragon " to the field, it shows it Level 10 when it's actually Level 12. 
 In the English version when  Jakob  summoned " Granel Guard ", its level was shown to be Level 10 instead of Level 1. 
 In the English version, when Jack's Life Points drop to 0, they are first shown to be 600 instead of 700. 
 In the original Yusei wondered what effect " Infinite Aura " had while looking at Bruno's computer, however Bruno's computer showed the text on the card just before he says this. 
 When the explanation for Mecklord Emperor Granel started it showed the card Mecklord Emperor Granel Infinity instead of Mecklord Emperor Granel.
