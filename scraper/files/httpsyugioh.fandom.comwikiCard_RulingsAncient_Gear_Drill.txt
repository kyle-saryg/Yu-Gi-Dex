 Previously Official Rulings 
   These TCG rulings were issued by  Upper Deck Entertainment  and have since been deemed unofficial by Konami. [1]  They were previously considered official and can still be correct, as long as they follow the official gameplay rules, or unless Konami has issued a ruling that says otherwise. References:  [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] 
 
 You must show your chosen card to your opponent to verify that it is a  Spell Card . 
 You can select a  Field Spell Card  but you must  Set  it in your  Field Zone . 
 If you get a  Spell Card  with “ Ancient Gear Drill ” and then return it to your  hand  with “ Giant Trunade ”, restrictions no longer apply so you can use it as normal. 
 Out of Date 
 “You cannot use that  Spell Card  this turn” means that you cannot  activate  it, and you cannot use it to  pay  a  cost  for  Summoning  “ Anteatereatingant ” or for the effect of a card like “ Emergency Provisions ” or “ Elemental Hero Tempest ”. [Notes 1] 
 Mentions in Other Rulings 
 Ojamagic : If you select " Ojamagic " for the effect of " Ancient Gear Drill ", and it is  destroyed  that same turn, you cannot  activate  " Ojamagic's " effect. [Notes 1] 
 
 
 
 Notes 
 
 ↑  1.0   1.1   The latest errata of "Ancient Gear Drill" only states that the Spell Card cannot be activated, not that it cannot be used.
