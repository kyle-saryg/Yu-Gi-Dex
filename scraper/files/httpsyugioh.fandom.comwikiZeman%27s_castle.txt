      Zeman's castle.     
 Zeman's castle  is a grim hilltop structure in the  Duel Monsters Spirit World .  Zeman the Ape King  resided here, while he was in power.
 
 Role in the Minus Curse 
       The portal     
 The building served as a key location for casting the  Minus Curse . Inside the throne room is a large portal. The portal could be used to cast large scale Minus Curses. While performing one, a large beam is emitted from the castle. Its strength comes from the souls of Duel Monster spirits, he has already minus'd. Such spirits are sealed in stone slabs, which line his walls. The slabs resemble the spirit's corresponding Duel Monster cards, but with a  negative Level .
 Inside it was  Ancient Fairy Dragon's  prison, where Zeman had the dragon sealed in stone, but was unable to completely minus her.
 
 Zeman's fall 
 When the  Signer   Luna  came to the spirit's world in order to free  Ancient Fairy Dragon , she along with  Torunka  and  Regulus  infiltrated the castle, disguised as traveling magicians, who had captured Regulus and were bringing him to Zeman.
 They tried convincing Zeman that he must first unseal the Dragon, then seal both her and Regulus in order to completely minus her. Zeman initially falls for this and begins to unseal Ancient Fairy Dragon.
 After Torunka accidentally blows their cover, Zeman begins to quickly reseal Ancient Fairy Dragon before she is freed. However Regulus asks Luna for the  Cursed Needle  as he plans to counter Zeman's negative energy with his staff. Zeman and army of monkeys are destroyed as both staffs negative power become positive resulting in a blast that destroys some parts of the castle. Some effects of the curse are undone, but the spirits remain imprisoned on stone tablets.
 Once Luna and  Leo  defeat the  Dark Signer ,  Devack , Torunka, who remains in the castle, informs the now freed spirits that Luna has saved them.
