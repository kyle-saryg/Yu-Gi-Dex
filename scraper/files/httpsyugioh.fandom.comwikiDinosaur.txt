 Dinosaur  (Japanese:  恐 竜   Kyōryū ) is a type of monster that primarily relies on  beatdown  tactics and sometimes  Monster effects , to help a Duelist prevail in a  Duel . There are many high-level Dinosaur- Type  monsters, so the general strategy for them is to Summon their high-Level monsters as quickly as possible using cards like " Hunting Instinct " or " Big Evolution Pill ", overpowering the opponent's weaker monsters before they have a chance to defend themselves. Dinosaurs are predominantly  EARTH - Attribute  monsters (most of those that are or resemble Pterosaurs are  WIND ), but the release of the " Jurrac " Archetype led to a surge of  FIRE  Dinosaur-Type monsters, continued with the " Evolsaur " archetype, " Number 61: Volcasaurus ", and " Pyrorex the Elemental Lord ". Dinosaur cards are most notably played by  Rex Raptor ,  Tyranno Hassleberry ,  Scorch  and  Chills ,  George Gore  and  Kan Hakubutsu .
 In the  Falsebound Kingdom , Dinosaur-Type monsters are treated as  Dragon -Type monsters.

 Playing style 
 Dinosaur-Type monsters are rivaled by few (including extremely powerful  Nomi  monsters, high- Level   Fusion Monsters , or  Dragons ) in terms of overwhelming brute force and attack strength. They possess the first (and for a long time only and still the only non-" Kaiju ") monster that completely breaks the  rule of 3000 ATK , " Super Conductor Tyranno "; their  Field Spell Card  " Jurassic World " grants a higher ATK and DEF bonus than any other for specific Monster Types; and they have a powerful searcher, " Fossil Dig ", a Spell Card that can add any Level 6 or lower Dinosaur-Type monster from the Deck to the  hand . They also possess an  Elemental Lord  monster, " Pyrorex the Elemental Lord ". In addition, Dinosaurs can search monsters through " Miracle Jurassic Egg ", which builds up counters to be Tributed for a big Dinosaur-Type monster, or " Babycerasaurus ", which combos well with " Torrential Tribute " or " Dark Hole ". Unlike other Monster Types in which high-Level monsters risk being useless in the hand, Dinosaur-Type monsters have numerous options for getting around Tribute requirements that make high-Level monsters the bread and butter of the Deck. Dinosaurs and Dinosaur support also have a few powerful field clearing cards, most notably " Jurrac Meteor ", " Volcanic Eruption ", and " Jurrac Impact ".
 Jurrac , the first Dinosaur archetype, was released in  Duel Terminal - Demon Roar God Revival!! ,  Duel Terminal - Champion of Chaos!! ,  Duel Terminal - Dragunity of the Hurricane!! , and  Duel Terminal - Charge of the Genex!!  in the  OCG , while the  TCG  received them in in  Hidden Arsenal 2 ,  3 , and  4 . Jurracs focus on battle and low-Level Special Summons, and encompassed all Dinosaur-Type  Tuners  and  Synchro Monsters  prior to the introduction of the  Dinowrestler  archetype. 
 Evol  is a multi- Type  archetype that contains the Dinosaur-Type " Evolsaur " monsters. The  Reptile -Type " Evoltile " monsters Special Summon ('evolve into') " Evolsaur " monsters, triggering the  Evolsaur  effects. For example, if an "Evoltile" monster 'evolves' into " Evolsaur Diplo ", it can destroy an opponent's Spell/Trap Card. The Dinosaur-Type "Evolsaur" monsters are primarily used as  Xyz Materials  for the  Xyz Summon  of Dragon-Type " Evolzar " monsters. For example, " Evolzar Laggia " requires 2  Level 4  Dinosaurs, and it can detach both its  Xyz Materials  to negate and destroy a Spell, Trap, Normal Summon, or Special Summon.
 One unique Dinosaur-Type monster, " Tyranno Infinity ", gains a massive 1000 ATK boost for each banished Dinosaur-Type monster, making Dinosaur-Type monsters viable even with the debilitating effects of " Macro Cosmos " and related cards. " Tyranno Infinity " also works extremely well with " Survival Instinct ", " Miscellaneousaurus ", and " Spacetime Transcendence "; such a combo can end games in one blow if used at the right time. " Babycerasaurus " or " Petiteranodon " can be combined with " Skull Lair " to simultaneously recruit and power up "Tyranno Infinity".
 The release of the  Dinosmasher's Fury Structure Deck  provides and expands on two avenues of focus for Dinosaur-Type monsters in addition to their primary strategy of Summoning high-Level monsters; generating advantage through destroying their own cards, and  Normal Monster  support. Both have served as downplayed plays in the past.

 Dino-Rabbit 
 The release of " Evolzar Laggia " and " Evolzar Dolkka " provided two powerful control monsters for Dinosaur-Type decks to access. The most successful of these, and the first competitive, was Dino-Rabbit. 
 " Rescue Rabbit " can Summon two Level 4 Normal Dinosaurs from the Deck to Xyz Summon either " Evolzar Laggia ", which can negate the Summon of a monster or the activation of a Spell/Trap Card, or " Evolzar Dolkka ", which can negate the activation of monster effects. Through the use of either " Kabazauls " or " Megalosmasher X ", the Deck can also access the " Bahamut Shark "/" Toadally Awesome " combo for further negation.
 " Tour Guide from the Underworld " can also be used to make either " Leviair the Sea Dragon ", (allowing for the swift retrieval of "Rescue Rabbit") " Number 17: Leviathan Dragon ", " Wind-Up Zenmaines " or " Number 20: Giga-Brilliant ".

 True King Dinosaurs 
 The effects of " Babycerasaurus " and " Petiteranodon " allow a player to rapidly swarm the field with Level 4 Dinosaurs if triggered reliably, which can be accomplished using the effects of the " True King " monsters; primarily the  EARTH  " True King Lithosagym, the Disaster ", as destroying the EARTH "Babycerasaurus" and "Petiteranodon" will allow the effect of "Lithosagym" to be used as its strongest. The Deck's  Field Spell Card , " Dragonic Diagram ", allows the player to destroy a card in their hand or field to search out a "True King", thereby generating excellent advantage.
 The Summoned Dinosaurs can be used as  Xyz Material  to  Xyz Summon  " Evolzar Laggia  and " Evolzar Dolkka ", and later used to fuel the effect of " Miscellaneousaurus " or to  Special Summon  the Deck's Dinosaur boss monster: " Ultimate Conductor Tyranno ", which can flip all monsters the opponent controls face-down, attack all monsters they control, and send face-down monsters that it battles to the Graveyard before damage calculation, while inflicting 1000 damage for each.
