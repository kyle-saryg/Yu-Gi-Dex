 " An Imperfect Couple: Part 1 ", known as " A Fierce-Battle Couple Duel - "That Anna Chick" and I Are a Tag!? " in the Japanese version, is the ninety-second episode of the  Yu-Gi-Oh! ZEXAL  anime. It first aired in Japan on February 24, 2013 and in the United States on January 11, 2014.
 Today is  Heartland Academy 's Cultural Festival.  Yuma 's class are busy with the "Monster Cafe". A gloomy look crosses the faces of  Tori  and  Cathy , who were enjoying dressing up as monsters until that wild, trouble-making girl,  Anna  ran into Yuma. As if at almost perfect timing,  Ray  shows up, mentioning a " Couples Duel tournament ". When Anna hears that the opponent is a Pro Duelist Dueling Couple, she forces Yuma to form a team with her.

 Featured Duel: Yuma Tsukumo and Anna Kaboom vs. Brooke and Mayday Walker 
         
 Turn 1: Mayday  
 Mayday   draws . He then activates the  Field Spell Card  " Iceberg Ocean ". Now the  DEF  of all  face-up   Defense Position   monsters  will be reduced to 0 while "Iceberg Ocean" is face-up. Mayday then activates " Balloon Party ", which  Special Summons  two " Balloon Tokens " ( 1/0/0 for each) in Attack Position. He then  Tributes  the "Balloon Tokens" in order to  Tribute Summon  " Indestructible Airship Hindenkraft " ( 10/2900/2000) in Attack Position. Mayday  Sets  a card.
 Turn 2: Yuma 
 Yuma  draws. He then Normal Summons " Gogogo Golem " ( 4/1800/1500) in Attack Position and Sets two cards.
 Turn 3: Brooke 
 Brooke  draws. She then activates " Raft Party ", which Special Summons two " Raft Tokens " ( 1/0/0 for each) in Attack Position. Brooke then Tributes the "Raft Tokens" in order to Tribute Summon " Unsinkable Titanica " ( 10/2800/3000) in Attack Position. As a  Level  5 or higher monster was Normal Summoned, Mayday activates the  effect  of "Indestructible Airship Hindenkraft" to switch all Level 9 or lower monsters the opponent  controls  to Defense Position; "Gogogo Golem" is switched to Defense Position ("Gogogo Golem": 1500 → 0 DEF). 
 Brooke activates the effect of "Unsinkable Titanica" to  destroy  "Gogogo Golem" (as it now has 0 DEF) and inflict damage to Yuma equal to half its  ATK  (Yuma: 4000 → 3100 LP). As a single monster was destroyed by a card effect, Yuma activates his  face-down  " Puzzle Reborn " to revive "Gogogo Golem" ( 4/1800/1500) in Attack Position. Brooke Sets a card [Notes 1] .
 Turn 4: Anna 
 Anna  draws. She then Normal Summons " Night Express Knight " in Attack Position without Tribute via its own effect, at the cost of reducing its ATK to 0 ( 10/3000 → 0/3000). Anna then activates " Southern Stars " to change the Level of "Gogogo Golem" to 10 ("Gogogo Golem":   4 → 10). Anna then  overlays  "Night Express Knight" and "Gogogo Golem" in order to  Xyz Summon  " Superdreadnought Rail Cannon Gustav Max " ( 10/3000/3000, ORU: 2) in  Attack Position . 
 Anna activates the effect of "Superdreadnought Rail Cannon Gustav Max" to  detach  an  Overlay Unit  ("Superdreadnought Rail Cannon Gustav Max": 2 → 1 ORU) and inflict 2000  damage  to her opponent. She chooses to inflict the damage to Brooke, but Mayday activates his face-down " Engagement Destiny " to halve the effect damage Brooke takes and take damage equal to the halved amount (Brooke & Mayday: 4000 → 3000 LP). Anna Sets a card.
 Turn 5: Mayday  
Mayday draws. He then overlays "Indestructible Airship Hindenkraft" and "Unsinkable Titanica" in order to Xyz Summon " Skypalace Gangaridai " ( 10/3400/3000, ORU: 2) in Attack Position. Mayday then activates the effect of "Skypalace Gangaridai" to destroy "Superdreadnought Rail Cannon Gustav Max" and inflict half its ATK as damage to Anna by detaching an Overlay Unit ("Skypalace Gangaridai": 2 → 1 ORU) (Anna: 4000 → 2000 LP). "Skypalace Gangaridai" attacks Yuma  directly .
 Duel continues in  the next episode .
