      The Bakura fanclub; members C, B, A, D, E, F (from left to right) [1]     
 The  Bakura fanclub  ( 獏 良 ファンクラブ  Bakura fankurabu ) [1]  is a group of six girls in  Yu-Gi-Oh! The Dark Side of Dimensions , who obsess over  Ryo Bakura .
 In the English dub, the line of dialogue for member "C", "I baked you these.", was given to the female New York winner of the  4K Media Inc. voiceover contest , Brooke Stocken. [2] 
 
 History 
 One morning, five of the girls crowded around Bakura, offering him gifts, while Bakura was overwhelmed by their presence. [3] 
 At the mall, after hearing the news of people mysteriously vanishing, Bakura thought it would be hard to enjoy his food, knowing someone out there is probably watching him. But  Anzu Mazaki  said that the people watching him are probably harmless and gestured towards the six girls, who were spying on him behind a pillar. [3] 
 In the English dub,  Yugi Muto  and  Tristan Taylor  (Hiroto Honda) claimed that it is Bakura's accent that gets the girls every time. [3]
