 Biography 
 At one point in the past,  Axel's father  fell into a coma after losing a  Shadow Duel . Axel enrolled in the American Duel Academy in response in an attempt to uncover the truth. There, many other  Duelists  fell unconscious and Axel began to suspect  David Rabb  of being the culprit. [2]   Principal MacKenzie  selected Axel as one of five students that would accompany him to the main branch of  Duel Academy  to participate in a tournament. [3]  When they arrive, MacKenzie urges all of them to enjoy themselves. [4]  Hearing of  Chazz Princeton 's  Duel  with David, after which David fell unconscious himself, Axel would seek out the footage from the Duel. [5] 
 The round of tournament matches consisted of  Tag-Team Duels . Axel was selected to team with  James Crocodile Cook  against Chazz and  Syrus Truesdale . [6]  Though the two worked well together, they ultimately lost to the Japanese students. [7]  The tournament moved to singles matches next, and Axel was selected to Duel Chazz. The Duel took place at the cliff. Axel asked Chazz what exactly happened during his Duel with David and also told him of his father's condition. Chazz agreed to reveal all he knew of the incident if Axel defeated him, as he was hesitant to trust him, but later determined that he was after the same thing that Chazz was - the truth. [2] 
 
       Axel overtaken by  Tragoedia .     
 Chazz gained the advantage in the Duel, but Axel Summoned " The Blazing Mars ", a  Legendary Planet  given to him by MacKenzie. Seeing darkness emanating from the  monster , Chazz believed himself to be in another Shadow Duel.  Tragoedia  possessed Axel at this point, telling Chazz that it wasn't a Shadow Duel, but that the Duel must be finished. [8]  Tragoedia reduced Chazz to 100  Life Points  by  Tributing  four " Machine Tokens " with the  effect  of "Mars". His attack was stopped by " Durability (Dragon's Endurance) " and victory is lost when Chazz Summons the  Feather of Ma'at  - " Light and Darkness Dragon ". Knowing that he is weak to it, Tragoedia left Axel to be defeated before the attack hits. Axel had no memory of what had just happened, only that he felt another presence in his body. When queried by Chazz, he cannot remember where he obtained "Mars" from in the first place. [9]  Tragoedia took "Mars" back from Axel and rendered him unconscious when his usefulness was at an end. [10]  Years later, Axel attended a  Pro League  event, where  Jaden Yuki  Dueled  Koyo Hibiki . [11]
