 Yokai  ( 妖 怪   Yōkai ) is a  Type  of  Monster Card  in the  Yu-Gi-Oh! GX  manga . They were used by  Bastion Misawa  and are based on  Yōkai  creatures from Japanese folklore.
 Bastion is the only character to play Yokai-Type monsters, and only in the  Yu-Gi-Oh! GX  manga. The Yokai's core strategy consists of  Special Summoning  Yokai from the  Graveyard , which triggers their  effects . Besides effects that allow the user to Special Summon their Yokai from the Graveyard, Yokai monsters and related cards also often have effects that  send  monsters to the Graveyard (like " Gozuki "), or that benefit from having Yokai monsters on the Graveyard (like " Enma's Judgment ").
 When the Yokai-Type monsters were released in the  TCG / OCG , they were changed to be  Zombie -Type monsters, making Yokai a Type exclusive to the manga.
 
 Example 
 
 Trivia 
 In the manga, when Bastion and  Chazz  dueled in volume 2, Bastion once referred to his own Monster cards as being Zombie-Type instead of Yokai-Type. (But this occurred only in one scene during the duel, so it may be just an error made by the editors since the OCG/TCG releases of Bastion's cards are changed to Zombie-Type.)
