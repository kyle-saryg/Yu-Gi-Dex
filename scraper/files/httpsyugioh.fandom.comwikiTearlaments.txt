" Tearlaments " are an archetype of mostly  DARK   Aqua -type monsters introduced in  Power of the Elements .
 
 Etymology 
 "Tearlaments" is a portmanteau of "tear", "tiara", "lament" and "firmaments"; each card's name is derived from a word used to describe grief or sorrow. Thematically, the monsters and their names are based on different types of mermaids.
 
 Playing Style 
 "Tearlaments" focuses on sending cards from the Main Deck to the GY to trigger other "Tearlaments" card effects, which activates when the "Tearlaments" card is sent to the GY by a card effect. By sending " Tearlaments Merrli ", " Tearlaments Havnis " or " Tearlaments Scheiren ", you would be able to Fusion Summon by shuffling the sent card and other Fusion Materials from the hand, field and/or GY on the bottom of the Deck. " Tearlaments Reinoheart " is a key card that can send a "Tearlaments" card of your choice when summoned, as compared to just sending from the top of the Deck. The "Tearlaments" Trap cards offer additional disruption when activated and adds more "Tearlaments" to the hand when sent by a card effect.
 The style of sending cards with card effects and Fusion Summoning synergize very well with the " Shaddoll " archetype as both archetypes have many in common and "Tearlaments" can add additional starting plays to the "Shaddoll" deck.
