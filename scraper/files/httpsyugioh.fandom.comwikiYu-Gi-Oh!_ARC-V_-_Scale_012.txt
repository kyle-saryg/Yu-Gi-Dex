 Summary 
   This summary is currently incomplete. 
 As  Yuzu  looks on in concern for  Yuya's  well being,  Yugo  is struggling in his  Turbo Duel  against  Ren  as he summons " Clearwing Fast Dragon " to overtake the masked Turbo Duelist. But Ren's skills with a  Duel Runner  cause Yugo to lose his cool and nearly gets himself killed when he lost control of his ride and drove off a cliff. Luckily, Yuya's conscious indirectly saved Yugo as he quickly has his dragon destroy Ren's " White Aura Dolphin ". But Ren counters by using his "Reincarnation Synchro" to summon White Aura Dolphin back to the field so he can use it and " White Moray " to  Synchro Summon  " White Aura Whale ". 
 Watching his dragon get destroyed, Yugo is at wits' end when he hears Yuya's voice that spurs a memory of himself at a younger age and being cheered on during a race by another boy his age: Yuya. Coming to, Yugo quickly negates Ren's attack on his Life Points by playing his Trap " Synchro Panic ", which Summons " Speedroid Passing Rider " and " Speedroid Domino Butterfly " back to his field and ends Ren's attack phase. However, through it canceled out Ren's Reincarnation Synchro strategy, Yugo's trap prevents either player from Synchro summoning for three turns as Ren uses " Synchro Zone " to render Yugo unable to attack him with his non-Synchro monsters. The Turbo Duel soon reaches its next lap: Yuya's heart.
 
 Featured Duel: Yugo vs. Ren 
 Duel continues from the previous Scale . 
 Turn 3: Yugo 
 Yugo  manages to get back into the lane with  Yuya 's help, allowing him to continue his  turn .
 He  attacks  and  destroys  " White Aura Dolphin " with " Clearwing Fast Dragon " (Ren: 4000 → 1000 LP). Since "Dolphin" was destroyed and  sent  to the  Graveyard ,  Ren   activates  its  effect ,  banishing  one " White Moray " from his Graveyard to  Special Summon  "Dolphin" back as a  Tuner monster . Yugo  Sets  a card. During the  End Phase , the effect of " Follow Wing " wears off, returning the  ATK  of "Clearwing" to normal ("Clearwing": 3000 → 2500 ATK).
 Turn 4: Ren 
Ren obtains an  Action Card . He activates the effect of "White Aura Dolphin", attempting to halve the ATK of "Clearwing", but Yugo  chains  the effect of "Clearwing",  negating  the effect of "Dolphin" and reducing its ATK to zero ("Dolphin": ATK 2400 → 0). Ren activates the  Continuous Spell Card  " White Salvation ", allowing him to  add  one "White Moray" from his Graveyard to his  hand , which he subsequently  Normal Summons . Ren tunes his  Level  2 "Moray" with his Level 6 "Dolphin" to  Synchro Summon  " White Aura Whale " (2800/???). As it was Special Summoned the effect of "Whale" activates, destroying all  monsters  Yugo  controls , but Yugo activates the Action Card " Protective Wind ", negating the effect. Ren activates the Action Card " Against the Wind ", switching "Clearwing" to  Defense Position  and reducing its  DEF  by 1000 ("Clearwing": DEF 2000 → 1000).
 Ren attacks and destroys "Clearwing" with "Whale", with the latter's effect inflicting  piercing   battle damage  (Yugo: 2700 → 900 LP). As "Clearwing" was destroyed, Yugo activates his  face-down  " Synchro Panic ", allowing him to Special Summon its  Synchro Materials , " Speedroid Domino Butterfly " and " Speedroid Passing Rider " from his Graveyard in  Attack Position . Since "Whale" destroyed a monster  in battle , its effect allows it to attack once again. Ren attacks "Domino Butterfly", but the effect of "Passing Rider" forces Ren to attack it instead. The effect of "Synchro Panic" prevents the destruction of "Passing Rider" (Yugo: 900 → 300 LP). Ren activates his face-down " Synchro Zone ". As long as it is face-up, the attacks of any non- Synchro Monster  will be negated. Ren Sets a card.
 Duel continues in the next Scale .
