 Appearance 
 In comparison to the other "Earthbound Immortals", "Ccapac Apu" is a gigantic black humanoid figure rather than a particular animal. Like the other "Immortals", it has a secondary color; blue. "Ccapac Apu" has a simple dome-like, neckless cyclopean head with a blue circle outline rather than an eyespot, short stalks on the back of its head, and tiny stalks on the backs of its hands and fingers.
 
 Biography 
 History 
 Earthbound Immortal Ccapac Apu was one of the  Earthbound Immortals  who participated in the battle with the  Crimson Dragon  5,000 years ago, where it was defeated and sealed in the Giant  Nazca Line . It is presumed that it serves  Red Nova .
 Ccapac Apu's  Mark of the Shadows  resurfaced 5000 years later, choosing  Kalin Kessler , who bore a grudge against  Signer   Yusei Fudo , as its host. It appeared to Kalin as he was starving to death from depression in  Sector Security  custody, and asked what his desire was, warning him that he would have to serve as a  Dark Signer . Kalin stated that his desire was for vengeance, and died, becoming a Dark Signer with "Ccapac Apu" as his "Immortal".
 
 Dark Signers 
 Kalin  Summoned "Ccapac Apu" during his first  Turbo Duel  with  Yusei , marking the first widely known time that an " Earthbound Immortal " had been Summoned for 5000 years, powering it with the captive souls of the citizens of  Satellite . "Ccapac Apu" almost defeated Yusei, but Yusei's  Duel Runner  was damaged before the attack could connect, and Kalin called the Duel off in amusement, calling "Ccapac Apu" back to the Netherworld.
 Kalin once again Summoned "Ccapac Apu" during his second Turbo Duel with Yusei, but this time, Yusei was able to resist its attacks with " Stardust Dragon ". As Kalin drew Yusei's attack to "Ccapac Apu" to prevent Yusei from exploiting its weakness, the movements of "Ccapac Apu" almost threw him off course, causing Yusei to attempt to save him. Yusei proceeded to use the power of the  Crimson Dragon  to  Synchro Summon  " Majestic Star Dragon ", which negated the effects of "Ccapac Apu" and used its own abilities against it, before destroying it. "Ccapac Apu" fell in a shower of souls, disappearing back to the Netherworld.
