         Schroeder Corp office     
 Schroeder Corp  is a company run by  Zigfried von Schroeder . This company is exclusively mentioned in the  KC Grand Championship  arc. It is headed by Zigfried, who seized power when the former CEO went mad. It changed to a gaming corporation roughly when  KaibaCorp  did, even inventing plans for a  Battle Box-esque  virtual dueling system, though they were too late to present the idea to  Industrial Illusions , as  Kaiba Corp  had already presented their plans for  Dueling Arenas . In  Yu-Gi-Oh! 5D's , they are mentioned as a sponsor of the  WRGP . Their headquarters is located in Germany.
