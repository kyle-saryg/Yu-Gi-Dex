 " Double Duel!! " is the thirty-seventh chapter of the  Yu-Gi-Oh! ZEXAL  manga . 
 This chapter was first printed in Japanese in the 2/2014 issue of  V Jump , released on December 21, 2013, and in English in the 12/23/2013 issue of  Weekly Shonen Jump .
 Kyoji  gathers the  Numbers Hunters  in the  Heartland New Tower  planning to finish the  Numbers War , while he executes his plan to open a gate to the  Astral World .  Luna  and the  Numbers Club  team up in order to stop his plans, while a double  Duel  of Numbers Hunters takes place:  Yuma  vs.  Kaito  &  Shark  vs. Kyoji!
 
 Summary 
 In the  Heartland New Tower  Red Stadium,  Yuma  and  Astral  are shocked to see that  Kaito  is their opponent. In the stands, the  Numbers Club  are likewise surprised that Yuma is the special Duelist for the day. Yuma asks Kaito if  Kyoji Yagumo  forced him into this, but Kaito doesn't respond. Yagumo's voice comments from Yuma's  D-Pad  that they might say that, but it isn't quite true; Kaito is on his team now. Yuma asks what he means, and Yagumo replies that Kaito decided to help him collect the " Numbers ". Yuma protests that Kaito was fighting Yagumo. Astral realizes that Yagumo has taken  Haruto  hostage, and Yagumo appears on the screen of Yuma's D-Pad, telling them that they've guessed correctly, commenting that if they refuse the Duel, he cannot guarantee Haruto's safety. Yuma starts insulting Yagumo, but Yagumo ignores him, asking if they should get started; it's Kaito and Yagumo against Yuma and  Shark . The doppelganger of  Mr. Heartland  announces what the crowd have all been waiting for; the reigning champion is appearing in Blue Stadium. He states that the champion's Deck is cloaked in mystery and its true power is unknown - it's Kyoji Yagumo! 
 Yagumo appears on screen, waving to the crowd with a friendly grin. Astral realizes who the other Duelist is as Heartland introduces him; the challenger is a former hero exiled from the Dueling world, but today he makes a comeback. What sort of Duel will they see from this former hero once known as the prince of  WATER  monsters? Ryoga Kamishiro! Yuma cries Shark's name, as the Heartland doppelganger announces the day's main event; the double Duel of the century! Yagumo asks Shark what he thinks, and Shark irritably replies that this seems a little over-the-top. Yagumo describes it as the party to end all parties. 
 In Shark's hideout,  Luna  sees the event on-screen, and when she realizes what the monument in between the twin towers of Heartland New Tower is she can barely believe it. In the stands,  Tokunosuke  is confused, asking someone to tell him what is going on.  Tetsuo  suddenly gets a message on his  Duel Gazer  from Yuma, attracting  Kotori's  attention, and he tells Yuma that they're on it. Outside Heartland,  Cologne  complains about Yuma leaving her behind and she wonders where he went. Something suddenly speeds past her; it's Luna, hidden under her cloak. Recognizing Luna from her time with  Dr. Faker , Cologne tries to play dead, causing them both to sweatdrop. Luna picks Cologne up, recognizing her and commenting that this is perfect timing. She asks if Cologne is with Yuma and if she recognizes the monument from Dr. Faker's lab. Cologne panics, protesting that she's just a doll that looks like Princess Cologne. The Number Club show up, blowing Cologne's cover, and Kotori asks who Luna is. Luna introduces herself, explaining that she is Ryoga's partner. Kotori protests that Shark is on the Dueling field now, and Luna replies that she knows, stating that there is no time. She needs their help to stop the monument.  Takashi  asks what is wrong with it, and Luna explains that it opens a door to another world. If activated,  Heartland City  faces annihilation. Luna states that Kyoji Yagumo is plotting something terrible. Kotori protests that they have to find Haruto, and Tetsuo explains that they got a call from Yuma, asking them to find Haruto as Yagumo was holding him hostage, and that was why Kaito had switched to Yagumo's side. Luna immediately suggests that they split up and find him. Tetsuo takes charge, ordering Kotori,  Cathy  and Takashi to go and find Haruto, while the rest of them will stop that device. The Numbers Club move out, leaving Luna and Cologne standing. 
 Yuma deploys his D-Pad, asking if he will be facing Kaito and Shark facing Yagumo in a double Duel. Astral wonders if Kyoji Yagumo is planning something, and Yuma asks what it could be. Astral explains that right now all the "Numbers" are in these two arenas, and Yuma realizes that Yagumo wants to settle it all right there and now. Astral nods in agreement and comments that it would appear that way; this is the final battle in the  Numbers War . Kaito meanwhile is thinking to himself that whatever the reason, he, Yuma Tsukumo, and Astral have a score to settle. Yuma protests that he can't believe they're fighting Kaito, but Astral reminds him that they have no choice. Kaito tells Yuma, "let's do this", and he engages  Photon Change  and both players ready their D-Pads, Yuma his Duel Gazer, and Kaito his tattoo with a declaration of "Duel!"
 The Heartland doppelganger announces the beginning of the Duel in Red Stadium and Kaito goes first, declaring his turn and drawing a card. He Summons " Photon Advancer " with 1000  ATK  and then  Special Summons  another from his hand since he already controls a "Photon Advancer". Then he activates their effects, making the ATK of each "Photon Advancer" he controls the sum of the two, and thus both "Photon Advancers" rise to 2000 ATK. Astral notes the two monsters with at least 2000 ATK each as Kaito  Releases  both monsters,  chanting  "Descend, incarnation of light!  Galaxy-Eyes Photon Dragon !" Yuma is shocked to see "Galaxy-Eyes" is already in play, as Kaito ends his turn.
 Yuma declares his turn and draws. Astral advises Yuma to by them some time so that Tetsuo and the others can change the situation. Yuma agrees, and Summons " Gogogo Dexia ", which bursts out of the ground with zero ATK. Kaito is surprised to see a zero ATK monster, and Yuma activates a  Spell Card , claiming that there's more to his monster than that. " Golem's Clap " allows him to Special Summon " Gogogo Aristera " from his hand, another zero ATK monster. Then he activates their effects, switching them into  Defense Position . The two hands clap as they stand with 2200  DEF  each, as Yuma explains that his opponent can no longer attack  EARTH  monsters. Yuma  Sets  a card and ends his turn. Kaito notes that they're preventing him from attacking with a monster effect, and Yuma replies that even "Galaxy-Eyes" can't attack now, and this will prevent it from using its exclusion effect too. 
 
         Kaito  Summons " Galaxy Eyes Full Armor Photon Dragon ".     
 Kaito muses that he sees that they came prepared to fight "Galaxy-Eyes", but he vows to win the Duel for Haruto's sake. He equips to  Equip Spell Cards  to "Galaxy-Eyes", " Galaxy Shot " and " Galaxy Barrier ". Yuma states that it's pointless to beef "Galaxy-Eyes" up if he can't attack, and Kaito asks if Yuma is sure about that. He declares that this is a trump card that he's never shown anyone, and he  overlays  "Galaxy-Eyes" and the two Equip Cards. Astral and Yuma are shocked, and Yuma asks if that is even possible. Kaito chants, "At the end of the Milky Way's light, a new world opens! Descend, scion of divinity! Armored  Xyz Summon ! Come forth, new incarnation of light!  Galaxy-Eyes Full Armor Photon Dragon !" Astral gasps that it's a new  Xyz Monster .
 
 Featured Duel: Yuma Tsukumo vs. Kaito Tenjo 
 Turn 1: Kaito 
 Kaito   Normal Summons  " Photon Advancer " (1000/???). Since he  controls  a "Photon Advancer", he  Special Summons  a second one from his  hand , and both gain 1000  ATK  (1000 → 2000). Kaito  Tributes  his two  monsters  with 2000 or more ATK to Special Summon " Galaxy-Eyes Photon Dragon " (3000/2500) from his hand.
 Turn 2: Yuma 
 Yuma  Normal Summons " Gogogo Dexia " (0/2200) and  activates  " Golem's Clap ", Special Summoning " Gogogo Aristera " (0/2200) from his hand. Since both "Dexia" and "Aristera" are on the  field , they both are changed to  Defense Position , and prevent Kaito from  attacking   EARTH  monsters. Yuma  Sets  a card.
 Turn 3: Kaito 
Kaito  equips  "Galaxy-Eyes" with " Galaxy Barrier " and " Galaxy Shot ". He then uses "Galaxy-Eyes" and his two  Equip Spell Cards  as  Overlay Units  to  Xyz Summon  " Galaxy-Eyes Full Armor Photon Dragon " (4000/3500) from his  Extra Deck  via its own  effect .
 Duel continues in  the next Rank .
