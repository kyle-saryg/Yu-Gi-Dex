 Personality 
 "Utopia" is the only " Number " that is cooperating with  Yuma  and  Astral  by its own free will, proven by the fact that it was the only one who did not side with  Number 96 . [1] [2]  However, its power will corrupt any other  Duelist  who uses it as the way other "Number" cards do. [3] [4] [5] 
 He was willing to protect Astral and was very concerned when Yuma was struggling to control " Number C32: Shark Drake Veiss " during Yuma's Duel with  Shark . [6]  He would come out from the  Emperor's Key  to assist Yuma whenever he was in trouble. [7] 
 
 Biography 
       Utopia lineart     
 Number 39's  card  was the sole " Number " to remain in  Astral 's possession after his memories were lost, a  blank card  at the time. During  Yuma 's Duel with  Shark , the blank card took the form of "Utopia" based on Yuma's desires and became his  ace monster . [8] 
 Utopia became Yuma's favorite "Number", using it in most of his Duels and refers to him more personally than most of his other monsters, as shown when Yuma screams out of frustration when "Utopia" was defeated by " Black Ray Lancer ". [9]  During Yuma's Duel with  Kaze ,  Roku  notices that "Utopia" has a special power. [10]  During Yuma's Duel with  Fortuno , "Utopia" was given a  Chaos  form known as " Number C39: Utopia Ray ". [11] 
 While Yuma confronted  Dextra  and  Nistro  during the  WDC ,  Number 96  appeared within  Emperor's Key  to confront Astral. Astral asked if he broke the seal, and Number 96 responded by saying that's what the "Numbers" wanted to begin with. Astral questioned why the other "Numbers" gave their strength to Number 96, who responded once more that it's what all "Numbers" want - the world's destruction. He claimed that Astral also wanted the same. Neither being seemed to notice that although the other numbers' pillars were all glowing, Utopia's remained dark. [1] 
 
       Utopia confronts  Number 96  in  Emperor's Key .     
 Astral denied it, but Number 96 pointed out his very presence as proof against that. He told Astral to remember his mission and join the "Numbers". He assaulted Astral, but was fended off by Utopia, which surprised both of them. Number 96 asked if Utopia meant to stand against them, and concluded that he'll just start by absorbing him first. He then continued his assault via the use of his own card. [1] 
 
       Utopia attacks with "Rising Sun Supreme Slash"     
 Astral realized Yuma needs help so he ordered Utopia to stop protecting him and go help Yuma. Utopia looks at Astral worried, but decides to obey. Number 96 tried to stop him; however Utopia managed to escape and go to Yuma. During the Duel, Yuma and Astral, who managed to defeat Number 96, used " Double or Nothing! " and " Double Tension " with "Utopia", which allowed him to use a new attack they called "Rising Sun Supreme Slash" ("Hope Sword Mars Slash" in the original). [2] 
 
           Utopia looking concerned.     
 During Yuma's Duel against Shark in the semi-finals, Utopia looked very concerned for Yuma when he struggles to control " Number C32: Shark Drake Veiss ". [6] 
 
         Utopia slays  Vetrix 's malice from  Hart .     
 He is later summoned when Yuma and Astral enter  Hart Tenjo 's consciousness as  Vetrix 's hatred appears in the form of a dark dragon, causing Hart to be in pain. Utopia battles and slays Vetrix's hatred, causing Vetrix's control over Hart to fade.  [12] 
 During the Duel with  Fender , Utopia left the key to help Yuma. [7] 
 In the Duel with  Number 96 , when Astral revives Utopia, Yuma says that he is the first bond made by him and Astral, and that he is always there to give them hope. [13] 
 Eliphas  referred to "Utopia" as an irregular "Number" when Yuma summoned him in their Duel. [14] 
 During Yuma's Duel with  Don Thousand , Utopia and his four other forms appeared to deliver the "Final Hope Sword Slash" to " Number iC1000: Numeronius Numeronia ". 
 In Yuma's last Duel with  Nash , Nash  Xyz Summoned   CXyz Barian Hope , who relentlessly used all of the effects of the " Number C10Xs ", which in turn, heavily damaged Utopia. When Utopia was revived, all of his other forms appeared for the summoning of " Number 39: Utopia Beyond ".
 His last appearance was in Yuma's Duel with Astral, with Astral successfully summoning out five of his forms during his turn.
