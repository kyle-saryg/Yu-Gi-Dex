 Summary 
 Bastion Misawa  is up early, and stands on the shorelines, thinking that the  Shadow Riders  have been inactive recently ever since  Camula 's  defeat , and that the next one will likely soon come. He vows that they won't take his  Spirit Key . He opens his jacket and takes out one of his Decks, and begins thumbing through it. He finds " White Magician Pikeru " in it, and comments that he doesn't recall putting it in there. He then looks around uneasily, then complains that the card is a silly distraction. He then says that nothing distracts him. Later, he goes to the  Slifer Red  dorm and wakes  Jaden Yuki ,  Syrus Truesdale  and  Chumley Huffington  using his " Barrel Dragon " card. He has them do early morning drawing exercises, and Chumley noticed Syrus has " Thunder Nyan Nyan ", which he describes as his "card crush" (idol card in the Japanese version). Chumley has one as well - " Dian Keto the Cure Master ". This angers Bastion, but he realizes that he too has one - "White Magician Pikeru".
 In class, it is observed that there are many students absent. It's revealed that they (and  Dr. Crowler ) are hard at work building a coliseum in the forest at the behest of  Tania , who reveals herself as the third Shadow Rider. The remaining Spirit Key holders and Syrus and Chumley journey to the coliseum. Tania states she doesn't Duel women, so  Alexis Rhodes  cannot Duel her.  Professor Banner  attempts to hide, so she needs to chose between Jaden, Bastion and  Chazz Princeton . She settles on Bastion, and states that she doesn't want his soul - she wants his hand in marriage if she wins. Bastion chooses to use his  EARTH  Deck, while Tania tells Bastion she has two Decks - Knowledge and Courage. She allows him to choose, and he chooses the Knowledge Deck.
 Eventually, Tania wins using her " Amazoness " cards and uses her pet tiger, Bass, to chase the remaining students out of the coliseum, leaving her alone with Bastion as night falls.
 
 Featured Duel: Bastion Misawa vs. Tania 
 Turn 1: Tania 
Tania draws " Amazoness Swords Woman " and subsequently Normal Summons it (1500/1600) in  Attack Position . She then  Sets  a card.
 Turn 2: Bastion 
Bastion draws " Magnet Warrior Σ＋ " and subsequently Normal Summons it (1800/1500) in Attack Position. "Magnet Warrior Σ＋" attacks and destroys "Amazoness Swords Woman". Due to the latter's effect, Bastion takes all the Battle Damage that Tania would have taken (Bastion 4000 → 3700). Since an Amazoness monster Tania controls was destroyed and sent to the Graveyard, Tania activates her face-down " Pride of Tribe " to  Special Summon  another "Amazoness Swords Woman" (1500/1600) from her  Deck  in Attack Position. Bastion then Sets a card.
 Turn 3: Tania 
Tania draws. She then Normal Summons " Amazoness Blowpiper " (800/1500) in Attack Position. Bastion activates his face-down " Magnet Force Minus ", equipping it to "Blowpiper" and treating it as a  Minus monster . Due to the last effect of "Magnet Force Minus", Tania must use "Amazoness Blowpiper" to battle "Σ＋" when she enters her Battle Phase as Bastion controls a  Plus monster . Tania then activates " Amazoness Spellcaster " to swap the original ATK of "Amazoness Blowpiper" and "Σ＋" ("Amazoness Blow Piper": 800 → 1800/1500; "Magnet Warrior Σ＋": 1800 → 800/1500). "Amazoness Blowpiper" attacks and destroys "Σ＋" (Bastion 3700 → 2700). "Amazoness Swords Woman" attacks directly (Bastion 2700 → 1200). On Tania's End Phase, the effect of "Amazoness Spellcaster expires ("Amazoness Blowpiper": 1800 → 800/1500).
 Turn 4: Bastion 
Bastion draws. He then activates " Magnet Conductor Plus " to add "Magnet Warrior Σ＋" from his  Graveyard  to his  hand . Bastion then sends "Magnet Warrior Σ＋" and " Magnet Warrior Ω－ " from his hand to the Graveyard in order to Special Summon " Conduction Warrior Linear Magnum ± " (2700/1300) in Attack Position. Bastion then Sets two cards. "Magnum Plus Minus" attacks "Amazoness Blowpiper". Due to the effect of "Magnum ±", it gains ATK equal to half the ATK of "Amazoness Blowpiper" ("Conduction Linear Magnum ±": 2700 → 3100/1300). "Magnum ±" destroys "Amazoness Blowpiper" (Tania 4000 → 1700). On Bastion's End Phase, the effect of "Magnum ±" expires ("Conduction Linear Magnum ±": 3100 → 2700/1300).
 Turn 5: Tania 
Tania draws. "Amazoness Swords Woman" attacks "Magnum ±". Tania intends to use the effect of "Amazoness Swords Woman" to make Bastion take all the Battle Damage that she will take from the battle between "Magnum ±" and "Amazoness Swords Woman". Bastion then activates his face-down " Power Off " to send "Magnum ±" to the Graveyard and Special Summon "Ω－" (1900/600) and "Σ＋" (1800/1500) from the Graveyard in Attack Position. A replay occurs and Tania chooses not to attack. Tania then Normal Summons " Amazoness Paladin " (1700/300) in Attack Position. Due to the effect of "Amazoness Paladin", it gains 100 ATK for each Amazoness monster Tania controls. Tania currently has two ("Amazoness Paladin": 1700 → 1900/300). Tania then Sets two cards.
 Turn 6: Bastion 
Bastion draws " Magnet Warrior Σ－ " and subsequently Normal Summons it (1500/1800) in Attack Position. He then activates his face-down " One Hundred Thousand Gauss " to decrease the ATK of "Amazoness Paladin" by 800 ("Amazoness Paladin": 1900 → 1100/300). Since a card that targets an Amazoness monster has been activated, Tania activates her face-down " Dramatic Rescue " to return "Amazoness Paladin" to her hand and Special Summon " Amazoness Tiger " (1100/500) from her hand in Attack Position. Due to the second effect of "Amazoness Tiger", it gains 400 ATK for each Amazoness monster Tania controls. Tania currently has two ("Amazoness Tiger": 1100 → 1900/500). Due to the last effect of "Amazoness Tiger", Bastion is forbidden from attacking any other Amazoness monster besides "Amazoness Tiger". 
 Bastion formulates a strategy that will assure him victory. He will first attack "Amazoness Tiger" with "Ω－" which will cause a  Double KO . He will then attack "Amazoness Swords Woman" with "Σ－" which will cause another Double KO. Finally he will attack directly with "Σ＋". "Ω－" attacks "Amazoness Tiger", but Tania activates her face-down " Amazoness Archers " to decrease the ATK of every monster Bastion controls by 600 ("Ω－": 1900 → 1300/600; "Σ－": 1500 → 900/1800; "Σ＋": 1800 → 1200/1500) and force them all to battle. "Amazoness Tiger" destroys "Ω－", "Σ－", and "Σ＋" (Bastion 1200 → 600 → 0 → 0).
 
 Differences in Adaptations 
 Several scenes are removed in the international version. 
 While Barrel Dragon's weapons were altered, Dian Keto's artwork was strangely left uncensored.
