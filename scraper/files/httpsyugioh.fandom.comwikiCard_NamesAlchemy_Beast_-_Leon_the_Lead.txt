 In the Arabic anime dub, this card was called (وحش الكيمياء - الأسد الرصاصيّ) literally  Chemistry Beat - Lead Lion . 
 In the American Spanish dub this card was mistakenly translated to " Bestia de Alquimia - León Líder " (lit.  Alchemy Beast - Leader Lion ). Its Spanish name is more accurate, as it was translated as " Bestia de Alquimia - León de Plomo " (" Alchemy Beast - Lead Lion ").
