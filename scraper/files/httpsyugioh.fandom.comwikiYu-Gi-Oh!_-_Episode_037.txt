 Summary 
 Yugi  and  Yami Yugi  devise a plan to counter Pegasus'  Millennium Eye  by repeatedly switching control of Yugi's body each turn. They will not even tell each other what cards they place on the  field , making Pegasus unable to figure out their strategies. 
 When Yugi destroys Pegasus' " Toon World " and his monsters, Pegasus decides to take the  Duel  up a notch by sending it to the  Shadow Realm .
 Meanwhile,  Tristan  and  Bakura  are cornered in the dungeon, and Bakura uses " Man-Eater Bug " to attack Pegasus's guards and sends them to the  Graveyard  with " Morphing Jar ". Tristan realizes that Bakura is really the spirit of the  Millennium Ring  from  previously , and Bakura reveals that he wants to use  Mokuba 's body for himself. He threatens Tristan, saying that if he doesn't give him up, he will kill him like he did the guards.
 
 Featured Duel: Yami Yugi/Yugi Muto vs. Maximillion Pegasus 
 
 This article  may require  cleanup  to meet this wiki's standards.   You can help out by re-organizing or re-writing parts of it or checking grammar and spelling.   
 
 This Duel uses  Duelist Kingdom  gameplay. Rules and  card effects  may differ from that of the  TCG / OCG . See the individual card articles for more information.     
 Duel continues from the previous episode . 
 Yami Yugi  has 900  LP  remaining and  controls  no cards. 
 Pegasus  has 2000 LP remaining and controls " Toon Mermaid " (1400/1500), " Manga Ryu-Ran " (2200/2600) and " Toon Summoned Skull " (2500/1200) all in  Attack Position , " Toon World ", " Gorgon's Eye ", and no Set cards.
 Turn 15: Yugi/Yami Yugi 
Yami  Normal Summons  " Dark Magician " (2500/2100) in Attack Position. He then  activates  " Magical Hats " to hide "Dark Magician" within 1 of 4 "Hats". Pegasus then tries to find out the location of "Dark Magician" by reading Yami Yugi's mind. At this point, both Yami Yugi and  Yugi Muto  realize that the  Millennium Eye  is giving Pegasus too big of an advantage. Yami Yugi decides to do a "Mind Shuffle" with Yugi in order to prevent Pegasus from knowing which cards Yami Yugi/Yugi Sets  face-down .
 Turn 16: Pegasus 
Pegasus draws. He then releases "Toon Summoned Skull" from "Toon World". "Toon Summoned Skull"  attacks  and  destroys  the "Hat" that Yami had been thinking of, believing that is the hat that "Dark Magician" is hiding in, but that hat turns out to be empty because Yugi had already selected a new location for "Dark Magician". (In the dub, the location is unchanged. Instead, the attack fails because the location of "Dark Magician" went away with Yami.) Pegasus returns "Toon Summoned Skull" back into "Toon World".
 Turn 17: Yugi/Yami Yugi 
Yugi  draws  a card (" Mirror Force ") and subsequently Sets it. Pegasus tries to read Yugi's mind to find out what the Set card was, but Yugi switches back to Yami Yugi, who doesn't know what the Set card is, so Pegasus doesn't find out what the Set card is.
 Turn 18: Pegasus 
Pegasus draws. He then releases "Toon Summoned Skull" from "Toon World". "Toon Summoned Skull" attacks and destroys a "Hat", but it's empty. Pegasus returns "Toon Summoned Skull" back into "Toon World".
 Turn 19: Yugi/Yami Yugi 
Yami Yugi switches back to Yugi. Yugi draws " Living Arrow " and subsequently Sets it. Yugi then switches back to Yami Yugi.
 Turn 20: Pegasus 
Pegasus draws " Magical Neutralizing Force " and subsequently activates it, destroying the remaining "Hats" and revealing "Dark Magician". Pegasus releases "Toon Summoned Skull" from "Toon World". 
 "Toon Summoned Skull" attacks "Dark Magician", but Yami Yugi switches back to Yugi, who activates his face-down "Living Arrow" to  target  "Magical Neutralizing Force" for its effect. Yugi then switches back to Yami Yugi, who uses "Living Arrow" to destroy "Toon World" and "Gorgon's Eye". Since "Toon World" was destroyed, all of Pegasus's  monsters  that were affected by "Toon World" are returned to their 'normal' versions: " Red Archery Girl " (1400/1500), " Ryu-Ran " (2200/2600) and " Summoned Skull " (2500/1200). Yami Yugi then switches back to Yugi, who activates his face-down " Mirror Force " to reflect the attack of "Summoned Skull" back at Pegasus's monsters, destroying every monster on Pegasus's side of the  field  in Attack Position and inflicting  damage  to Pegasus equal to the  ATK  difference between the reflected attack and each of the destroyed monsters (Pegasus: 2000 → 600 LP). At this point, Pegasus turns the  Duel  into a  Shadow Game .
 Duel continues in the next episode . 
 
 Differences in adaptations 
 When  Pegasus  tells  Yami Yugi  that it doesn't matter about playing " Magical Hats " because he can just read Yugi's mind so he knows where the " Dark Magician " is hidden, cut from the dub is a shot of the hats turning transparent, revealing where the "Dark Magician" is. 
 A shot of Yugi next to  Yami Yugi  is added over the white lights when Yugi calls to Yami Yugi in the dub, and then when Yami Yugi says that he feels that Pegasus is trying to read their minds, Pegasus and the  Millennium Eye  are added over the white lights. 
 The guns in the guard's hands are removed in the dub, and a shot of the guards shooting " Man-Eater Bug " is removed. 
 " Magical Neutralizing Force " is redesigned in the dub. 
 In the dub, Téa has a voice over talking about how Yugi can't attack or defend because of Pegasus's "Toon World" and "Gorgon's Eye" cards. 
 The sequencing in the dub shows the conversation between Yugi and Yami before Pegasus has "Toon Summoned Skull" attack and Yugi says he doesn't know where the "Dark Magician" hides, whereas in the original, Pegasus attacks first and finds that Yugi switched the hiding place of the "Dark Magician". 
 Cut from the dub is the explanation of Yami Yugi given to Joey and Tea by Yugi when Joey asks what's going on because Pegasus mentions Yugi's "other mind". 
 In the original, this is the first time Yugi and Yami Yugi talk to each other, whereas in the dub they first spoke to each other in  episode 29  during their duel against  Mai . 
 Cut from the dub is the flashback conversation that Yugi and Tea have about Yugi saying that he feels that there is another presence inside of him. 
 Cut from the dub is Yami Yugi's speech about a duelist's intuition because Pegasus has been relying mostly on his Millennium Eye.
