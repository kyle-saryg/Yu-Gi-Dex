 Pegasus Crawford  is the  Yu-Gi-Oh! The Duelists of the Roses  incarnation of  Maximillion Pegasus .  He is a member of the White Roses and located at  Lancashire . He also claims to answer to the name of  Thomas Stanley , who was the step-father of Henry VII (played by Yugi) historically. Pegasus does act out the crucial role of betraying Richard III in support of Henry VII.
 
 Deck 
 Pegasus Crawford plays a  Toon  Deck. Among his strategies, he uses the Toon  terrain  to increase the ATK of his monsters and lower the ATK of many other monsters. He often plays  Trap Cards  on the Toon terrain to protect his Deck Master and lower the ATK of the player's monsters even more to take advantage of said terrain. If the player places a monster next to their Deck Master, Pegasus often activates " Brain Control " or " Change of Heart " to temporarily take control of that monster and attack the player's Deck Master directly with it. Pegasus can often win the Duel without attacking, as he has copies of " Tremendous Fire " that can each inflict 1000 damage and " Mimicat ", which can recycle them. His Ritual Cards are considerably weaker than his more powerful cards, such as " Toon Summoned Skull " and " Manga Ryu-Ran ".
