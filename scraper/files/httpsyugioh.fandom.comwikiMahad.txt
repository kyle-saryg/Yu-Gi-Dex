 Personality 
 Mahad was a kind and compassionate man with a deep sense of loyalty. He was considerably patient in his role as  Mana 's instructor in the magical arts, though at times was known to become frustrated at her reluctance to take her teachings seriously. Mahad is also very selfless, looking out for the well being of others before his own. 
 One of his most notable traits was that of his unwavering loyalty towards his childhood friend,  Atem , whom he served faithfully and with strong conviction. In addition, he seemed to have had a close relationship with  Isis . 
 
 Etymology 
 The name Mahad is a male Muslim name of Arabic origin, meaning "one who is great". His Japanese name, "Mahado", can likely be translated to "magical wave", hinting his use in Spellcaster monsters such as "Illusion Magician". 
 
 Biography 
 Childhood 
 As a child, during the time when  Aknamkanon  was Pharaoh, he,  Atem , and  Mana  were good friends. Mahad himself was of noble lineage and was tasked with guarding and protecting the prince. At one point, he got bitten by a snake, and Atem saved him by sucking the venom out.
 
 Priesthood 
 Mahad later became a  High Priest  serving  Pharaoh Akhenamkhanen  as the wielder of the  Millennium Ring . Additionally, Mahad was an extremely powerful magician, eventually taking on  Mana  as his apprentice. As the wielder of the Millennium Ring, Mahad was able to sense a great evil within it, leading him to uncover the  truth  behind the creation of the  Millennium Items . Upon this discovery, Mahad approached Pharaoh Akhenamkhanen and informed him of this. Akhenamkhanen was then overcome with guilt and fell ill sometime later. Upon his death, Akhenamkhanen's young son,  Atem , succeeded him as king. 
 
 Millennium World 
 Mahad fought  Thief King Bakura  when he raided the palace alongside  Atem  and the other priests. Bakura later fled when Atem summoned " Obelisk the Tormentor ". He later led Bakura to the  Valley of the Kings . He and Bakura entered a tomb, where he had sealed his power, and his men blocked off the entrance so that Bakura can't flee. However, during the fight, despite obtaining the great power, he sacrificed himself to fuse his  ka  and  ba  together to form " Dark Magician " after he was severely weakened. He then made a blast so powerful that Bakura was believed to have died. He continued to serve Atem as the Dark Magician, and even destroyed Bakura's  Diabound  during their fight at  Kul Elna . He participated in the final battle aganist  Zorc Necrophades , when the latter began his assault on the palace. He and the  Dark Magician Girl , Mana's  ka , attempted to destroy Zorc with a combined attack but Zorc was unaffected and easily wiped them out. Mahad's soul was among others waiting for Atem in the afterlife. 
 
 Abilities 
 As one of the  Sacred Guardians , Mahad was the wielder of the  Millennium Ring , which granted him access to a various number of abilities, including, but not limited to, initiating  Shadow Games  and summoning spirit monsters known as  Ka . 
 A secret known only to a select few, Mahad was one of the most powerful magicians among the members of the Pharaoh's court, being extremely well-versed in the ways of magic and sorcery, as well as having an extensive knowledge of magical spells. At some point, Mahad sealed a portion of his power within a tomb, whose location would remain disclosed.
