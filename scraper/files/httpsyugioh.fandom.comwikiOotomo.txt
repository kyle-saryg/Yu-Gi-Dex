 Biography 
 Pre-Arc League Championship 
 Ootomo,  Kakimoto  and  Yamabe  met up with Sylvio at the LID Center Court when the latter invited the  You Show Duel School  students over. At Sylvio's request,  Yuya  let Ootomo and the other two see " Stargazer Magician " and " Timegazer Magician ". Sylvio then claimed the cards as his, and challenged Yuya to a duel. On Sylvio's cue, Ootomo grabbed  Allie ,  Frederick  and  Tate , and held them hostage. Sylvio lost the duel, and ordered his friends to take Yuya's  Pendulum Monsters  by force, but  Sora Perse  knocked them out with his lollipop. [2] 
 A few days later, Ootomo and Yamabe met up with Sylvio inside a warehouse near the port, having bought his favourite food for him. Then, when  Zuzu  busted the warehouse door open and Sylvio choked on his food, Ootomo handed him a bottle of water. He and Yamabe then witnessed  a masked duelist  intrude the warehouse and unwittingly challenge Sylvio in Zuzu's place. Sylvio lost the duel and was knocked unconscious; Kakimoto and Yamabe carried Sylvio out of the warehouse, with Ootomo following behind them.  [3]  The next day, he, Kakimoto and Yamabe told  Gong Strong  about the attack on Sylvio, and accused Yuya of committing the attack. This lured out Skip Boyle and Yuya in front of You Show Duel School, with the others following; the three lackeys revealed that Zuzu bore witness to the attack. Eventually,  Henrietta Akaba  arrived at the school, leading Skip and their students back to LID;  Claude  stayed behind to give prize cards to Kakimoto, Yamabe and Ootomo for backing their story.   [4] 
 
 Arc League Championship 
 Kakimoto, Yamabe and Ootomo were seen watching Sylvio's rematch with Yuya at the Arc League Championship, and were impressed by Sylvio's new Pendulum Monsters.  [5] 
 
 Duel Academy 
 After  Z-ARC 's defeat and the  Standard Dimension  being reborn into the  "Pendulum Dimension" , Ootomo was seen watching  Yuya Sakaki 's Duel against  Jack Atlas  with  Kakimoto  and  Yamabe . [6]  He cheered when Yuya won and watched Yuya and  Declan 's  Action Duel . [7]  He was happy when Yuya won the Duel and witnessed  Zuzu 's revival. [8]
