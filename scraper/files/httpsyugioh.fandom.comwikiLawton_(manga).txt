 Biography 
 Lawton appeared in a flashback of  Yusei 's, from before his meeting with  Sect . One day, Lawton showed up along with a friend. Noticing Yusei's  Duel Runner , he challenged him to a  Turbo Duel . Yusei kept quiet for a moment, and Lawton teased him, asking if he's afraid of his " Gatling Ogre  Deck". Yusei explained that he only desires to face strong Turbo Duelists; Yusei pointed out that Lawton previously lost a Turbo Duel to his friend, so he would face Lawton's friend in a Turbo Duel instead, making Lawton get mad at him.
 Some time later, after Yusei became " Satellite 's strongest Duelist", he came to Lawton's group and challenged him to a Turbo Duel; however, neither Lawton nor any of his friends accepted the challenge, saying that they were no match for Yusei and that they wouldn't become his opponent only to satisfy his pride.
 Some time later, Yusei saw Lawton defeating  Sect Ijuin  in a Turbo Duel. When Sect noticed Yusei, he recognized he was "Satellite's strongest Duelist" and challenged him to a Duel. Lawton mocked Sect, saying that he had no chance against him.
 Yusei is shown to have become friends with Lawton and his gang some time after meeting Sect. [1]
