 Biography 
 Not much is known about this team. In the anime, the " Hook the Hidden Knight " card was given to them by  Primo . They use this " Card of Darkness " to escape from the slums. During the WRGP preliminary rounds, Team Catastrophe dueled against  Team Unicorn  and won after they used "Hook the Hidden Knight" to lock  Andre 's and  Jean 's Duel Runner's wheels and make them crash. They also made  Akiza  crash while she was training, and were soon revealed to have been the culprits behind  Crow's  injury that made him unable to participate against Team Unicorn. During their WRGP duel with  Team 5D's  they revealed a second  Card of Darkness  after Crow manages to overcome "Hook the Hidden Knight" and prevent Team Catastrophe from using it any further after Hermann loses. However, their strategy failed and they ironically lost after Nicolas' Duel Runner was destroyed. Since Nicolas couldn't drive his Duel Runner back to the pit to hand off the flag to Hans, it resulted in an automatic defeat. 
 They all have criminal marks, with  Hermann  having two.

 Trivia 
 They were the only team in the WRGP who didn't use their third Wheeler on-screen, didn't defeat a single Wheeler in their duel against Team 5D's, and didn't duel against Yusei. Also their duel was the shortest of the competition, with just 2 episodes, which is what normally takes a regular duel in the anime. 
 This is the only team in the  WRGP  that does not have their  captain  as the last wheeler.
