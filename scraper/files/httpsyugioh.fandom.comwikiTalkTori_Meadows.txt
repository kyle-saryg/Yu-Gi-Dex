 Name 
 I changed the page name to Tori Meadows, since it's her dub name. Or at least, Toonzaki confirmed that on his Facebook. (Source:  http://www.facebook.com/Toonzaki/posts/240303516021409#!/Toonzaki )  Get your   game on!  17:26, September 28, 2011 (UTC)
 
 update 
 Maybe this page could use a serious update?  Justin Holland  ( talk  •  contribs ) 02:19, November 19, 2013 (UTC)
