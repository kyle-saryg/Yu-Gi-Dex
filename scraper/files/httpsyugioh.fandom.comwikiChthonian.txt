 "Chthonian"  is a  series  of cards with the word "Chthonian" in their English card names. In the  OCG , these cards had " Hell " 「地獄」 in their Japanese names, but not all "Hell" cards belong to this series. They were used by  Chazz Princeton  in the  Yu-Gi-Oh! GX  anime. The cards are thematically similar in art style and often utilize a control/beatdown strategy.
