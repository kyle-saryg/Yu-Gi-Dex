 Action Duels have become a global sensation, but what is he dark secret behind them that threatens to destroy the world? [1] 
 Turbo Duel!! 
 Yuya is an ace Duelist, but his past is a broken memory even he cannot recall. The fact that he has four separate personalities makes things even more complicated! Now the Leo Corporation is on the hunt for the Genesis Omega Dragon, the card that will decide the fate of the world. Is the secret of this card somewhere within Yuya's memories? [2] 
 
 Story 
 Solid Mass with vision has plunged the world into the era of Action Duels. The Duelists of the Leo Corporation are in hot pursuit of Yuya Sakaki, a Dueltainer who can hack that technology. The Leo Corporation's first assassin, Sawatari, squares off against him only to discover that the person he is chasing is someone else—a guy who introduces himself as Yuto! However, during the duel, Yuto transforms into Yuya, who wins and escapes. Yuzu Hiragi, who happens to be present at the Duel, becomes Yuya's manager and joins him in pursuit of the Genesis Omega Dragon (G.O.D.) Then the second assassin, Kurosaki, takes Yuzu's father, Shuzo, hostage and Yuya ends up dueling him. After winning, Yuya tells Yuzu and her father that he has four personalities! [2]

 Message from Shin Yoshida 
 Yuya, Yuto, Yuri and Yugo… Finally they're all here, and the mystery surrounding this quartet kicks off! Look forward to both the mystery and the Duels! [2] 
 
 Message from Naohito Miyoshi 
 What would I do if I had three additional personalities? Yuto would handle the rough layouts, Yugo would ink and Yuri would add the finishing touches! Heh heh heh… Huh? Me? I'd sleep like a log :-) [2] 
 
 Message from Masahiro Hikokubo 
 Sometimes, I fantasize about a project called Yu-Gi-Go!, in which you can get all the cards all over town, and cafés and game centers are Duel Fields, and you can unlock rare packs by walking around a lot!! Um, sorry about that… [2]
