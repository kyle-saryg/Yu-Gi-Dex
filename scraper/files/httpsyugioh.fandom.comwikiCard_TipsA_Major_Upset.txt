 This card can be searched by " A Cat of Ill Omen ", " Trap Trick " and " Lilith, Lady of Lament ". 
 Use this card to return Level 7 or higher  Fusion Monsters  and  Synchro Monsters  to the  Extra Deck , as well as Level 7 or higher  Ritual Monsters  and  Nomi  monsters to the hand (depending on how easily they can be summoned). 
 Tribute a monster whose Level was reduced to 2 by " Falling Current ", or a Level 2 or lower monster that can reach high ATK (such as " Copycat ", " King of the Skull Servants " or " Goblin King "). 
 Tribute a monster summoned by " Graceful Revival " on the same turn. 
 If a monster that would be returned can easily be summoned again, have " Degenerate Circuit " face-up so that the monster is banished instead.
