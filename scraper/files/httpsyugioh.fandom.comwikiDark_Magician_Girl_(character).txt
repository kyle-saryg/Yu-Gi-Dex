 Design 
         Dark Magician Girl's design incorporates multiple layers of clothing and a wide range of expressions. Depicted here is the character in full regalia from front and rear views and closeup views of her head and hand.     
 Dark Magician Girl's outfit is similar to that of  Dark Magician , except that it is mainly blue and pink with a few touches of yellow. She has blonde hair, green eyes, blushed cheeks, and wields a wand that matches her outfit. In dubbed versions of the anime and cards, her bust is reduced by erasing cleavage lines, her hexagram is replaced with a red jewel (the Millennium Item symbol in Yu-Gi-Oh! GX Tag Force) and she sometimes wears a shorts under her skirt.
 Her outfit is composed of an off-the-shoulders garment that extends to her upper-thighs and ends up as a pink skirt. It is blue with pink trimmings and a few touches of yellow. Her hat is pointed, like Dark Magician's, except it is blue, along with pink rings and a pink spiral on one side. She wears boots reaching halfway up her thighs, and her wand, which is blue, has a spiral which is similar to the one on her hat, except that it is yellow. She wears optional pink and blue gauntlets.
 In the manga, in Ancient Egypt, she had tanned skin, similar to that of  Mana .
 
 Biography 
 Yu-Gi-Oh! 
 Battle City 
 Dark Magician Girl first appears as a character in the  Battle City  arc when Yugi faces the ex-magician  Arkana , whom she defeats by drawing power from both Duelists'  Dark Magician  cards. One of Yugi's most expressive monsters, she also appears in the  Duel  between  Yugi Muto  and  Bakura Ryou , and is seen crying when she was forced to attack by the effect of Bakura's " Dark Spirit of the Silent ", which caused her  owner  to be damaged by the effects of " Dark Sanctuary " (implying that she actually  knew  that she was chosen by the effect and what would happen).
 
 Virtual World 
         Dark Magician Girl supporting  Téa as her Deck Master in the duel against Crump.     
 When  Crump  of  The Big Five  decides to battle  Téa , she chose Dark Magician Girl as her  Deck Master , whose ability allowed her to telepathically communicate with Téa and help her when she needed it. She also worried for her since she was an amateur Duelist and Crump pushed her into a corner. As a last resort, Dark Magician Girl volunteered to be Summoned though Crump points out she's only a threat if Dark Magician was out, which reveals Téa never put him in her deck (in the dub, Téa initially refused to Summon her because if she was destroyed, she'd automatically lose, but agrees to it). Téa then used her full ability, which was to empty her  Graveyard  of all her destroyed monsters so she could draw 4 cards from the top of her deck, one of which was " Sage's Stone " which allowed her to Summon "Dark Magician" from Yugi's Deck nearby. Both monsters then attacked with "Dark Magician" destroying Crump's " Defender Iceberg " while Dark Magician Girl attacks Crump directly, winning Téa the Duel.
 
 Waking the Dragons 
 Her character was shown much more clearly during the  Waking the Dragons  arc. She brought  Yugi  and  Yami Yugi  to the World of Duel Monsters to revive the  Legendary Dragon   Timaeus  to help them to fight  Doma . She did the same with  Kaiba  and  Joey  who gained the dragons,  Critias  and  Hermos .
 When  Dartz  summoned the  The Great Leviathan , Dark Magician Girl opened a portal to the  Duel Monsters Spirit World  and led an attack against the Leviathan with Yugi, Kaiba and Joey. After the evil beast is defeated, she and the  Legendary Knights  help all the stolen souls from " The Seal of Orichalcos " to return to their bodies and thanks Yugi and Yami for saving both the human world and Duel Monsters Spirit World.
 
 Dawn of the Duel 
         Dark Magician Girl next to  Mana     
 In the  Dawn of the Duel  arc, Dark Magician Girl is the  Ka  monster of  Mana . After  Mahad  died and became the  Dark Magician , Mana promised herself that she would become a great magician, following after her teacher.
 
 Yu-Gi-Oh! GX 
         Dark Magician Girl gives  Syrus Truesdale  a kiss goodbye.     
 In  Yu-Gi-Oh! GX , Dark Magician Girl appears as a Duel Spirit during the  Duel Festival . On the one day Duel Spirits can take physical form, the Dark Magician Girl surfaces during a school-wide festival to duel with  Jaden Yuki  after finding out that  Syrus Truesdale  had planned a Costume Duel for that day. After Jaden laments that he has no one to duel once  Alexis Rhodes  chases off her brother for taking a picture of her in costume and trying to send it to their family, the Dark Magician Girl shows up and tells Jaden that he can have a duel with her. With the exceptions of Jaden, Syrus, and  Chazz Princeton , nobody thought that she was the real Dark Magician Girl because everyone was in Duel Monsters costumes. Syrus harbors feelings for her, and Jaden considers her a formidable opponent.  Bastion Misawa  pointed that Dark Magician Girl should have been in  Yugi Muto 's Deck. The crowd cheered actively for her, and even though she lost, she didn't care because she had so much fun. Before the day ended, she used the last of her energy to give Syrus a kiss on the cheek and then she went back into her card.
 
 Yu-Gi-Oh! 3D Bonds Beyond Time 
         3D Bonds Beyond Time, alongside her master     
 When Dark Magician Girl was Summoned by the effect of " Bond Between Teacher and Student ", she acts very childish and became worried when she saw  Paradox 's monsters.  Dark Magician  encourages her that victory can be assured when they join forces with their master.
 
 
 Other appearances 
 In  Yu-Gi-Oh! The Falsebound Kingdom , when Dark Magician Girl arrives late, Dark Magician became furious and tells his student not to make any excuses. When Yugi asks who she was, Dark Magician Girl will say she is Dark Magician's number one student, Dark Magician says that she was a inexperienced student called back from her training. He will ask Yugi to put her in the bottom of the roster. She then joins the party.
