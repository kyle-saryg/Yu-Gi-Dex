 Prior 
 Joey has a nightmare about  Seto Kaiba  beating him in the duel from last night but wakes up.
 In the morning of the second day of the  Duelist Kingdom  tournament,  Yugi Muto  finds a note left by  Mai Valentine  saying she will leave for a while but be back in time for the finals of the tournament. Unbeknownst to them, they are being spied on by three duelists who are working for  Bandit Keith , who is out for revenge against Pegasus who humiliated him in New York. They decide to target Joey.
 Before the duel Keith brought Bonz, one of his henchmen, to a forbidden underground arena which stacks his Zombie deck to his advantage, and after Keith looks over Bonz deck, he tunes it up so that Joey will never stand a chance.
 Elsewhere, Joey is alone and gets ambushed by  Zygor  and  Sid  and is brought to what is called "The Arena of Lost Souls". After being scared out of his wits, Joey decides to accept the Duel and he and Bonz wager 4 star chips each.

 Trivia 
 The Graveyard field has a similar effect to the " Wasteland " field as it also raises the ATK and DEF of Zombie monsters. 
 Error 
 The anime forgot to include Time Wizard's ATK in the damage equation, so Joey's LP should have 380 instead of 630. 
 Pumpking the King of Ghosts ATK is 1500 when it should be 1800.
