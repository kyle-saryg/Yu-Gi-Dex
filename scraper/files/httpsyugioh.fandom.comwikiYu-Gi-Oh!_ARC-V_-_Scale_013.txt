 Summary 
   This summary is currently incomplete. 
 Yugo 's " Synchro Panic "  Trap Card  and  Ren 's " Synchro Zone " Trap Card have placed their  Turbo Duel  in the latter's favor. But Yugo uses the " Pendulum Transfer " card created by his bond with  Yuya  to  Pendulum Summon  " Clearwing Fast Dragon ", whose status as a  Synchro Monster  allows it to bypass Ren's Field Spell and destroy Ren's " White Aura Whale ". Though Yugo wins the duel, Ren explains that he achieved his goal as he confirms the appearance of light pulses to be the  Adam Factor  while racing away. As  Yuto  and  Yuri  reach Yugo, they find a network of roots emerge with orbs containing memories of Yuya and Yugo when they were younger and not of one body. As Yuto and Yuri assume the Turbo Duel had stirred Yuya's memories up, a shocked and tearful Yugo knows Yuya must never remember the truth about who they all were before residing in his body as he orders his dragon to the destroy the memories.
 Meanwhile,  Reiji  arrives to an excavation site at the outskirts of Maiami City and reaches a messed-up room. After picking up a photo of himself and his  father , Reiji remembers when he was a young prodigy when he met with his father who explains that he is working on a project with a  fellow scientist  to combine  Solid Vision  with  Duel Monsters  as a challenge to the divine. As Reiji remembers his father asking him to continue in his stead should the worst happen, he enters a lab and approaches a glass display case containing a Pendulum card.
