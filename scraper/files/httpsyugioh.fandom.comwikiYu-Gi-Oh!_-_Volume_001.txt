 Story 
 The shy high school student Yugi Mutou is a not so popular kid at school. He spends most of his time thinking about various games and is sometimes subject to bullying. Yugi's life changes after solving the  Millennium Puzzle . Unaware to himself, his body now often becomes host to an ancient Egyptian Pharaoh, who punishes bullies and evil-doers, who cross Yugi and his friends. [4] 
 
 Foreword 
 In the foreword,  Kazuki Takahashi  thanks people for buying the graphic novel and asks people who are borrowing it, if they could buy one too. He says that he finds Yu-Gi-Oh! to be  strange story; at first he had wanted to make a story about "the mysterious" in everyday life, but ended up incorporating that and many different things. He hoped that the reader would become good friends of  Yugi ,  Jonouchi  and  Anzu .
 
 Puzzles 
 The volume contains three puzzles that appear between chapters.
 
 The first is a maze drawn on the  Millennium Puzzle . 
 The second is a spot the difference between two pictures of  Anzu  serving  Yugi  and  Jonouchi  at  Burger World . 
 The last puzzle gives the reader a picture of Yugi and nine other pictures. The reader is to find which of the nine is identical to the first.
