 Description 
 As Yuya's lifelong friend, Zuzu isn't afraid to tell it like it is and put Yuya in check when he goes too far. She's also the daughter of Skip Boyle, the head teacher of You Show Duel School. She wears a bracelet that she's never taken off - some say she was born with it on her wrist! This bracelet emits a strange power when she least expects it - which often gets her in trouble. But since she doesn't always want to count on Yuya to bail her out, she learns how to Fusion Summon to protect herself and You Show Duel School. Her ace monster is "Bloom Diva the Melodious Choir".
