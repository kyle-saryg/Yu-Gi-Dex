 Yuga  and co. decide to take part in the  Rush Duel Tournament , and prepare a training camp for it. As the sun sets,  Romin  and  Sushiko , who also came at the camp, end up Dueling with the right to hog the TV at stake...
 
 Featured Duel: Romin Kirishima vs. Sushiko Maki 
 The Duel is conducted as a Rush Duel.
 Turn 1: Sushiko 
 Sushiko Normal Summons " Sushi Angel Monkey Roll " (1300/1300) and " Sushi Angel Spider Roll " (800/800), then tributes "Spider Roll" to Tribute Summon " Sushi Angel Dragon Roll " (1500/500). She activates the effect of "Dragon Roll" as it was Normal Summoned this turn, letting her place 1  Fairy  monster from her GY on the bottom of her Deck to draw a card, but she cannot declare an attack with Level 6 or lower monsters this turn. Sushiko then sets 3 cards. 
 
 Turn 2: Romin 
 Romin activates " Psycho Burial "; paying 1000 LP (Romin: 4000 → 3000 LP) to send the top 2 cards of her Deck to the GY. Since a card was sent from Romin's Deck to the GY, Sushiko activates her set Trap " Rolling Copper ", letting her place 1 card from Romin's GY to the bottom of her Deck and increase her LP by 1000. She returns " Esperaid of the Smashing Light " (Romin: 3000 → 4000 LP). Romin Normal Summons " Eleckiss " (300/1000), " Elengel " (500/800) and " Romance Pick " (500/0), then Tributes "Eleckiss" and "Elengel" to Tribute Summon " Prima Guitarna of the Colorful Light " (2200/0). Romin activates the effect of "Prima Guitarna", paying 1000 LP (Romin: 4000 → 3000 LP) to increase the ATK of her monsters by 300 for each monster Sushiko controls until the end of the turn ("Prima Guitarna": 2200 → 2800 ATK, "Romance Pick" 500 → 1100 ATK). Since her LP are lower than her opponent's, Romin activates the effect of "Romance Pick", paying 500 LP (Romin: 3000 → 2500 LP) to send the top 3 cards of her Deck to the GY, and if one of those is a  Psychic  monster then she can add a Psychic monster from her GY to her hand. She sends "Romance Pick", " Lullabind " and " Foldablitz of the Dream String " to the GY, then adds "Romance Pick" to her hand. Since Romin added a card from her GY to her hand during her turn, Sushiko activates her set Trap " Rolling Voltecker ", forcing both players to return 1 monster they control to the bottom of their Deck, then one monster Sushiko controls will gain 500 ATK until the end of the turn and Romin will gain 500 LP. Sushiko returns "Monkey Roll", Romin returns "Romance Pick" and Sushiko targets "Dragon Roll" ("Dragon Roll": 1500 → 2000 LP) (Romin: 2500 → 3000 LP). 
 Romin Normal Summons "Romance Pick" (500/0). Romin activates the effect of "Romance Pick" (Romin: 3000 → 2500 LP), sending " Romic'n'Roller ", " Piercing! " and "Romance Pick" to the GY and then adding "Romance Pick" from her GY to her hand. She Normal Summons "Romance Pick" (500/0). She then activates the effect of "Romance Pick" (Romin: 2500 → 2000 LP), sending " Elechic Ampoule ", "Elengel" and " Self Fan Club " to the GY and then adding "Foldablitz of the Dream String" to her hand. She then tributes both copies of "Romance Pick" to Tribute Summon "Foldablitz of the Dream String" (2300/0). Since Sushiko's LP are at least 2000 higher than her own, Romin activates the effect of "Foldablitz", inflicting 1500 damage to Sushiko (Sushiko: 4000 → 2500 LP). "Prima Guitarna" attacks "Dragon Roll", but Sushiko activates her set Trap " Rolling Never Die ", letting her choose 1 Fairy monster she controls and make it unable to be destroyed by battle this turn, but Romin gains LP equal to its ATK. She targets "Dragon Roll" (Romin: 2000 → 4000 LP). The attack continues (Sushiko: 2500 → 1700 LP). "Foldablitz" attacks "Dragon Roll" (Sushiko: 1700 → 1400 LP). 
 Turn 3: Sushiko 
 Since Sushiko has no cards in her hand, she draws five cards. Sushiko Normal Summons "Sushi Angel Spider Roll" (800/800), then tributes "Spider Roll" and "Dragon Roll" to Tribute Summon " Garibel the Extra Premium Sushi Angel " (2400/1800). Since Romin's LP are at least 2000 higher than her own and Romin controls 2 or more Level 6 or higher monsters, Sushiko activates " Inside Out Roll ", letting her decrease the ATK of a monster Romin controls by 2000 until the end of the turn. She targets "Prima Guitarna" ("Prima Guitarna": 2200 → 200 ATK). Since Romin's LP are 4000 or higher, Sushiko activates the effect of "Garibel", sending 2 cards from her hand to the GY to target 1 Level 8 or lower monster Romin controls and inflict damage to her equal to its ATK. She targets "Foldablitz" (Romin: 4000 → 1700 LP). "Garibel" attacks and destroys "Prima Guitarna" (Romin: 1700 → 0 LP).
