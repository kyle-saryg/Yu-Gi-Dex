Unconfirmed Effects  are an unnamed type of  effect , one of the variety of  Unclassified Effects , that resemble both  Continuous Effects  and  Lingering Effects .
 In a text sense, they resemble Continuous Effects, but are not considered to be so as their effect can be negated only in specific cases. All of these effects place a condition on the field (either a restriction or an additional advantage) that applies during the entire turn in which they are Summoned or flipped face-up (the specific cause varies between cards). The condition is placed as soon as they are Summoned or flipped face-up, and it remains in play even if something happens to the monster later on. Therefore, the only way to prevent this kind of effect is to negate the  Summon  altogether, or for there to be a Continuous effect-negating effect already on the field when the monster is Summoned (" Skill Drain ", " Destiny HERO - Plasma ", etc.). Their effects won't be negated if, for example, a Skill Drain is activated in response to their Summon; it has to have already been face-up on the field when they were Normal Summoned. [1]
