 In New Domino City, the hottest game in town is the Turbo Duel, fought from blazingly fast motorcycles called Duel Runners. On the outskirts of New Domino City, in a district known as Satellite, a new Turbo Duel hero emerges—Yusei Fudo! On his custom-built Duel Runner, Yusei takes on all challengers, fighting for his friends and the future of Satellite! [1] 
 Light Sense!! 
 Yusei and Sect continue their epic duel in Aerial Fortress Seibal. As Sect unleashes a powerful attack, he tells Yusei the Ultimate God is about to return to life. If their friendship is strong enough, they may be able to withstand the Ultimate God's resurrection—but are their struggles all just part of Goodwin’s plan? [2] 
 
 Story 
 New Domino City, in the year 20XX, Turbo Duels, fought from the seats of motorcycled-shaped duel disks called "Duel Runners," are the hottest game in town. 
 Yusei Fudo, the toughest Duelist in Satellite, suffered a painful loss to Jack Atlas. In order to duel Jack again, Yusei entered the D1 Grand Prix, the battle to determine the strongest duelist in the world!! As the strongmen of the dueling world slugged it out, Yusei fought his way into the second round, where he beat, Crow, Leo and Luna, and won his own Duel Dragon, Stardust Spark Dragon! In the Corridor of the Northern Sky, Yusei connected to the Skeleton Knights feelings and became the King of the Sky's Lock, but Sect has fallen into the darkness and become the King of the Earth's Lock. In an attempt to take back Sect's soul, Yusei challenges him to a Turbo Duel…! [2] 
 
 In the Next Volume… 
 Yusei and Goodwin are locked in their final Duel. Having now harnessed the power of the Ultimate Dragon, Goodwin can turn Yusei's Duel Dragons against him. The assault may be more than Yusei can bear, and he will need his friends' help to have an chance of winning, but will it be enough?
