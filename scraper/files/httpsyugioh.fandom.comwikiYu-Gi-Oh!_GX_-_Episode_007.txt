 Summary 
 At the  Slifer Red  dorm, a group of black clad-troopers arrives, and  Professor Banner  identifies them as the school's "Disciplinary Action Squad". They only appear when a student has committed a serious crime. Led by their  Chairman , they lead  Syrus Truesdale  and  Jaden Yuki  to  Chancellor Sheppard , who suspends them. They are being punished for visiting the  Abandoned Dorm  (it was Crowler who told Sheppard about the dorm visit). At  Dr. Crowler 's suggestion, Sheppard authorizes a Tag Team Duel: Jaden and Syrus will duel two opponents that Crowler himself will choose. If they win, they get off scot-free. If they lose, they are expelled. Upon hearing this,  Chumley Huffington  and  Alexis Rhodes  both attempt to convince Sheppard to let them duel instead of Syrus, as they were also at the Dorm, and both believe Syrus to be too weak. But Sheppard's hands are tied; he can't change the Duel's makeup at this point.
 Jaden and Syrus agree to have a Duel against one another as practice. When Syrus draws " Power Bond ", he freezes up and is unable to play it. A flashback is shown. Syrus is dueling a bully,  Gorisuke  (unnamed in the dub), in grade school. He has " Steamroid " and " Gyroid " on the Field and has just drawn "Power Bond". The bully has " Gearfried the Iron Knight " and a  Set  card. Syrus begins to play "Power Bond", believing he can use it to win and finally pay the bully back for all the suffering he's caused. However,  Syrus' older brother Zane  stops the Duel and gives the bully a rare card to convince the bully to pretend the Duel never happened and walk away. Zane scolds Syrus, telling him he can't use "Power Bond" until he's truly a Duelist. His opponent's Set card was " Spellbinding Circle ", which would have incapacitated the monster Syrus had summoned, and caused him to lose due to the final effect of "Power Bond". 
 In the present, Syrus still believes he doesn't have the skill to play "Power Bond", and summons " Steam Gyroid " using " Polymerization " instead. He loses on his next turn, and Jaden is surprised to see that he didn't play "Power Bond", as that would have won Syrus the Duel. Syrus runs away, believing he couldn't ever be Jaden's tag team partner, as he'd only drag him down. Alexis explains to Jaden that Syrus' brother is Zane, the best Duelist in the school, and a third-year  Obelisk Blue  student. Jaden resolves to duel Zane in an attempt to help Syrus.

 Featured Duels 
 Jaden Yuki vs. Syrus Truesdale 
 
 This Duel uses  Yu-Gi-Oh! GX  anime gameplay . Rules and  card effects  may differ from that of the  TCG / OCG . See the individual card articles for more information.     
 Turn 1: Jaden 
 Jaden   draws  " Elemental HERO Avian ". Jaden's  hand  contains " A Hero Emerges ", " The Warrior Returning Alive ", " Elemental HERO Burstinatrix ", " Elemental HERO Sparkman ", and " Negate Attack ". He  Normal Summons  "Avian" (1000/1000) in  Attack Position  and  Sets  a card.
 Turn 2: Syrus 
 Syrus  draws " Patroid ". Syrus' hand contains " Shield Crush ", " Weapon Change ", " Limiter Removal ", " Steamroid ", and " Gyroid ". He Normal Summons "Patroid" (1200/1200) in Attack Position. "Patroid"  attacks  "Avian", but Jaden  activates  his  face-down  " Negate Attack " to  negate  the attack and end the  Battle Phase .
 Turn 3: Jaden 
Jaden draws " Elemental HERO Clayman ". He then Normal Summons "Sparkman" (1600/1400) in Attack Position. "Sparkman" attacks and  destroys  "Patroid" (Syrus: 4000 → 3600 LP). "Avian" then attacks  directly  (Syrus: 3600 → 2600 LP). Jaden Sets a card [Notes 1] .
 Turn 4: Syrus 
Syrus draws " Pot of Greed " and subsequently activates it to draw two cards (" Polymerization " and " Power Bond "). He then activates "Polymerization" to  fuse  "Gyroid" and "Steamroid" to  Fusion Summon  " Steam Gyroid " (2200/1600) in Attack Position. "Steam Gyroid" attacks and destroys "Avian" (Jaden: 4000 → 2800 LP).
 Turn 5: Jaden 
Jaden draws "Polymerization" and subsequently activates it to fuse "Sparkman" and "Clayman" to Fusion Summon " Elemental HERO Thunder Giant " (2400/1500) in Attack Position. The  effect  of "Thunder Giant" then activates, allowing Jaden to destroy "Steam Gyroid". Jaden then Normal Summons "Burstinatrix" (1200/800) in Attack Position. "Thunder Giant" and "Burstinatrix" attack directly (Syrus: 2600 → 200 → 0 LP).
 
 Gorisuke vs. Syrus Truesdale 
 Duel already in progress. Syrus has 1600  LP  and  controls  "Steamroid" and "Gyroid", while Gorisuke has 1900 LP and controls " Gearfried the Iron Knight " and a  Set  card (" Spellbinding Circle ").
 Syrus' turn 
Syrus  draws  " Power Bond " and subsequently tries to  activate  it, intending to use it to  fuse  "Gyroid" and "Steamroid" to  Fusion Summon  " Steam Gyroid ". When "Steam Gyroid" is Fusion Summoned, its original  ATK  will be doubled, but Syrus will take  damage  equal to the original ATK of "Steam Gyroid" during his  End Phase .
 Before Syrus can activate "Power Bond", Zane stops the Duel and gives the bully a rare card to insure he will not tell anybody about this Duel. He then revealed to Syrus he had stopped the Duel because he knew Syrus was going to lose the Duel due to him trying to use "Power Bond" without knowing what his opponent's Set card was.
 
 Trivia 
 When Jaden looks at Syrus' hand at the end of their duel, Jaden points out that Syrus would have beat him had he used "Power Bond" in combination with "Limiter Removal" which was in his hand, making the attack points of "Steam Gyroid" 8800 (meaning that if Avian was attacked once those cards were played, Jaden would've been dealt a total of 7800 points of damage). 
 Mistakes 
 In the dub, " Elemental HERO Clayman " is shown as an  Effect Monster  instead of a  Normal Monster . 
 Before Syrus summons " Steam Gyroid " the second card is " Patroid " instead of " Steamroid "
