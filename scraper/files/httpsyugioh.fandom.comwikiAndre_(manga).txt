 Biography 
 Andre was present at the D1 Grand Prix opening ceremonies where he watched  Rex Goodwin 's introduction to the tournament. He later showed disgust at Jack when he mocked the contestants for being weak. Andre then observed  Yusei 's  Duel  with  Greiger [2]  and later,  Akiza 's Duel against  Sherry . [3] 
 Although Andre's  Duels  weren't shown, he made it to the tournament finals. On the cruise to  Saiko Island , he and Jean commented on Crow's argument with Leo, suggesting Crow isn't very mature. They do however note that he is a powerful contender as he easily defeated  Bolt Tanner  with a  One Turn Kill . An omake revealed that Andre watched a food eating contest between  Leo  and Crow as they didn't have their  Duel Runners . Before the finalists set off, Andre wishes Jean farewell, stating the he'll meet him in the finals. [1] 
 Andre defeated  Ramon Kagura , obtaining the Level 11 Star Ticket. Next, the two Duel again for the Level 10 Star Ticket. Jean and Andre's plan was to Jean obtain the Level 1 and 2 tickets while Andre obtained the Level 10 and 11 ones, so that both could advance to the finals. [4] 
 Andre later lost to  Lazar  who revealed to him that he was collecting the finalist's souls with  Soul Prison  cards, shortly before doing the same to Andre. [5]
