Mind Shuffle  is the strategy that  Yugi Muto  and  Yami Yugi  came up with to defeat  Maximillion Pegasus  at Duelist Kingdom, during the final Duel in the  Yu-Gi-Oh! manga  and  second anime series . 
 
 Events 
 They had no choice but to use it since Pegasus could see all of Yugi's cards with the  Millennium Eye . When they were using this tactic, one of them drew a card, then immediately switched to the other person so Pegasus could not see what card it was. But Pegasus turned the game into a  Shadow Game , so little Yugi would not be able to take much of the strain. Yami tried to persuade Yugi to stop, since Yami was used to the Shadow Games already and could tell Yugi wasn't doing so well, but Yugi insisted that he would keep going. He then found the card to beat Pegasus, and passed out.
