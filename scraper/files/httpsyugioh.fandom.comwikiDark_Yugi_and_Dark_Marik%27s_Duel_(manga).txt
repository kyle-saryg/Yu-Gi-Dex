 Prior 
 Having translated the effects of  Dark Marik 's  God  card, " The Sun Dragon Ra ", Kaiba calculated a 13% probability of his Deck defeating it. [1]  To improve his chances, he developed a strategy involving " Devil's Sanctuary " [2] [3]  and attempted to win " Slifer the Sky Dragon " from Dark Yugi in the semifinals. [4]  His failure to defeat Dark Yugi led to Dark Yugi facing Dark Marik in the finals, with a success probability Kaiba calculated as being 3%. [5]  Despite disapproving of Dark Yugi losing after defeating him, Kaiba later expressed no interest in who won or lost the final. [6] 
 As Kaiba prepared to activate explosives for the sinking of  Alcatraz  for the last act of Battle City, he was interrupted by  Ishizu Ishtar , who pleaded with him to help Dark Yugi. He was unmoved by her claims of destiny and likening of his and Dark Yugi's relationship to that of  Priest Seto  and the pharaoh. When he saw how she was willing to give her life in failing to save her brother,  Marik , he was reminded of himself in  a previous Duel  with Dark Yugi and decided to help. He gave the "Devil's Sanctuary" card to Dark Yugi, but told himself [6]  and Ishizu [7]  it was out of motivation to disprove the notion of miracles and Dark Yugi's ideology that friendship can bring victory. With "Devil's Sanctuary", he calculated Dark Yugi's odds of winning to be 20%. [6]
