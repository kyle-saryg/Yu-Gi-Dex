 A  Normal Summon  ( 通 常 召 喚   Tsūjō Shōkan  "Normal Summon", or simply  召 喚   Shōkan  "Summon") is the simplest way to  Summon  a  monster . The  turn player  can perform a Normal Summon during their  Main Phase  when the  game state  is open.
 In OCG text, "Normal Summon/ Set " would be referred to as  通 常 召 喚 , while "Normal Summon (but not set)" would be referred to as only  召 喚 .

 Mechanics 
 To perform a Normal Summon, the player simply plays a monster directly from their  hand  into an available  Main Monster Zone  in  face-up   Attack Position , declaring that the monster is being Normal Summoned.
 After each Normal Summon, a  Summon negation window  opens, and either player may negate the summon. If not, the summon is considered successful, and the  Summon Response Window  opens, and each player, starting from the turn player, may respond to the summon. If no action is taken, the game state becomes open again.
 Special Summon Monsters , including  Ritual Monsters , cannot be Normal Summoned.
 In addition to the "Normal" Normal Summons, are three sub-categories.
 
 Normal Set 
 Main article:  Normal Set Instead of Normal Summoning a monster in face-up Attack Position, a player may instead play that monster defensively by "Set", placing the monster in face-down  Defense Position .
 The turn player can only Normal Summon or  Set  once per  turn , and only once that turn. Monsters cannot be Normal Summoned in face-up  Defense Position , unless stated otherwise.
 
 Tribute Summon 
 Main article:  Tribute Summon For monsters that are Level 5 or higher, you must Tribute at least 1 monster you control before the Normal Summon/Set. This is called a Tribute Summon. Monsters that are Level 5 or 6 require 1 Tribute and Monsters that are Level 7 or higher require 2 Tributes.
 Tribute Set 
 Main article:  Tribute Set If you Tribute Summon in face-down Defense Position, it is called a Tribute Set. A monster Tribute Set on the field is NOT considered Summoned.
 Gemini monsters 
 Main article:  Gemini monster 
 Gemini monsters  are a type of monster that are treated as  Normal Monsters  on the field, but they can be Normal Summoned again while already face-up on the field to make them Effect Monster and "unlock" their effect(s). (This Normal Summon counts as the player's one Normal Summon/Set per turn). If the monster in question is Level 5 or higher, no tribute is required for the second Normal Summon.
 
 Multiple Normal Summon 
 While a player may only perform 1 Normal Summon/Set per turn, there are three types of "Additional Normal Summon" effects which can increase this limit. [1] 
 
 Set new Normal Summon/Set Limit 
 These effects simply set the Normal Summon/Set limit to a fixed number. They do not stack, and the one that grant the highest number will apply (e.g. If a player applied both the Effect of " Double Summon " and " Chain Summoning ", the limit number would be 3).
 
 Allows multiple Normal Summon 
 Main article:  Allows multiple Normal Summons These effect gives the player additional Normal Summon/Set limit, but the player can only gain these effects once per turn. So, even the player applies multiple of these effects, they will get a total of 1 additional Normal Summon, the change is that the player has wider set of eligible monsters to be summoned this way.
 However, these effects will stack with the first group. (e.g. They player may apply the effect of " Double Summon " and " Swap Frog ", and they can Normal Summon/Set twice this turn due to the former. They can also Normal Summon 1 "Frog" monster in addition to the limit due to the latter, making the summon limit 2+1, or simply put, 3.)
 
 Performs a Normal Summon 
 Main article:  Performs a Normal Summon These effects outright perform a Normal Summon, and the action does not count toward the turn's Normal Summon/Set limit. Player must outright perform the Normal Summon (or Set, if applicable) immediately after that effect resolves.
