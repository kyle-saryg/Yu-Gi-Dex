 The might of the " Ancient Dragon ". 
 Apdnarg Otum  soon reveals the target he was chasing with his combo of Cards: the powerful and mighty " Ancient Dragon ", which proves to be a tough opponent, given the  Effect  of the  Field Spell Card  " Ancient City ". 
 Professor Hawkins explains that several Spell Cards and Monster Cards are needed to fulfill the  Summoning Conditions  of " Ancient Dragon ": both he and Solomon searched for them and got stuck: they were missing the " Ancient Key "  Spell Card . However, Solomon went and finally managed to acquire it, to the Professor's delight: he's finally able to see the combo finished. 
 Eventually, Joey manages a combo to get rid of " Ancient City " and wins the Duel. Apdnarg Otum "unveils" himself, taking Joey aback while the others sigh: it was obvious from the very beginning! 
 Meanwhile... 
 It also shown how  Leon Wilson  has won over  Richard Goat . The medic collapses and both nurses have to evacuate him in a stretcher, to Leon's surprise. 
 Besides, everyone's comic relief duo,  Weevil Underwood  and  Rex Raptor  make it to Kaiba Land USA, having heard of the KC Grand Prix. They're ready to have their rematches on both Yugi & Joey. 
 Featured Duel: Joey Wheeler vs. Apdnarg Otum 
 Duel continues from previous episode. 
 Joey has 2200 Life Points remaining and controls no cards.
 Apdnarg has 5000 Life Points remaining and controls " Ancient Giant " (2200/1100) and two " Stone Giants " (400/2000) in Attack Position
and " Ancient City ", " Ancient Key ", " The Legendary Gambler ", and one set card.
 Turn 7: Joey  
Joey draws " Goblin Attack Force " and subsequently Normal Summons it (2300/0) in Attack Position. "Goblin Attack Force" attacks Apdnarg Otum's " Ancient Giant ", but Apdnarg Otum activates his face-down " Ordeal of a Traveler ". Now when Joey attacks, Apdnarg can select a random Card from his hand and make Joey guess whether the random card is a  Magic ,  Trap , or  Monster Card . If Joey guesses wrong, his attacking monster is returned to his hand. Apdnarg selects the only card in his hand for the effect of "Ordeal of a Traveler" and Joey guesses  Magic Card  (Trap Card in the dub), but the chosen card is revealed to be a monster (" Sinister Serpent "), so "Goblin Attack Force" is returned to Joey hand. Joey  Sets  a Card.
 Turn 8: Apdnarg  
Apdnarg draws "Ancient Tome". "Ancient Giant" attacks directly, but Joey activates his face-down " Scapegoat " to  Special Summon  four " Sheep Tokens " (0/0 for all) in  Defense Position . A replay occurs and Apdnarg uses "Ancient Giant" to attack & destroy one "Sheep Token". Apdnarg Otum then activates " Ancient Tome ". Now once during Apdnarg's Main Phase, he can swap a Card in his  Hand  with the top Card of his  Deck . He must also send one card from his hand to the Graveyard during his Standby Phase, or "Ancient Tome" will be destroyed. 
 Apdnarg then activates the effect of "Ancient Tome" to swap the "Sinister Serpent" in his hand with the top card of his Deck. He then switches his two " Stone Giants " (400/2000) to  Defense Position . On Apdanarg's End Phase, the effects of both "Stone Giants" activate ( Apdanrg Otum  5000 → 4500 → 4000).
 Turn 9: Joey  
Joey draws " Roll of Fate ". He then Normal Summons "Goblin Attack Force" (2300/0) in  Attack Position .
 Turn 10: Apdnarg  
Apdnarg draws "Sinister Serpent". On Apdanrg's Standby Phase, he sends "Sinister Serpent" from his hand to the Graveyard to keep "Ancient Tome" in play. The effect of "Sinister Serpent" then activates, returning it from Apdnarg's  Graveyard  to his hand. Apdnarg then switches his two "Stone Giants" to  Attack Position . He then activates the second effect of "Ancient Key" to send it and his two "Stone Giants" to the Graveyard in order to add "Ancient Gate" from his Deck to his hand. Apdnarg then activates " Ancient Gate ". 
 Apdnarg then activates the first effect of "Ancient City" to send "Ancient Gate", "Ancient Giant" and "Ancient Tome" to the Graveyard and  Special Summon  " Ancient Dragon " (2800/2100) in  Attack Position . "Ancient Dragon" attacks & destroys Joey's "Goblin Attack Force" ( Joey  2200 → 1700). Since "Ancient Dragon" destroyed a monster in battle, its effect activates, destroying all of Joey's  Defense Position  Monsters.
 Turn 11: Joey  
Joey draws "Gilford the Lightning". He then activates "Roll of Fate" to roll a die. Depending on the result, Joey must draw the same number of Cards as the result of the roll from his Deck, then he must send that same number of Cards from the top of his  Deck  to his  Graveyard . Apdnarg then activates the effect of " The Legendary Gambler " to roll a die of his own. Joey's "Roll of Fate" roll is a 4 while Apdnarg Otum's "The Legendary Gambler" roll is a 3, so the effect of "Roll of Fate" continues. Joey draws four cards and sends the top four cards of his  Deck  to the  Graveyard . 
 Joey then activates " Landstar Forces " to Special Summon " Brigadier of Landstar " (900/1200), " Knight of Landstar " (1000/900) and " Grappler of Landstar " (1000/500) from his hand in Attack Position. Joey then Tributes "Brigadier of Landstar", "Knight of Landstar" and "Grappler of Landstar" in order to Tribute Summon " Gilford the Lightning " (2800/1400) in Attack Position. Since "Gilford the Lightning" was Tribute Summoned by Tributing three monsters, its effect activates, destroying all of Apdanarg's monsters. 
 "Gilford the Lightning" attacks directly. The effect of Apdanarg's "Ordeal of a Traveler" activates, forcing Joey to guess the type of one card in Apdnarg's hand. Joey guesses Monster (it was the "Sinister Serpent" which returned to Solomon's hand previously). He is correct, so the direct attack continues ( Apdanarg Otum  4000 → 1200). On Joey's End Phase, Apdanarg Otum activates the second effect of "Ancient City" to revive "Ancient Dragon" (2800/2100) from in Attack Position.
 Turn 12: Apdnarg 
Apdnarg draws. "Ancient Dragon" attacks Joey's "Gilford the Lightning". Both monsters are destroyed in a  Double KO . On Apdnarg's End Phase, he activates the second effect of "Ancient City" to revive "Ancient Dragon" (2800/2100) in Attack Position.
 Turn 13: Joey  
Joey draws " Pot of Greed " and subsequently activates it to draw two cards (" Giant Trunade " and " Premature Burial "). Joey's hand is shown to contain " Jinzo ", " Polymerization ", and " Alligator's Sword ". Joey then activates "Premature Burial" to pay 800 Life Points ( Joey  1700 → 900) and revive "Goblin Attack Force" (2300/0) in  Attack Position . Joey then activates "Giant Trunade" to return all  Magic  and  Trap Cards  to their owner's  Hands ; "The Legendary Gambler", "Ordeal of a Traveler", and "Ancient City" are returned to Apdanarg Otum's hand while "Premature Burial" is returned to Joey's  Hand . 
 Joey then activates "Premature Burial" again ( Joey  900 → 100) to revive "Gilford the Lightning" (2800/1400) in  Attack Position . "Gilford the Lightning" attacks Apdnarg Otum's "Ancient Dragon". Both monsters are destroyed in a Double KO. "Goblin Attack Force" attacks directly ( Apdnarg Otum  1200 → 0).
 
 Differences in adaptations 
       " Brigadier of Landstar " in  episode 187 .     
 In the previous episode, "Brigadier of Landstar" was seen in Joey's  hand . However, this card was not seen nor does it appear in his hand instead " Alligator's Sword " a card that he didn't used was seen. This meant "Swordsman of Landstar" was suppose to be "Alligator's Sword". 
 The gun of " Brigadier of Landstar " is edited to look less realistic. " Landstar Forces " has Brigadier's gun edited as well. 
 In " Premature Burial ", the cross is blurred and made less visible, to avoid any religious connotation. 
 " Ancient Tome " was given a different artwork. 
 Mistakes 
 When Apnarg redraws " Sinister Serpent ", after having switched it with the top card of his deck with " Ancient Tome " the previous turn, he is shown putting the drawn card into his hand and discarding the Sinister Serpent already in his hand for Ancient Tome's cost.
