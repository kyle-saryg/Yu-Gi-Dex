 Description 
 As a big fan of Zane Truesdale Blair wanted to go to the same school as him. But there's one problem:She's too young to enroll. Therefore, she wore a disguise to enter Duel Academy before she was old enough to attend. Though she was caught and forced to leave. Blair was able to re-enroll after finishing 2nd in the GX Tournament. And along the way, her eyes switched from Zane to a different target. With her "Maiden of Love" card, she hopes her crush on Jaden comes to fruition.

 Trivia 
 Some of the cards for which Blair has card-specific dialogue, such as the  Lightsworn  archetype, were not used in the anime or manga, and are references to her video game counterpart ( Tag Force ) using those said cards. 
 Tyranno Hassleberry  andÂ Blair FlanniganÂ are the Legendary Duelists who have a Deck of cards that exceed the average number of cards in a Deck: 20. This is due to their respective Roaming Duelist Decks, "Ultimate Tyranno Deck!" and "A Maiden's Promise", being comprised of 30 cards. 
 Ishizu Ishtar ,Â  Tristan Taylor (DM) ,Â  Sera ,Â  Scud ,Â  Prana ,Â Blair Flannigan, andÂ  Carly Carmine Â are the only Legendary Duelists who do not have a cutscene for when they Summon their ace monster(s). Although it should be noted that none of them possessed an ace monster with which to begin. 
 Yuma and Astral ,  Yusei Fudo ,Â  Jaden/Yubel ,Â  Jaden Yuki ,Â  Kite Tenjo ,  Crow Hogan ,Â  Jack Atlas ,Â  Reginald Kastle ,  Chazz Princeton ,  Joey Wheeler (DSOD) ,Â  Zane Truesdale ,Â  Syrus Truesdale ,Â  Seto Kaiba (DM) ,  Yugi Muto (DSOD) ,  Seto Kaiba (DSOD) ,Â Blair Flannigan,  Leo ,Â  Bronk Stone ,  Aster Phoenix ,  Joey Wheeler (DM) ,Â  Akiza Izinski ,Â  Rex Goodwin , andÂ  Dark Signer Kalin Kessler , in descending order, are the characters with the most card-specific dialogue in-game. 
 The Paradox Brothers ,  Arkana ,  Lumis and Umbra ,  Aigami , Sera, Prana,  Jesse Anderson ,  Alexis Rhodes ,  Dr. Vellian Crowler ,  Bastion Misawa , Tyranno Hassleberry,  Sartorius Kumar , Blair Flannigan, Yusei Fudo, Dark Signer Kalin Kessler,  Kalin Kessler , and Reginald Kastle are the Legendary Duelists who have dialogue for cards that are non-existent, unreleased, anime-exclusive, or video game exclusive. It is uncertain as to why these cards were found in the voice files, or if these said cards will be released in the future.
 Blair's dialogue for such cards include: " Mystic Baby Dragon ", "Mystic Baby Knight", "Mystic Knight", "Mystic Baby Magician", " Mystic Dragon ", "Mystic Egg", "Mystic Knight", "Mystic Magician", " Mystic Revolution ", and " Spike Egg ".
