 Before taking part in  Death-T ,  Grandpa  gave  Yugi  his Deck to use defeat  Kaiba  with. [1]  After he and his friends passed the earlier stages of Death-T, Dark Yugi used the Deck for this Duel. [2] 
 Spectators from  Death T-4  rushed to the Dome Duel Arena to watch this Duel, unaware it was intended as a means of killing the Yugis.  Jonouchi  and  Anzu , who were held at gunpoint were also brought here to see this. [2] 
 
 The Duel 
 
 Dark Yugi's turn 
 Dark Yugi Summoned " Winged Dragon, Guardian of the Fortress " ( ATK : 1400). Kaiba countered with " Hitotsu-Me Giant " (ATK: 1200). "Winged Dragon, Guardian of the Fortress"  attacked  and  destroyed  "Hitotsu-Me Giant" (Kaiba: 2000 → 1800  Life Points ). [2] 
 
 
 Kaiba's turn 
 Kaiba Summoned " The Wicked Worm Beast " and attacked "Winged Dragon, Guardian of the Fortress". Since it had the power of Flight, the "Winged Dragon" had a 35% chance of evading the attack. It managed to dodge the attack and destroy "The Wicked Worm Beast". [3] 
 Since he ended his turn without any monsters on his side of the field, Kaiba got to Summon a monster in  Defense Mode  and choose " Saggi the Dark Clown " (DEF: 1500). [3] 
 
 
 Dark Yugi's turn 
 Dark Yugi Summoned an unnamed lion-like monster in Defense Mode. [3] 
 
 
 Kaiba's turn 
 Kaiba equipped "Saggi the Dark Clown" with " Dark Energy " (ATK: 600 → 1800) and switched it to  Attack Mode . [3] 
 "Saggi" attacked and destroyed "Winged Dragon, Guardian of the Fortress" (Dark Yugi: 2000 → 1600 Life Points). [3] 
 
 
 Dark Yugi's turn 
 Dark Yugi  drew  " Right Leg of the Forbidden One ". [3] 
 Dark Yugi Summoned " Sangan " in Defense Mode (DEF: 600). [3] 
 
 
 Kaiba's turn 
 "Saggi" attacked and destroyed "Sangan". [3] 
 
 
 Turns not shown 
 Dark Yugi Summons more monsters, which get destroyed by "Saggi" and his Life Points are further lowered to 1400. [3] 
 
 
 
 Dark Yugi's turn 
 Dark Yugi draws " Gaia the Fierce Knight " and Summons it (ATK: 2300). [3] 
 "Gaia" attacks and destroys "Saggi" (Kaiba: 1800 → 1300 Life Points). [3] 
 
 
 Kaiba's turn 
 Kaiba draws and Summons " Blue-Eyes White Dragon " (ATK: 3000), which attacks and destroys "Gaia" (Dark Yugi: 700 Life Points). [3] 
 
 
 Dark Yugi's turn 
 Dark Yugi draws " Imp " and plays in in Defense Mode (DEF: 1000). [4] 
 
 
 Kaiba's turn 
 "Blue-Eyes White Dragon" attacks and destroys "Imp". [4] 
 
 
 Dark Yugi's turn 
 Dark Yugi Summons " Beaver Warrior " in Defense Mode. [4] 
 
 
 Kaiba's turn 
 Instead of attacking, Kaiba draws a card, which turns out to be another "Blue-Eyes White Dragon". [4] 
 Kaiba Summons the second "Blue-Eyes White Dragon". [4] 
 
 
 Dark Yugi's turn 
 Dark Yugi draws " Swords of Revealing Light " and activates it, preventing Kaiba's monsters from attacking for three turns. [4] 
 
 
 Kaiba's turn 
 Kaiba Summons an unnamed kappa-like monster in Defense Mode. [4] 
 
 
 Dark Yugi's turn 
 Dark Yugi's hand contained "Right Leg of the Forbidden One", " Left Arm of the Forbidden One ", " Left Leg of the Forbidden One " and an unnamed wolf monster. [4] 
 The two Yugis began to doubt that they could win. Yugi imagined he saw Grandpa talking to him. Grandpa reminded Yugi that not too long ago he was suffering and asked him how he got over that. Yugi replied that he solved the  Millennium Puzzle . Grandpa nodded and said that was right; he put the pieces of the puzzle together and reminded him that nothing is meaningless in the world, and cards are like pieces of a puzzle. This reminded Dark Yugi of " Exodia ", a monster that required five cards to Summon. He realized that the three "the Forbidden One" cards in his hand were the sealed limbs and he needed to collect the rest to Summon "Exodia". [4] 
 Dark Yugi drew " Right Arm of the Forbidden One ". Kaiba noticed his expression changed when he drew the card, but was convinced that there was nothing Dark Yugi could do to win at this point. [4] 
 
 
 Kaiba's turn 
 Kaiba Summoned " Judgeman " (ATK: 2200).
 Since "Judgeman" was Summoned after "Swords of Revealing Light" was played, it was able to attack and destroyed "Beaver Warrior". [4] 
 
 
 Dark Yugi's turn 
 Dark Yugi drew " Dark Magician ", Summoned it (ATK: 2500) and used it to attack and destroy "Judgeman" (Kaiba: 1300 → 1000 Life Points). [4] 
 
 
 Kaiba's turn 
 Kaiba drew his third "Blue-Eyes White Dragon", Summoned it and used it to attack and destroy "Dark Magician" (Dark Yugi: 700 → 200 Life Points). [4] 
 
       Dark Yugi, imagining his friends are with him.     
 
 Dark Yugi's turn 
 Dark Yugi had four pieces of "Exodia" in his hand. He worried about the odds of drawing the last card and began to fear he couldn't do it. He then imagined that  Jonouchi ,  Anzu  and  Honda  were with him and together they held out their hands forming the  symbol of friendship  Anzu drew in  Death T-3 . [5] 
 No longer afraid, Dark Yugi drew his next card " Exodia the Forbidden One ". With all five pieces, Dark Yugi Summoned " Exodia " (ATK:  ∞ ). [5] 
 "Exodia" attacked Kaiba and his monsters (Kaiba: 1000 → 0 Life Points), winning the Duel for Dark Yugi. [5] 
 
 
 
 Aftermath 
       Kaiba, reconstructing the puzzle of his heart.     
 To punish Seto Kaiba for his crimes Dark Yugi inflicted the Mind Crush  Penalty Game  on him, destroying the corrupted part of his heart. His body was left motionless, while inside he began reconstructing his heart properly. [6] 
 Jonouchi, Anzu and  Johji  were still at gunpoint, by Kaiba's guards, but Honda appeared and helped fight them off. One of the guards managed to get back his gun and threatened to kill Jonouchi. However  Mokuba , who had rescued Honda previously arrived and told the guards to let them go. [6] 
 Anzu asked Mokuba why Seto went through all the trouble of creating  Death-T  just to get revenge. So Mokuba told Yugi and his friends how he and Seto had been adopted after Seto defeated  Gozaburo Kaiba  in  chess  by cheating and how Gozaburo vigorously pushed Seto to become his heir, unknowingly making Seto his enemy, who drove him to his suicide by taking control of  KaibaCorp . [6] 
 Dark Yugi explained to Mokuba that Kaiba was rebuilding his heart and would return when he completes it. [6]
