 B.A.D. , standing for  Barbaric Area after Damage , was the most dangerous zone within the  Satellite . 
 
 History 
 The first  Ener-D  reactor, which was then the  Dark Signers ' base and the gateway to the Underworld currently resided within the deepest part of the B.A.D. In the past, this area was very wealthy and productive. After the  Zero Reverse  incident occurred, a large crater was left in the middle where the ruins of the old Ener-D remained. The entire sector was leveled and eventually was separated by  Sector Security  in accordance with  Rex Goodwin 's orders. The security forces could not enter the area due to direct orders given from Goodwin so they abandoned the area, which in turn made it a popular place for people with  Criminal Marks  wanting to avoid Security.
 Sometime later, the Dark Signers not only made it their home, but also unleashed a fog out of the area which absorbed most people in the Satellite ( Martha  and a few others were safe, as the fog didn't reach their place). Thus, they were able to establish themselves as the main power in B.A.D. in addition to serving as the guardians of the Ener-D reactor, which then served as the doorway to the Underworld.        
 In the  World Racing Grand Prix  Final,  Aporia  damaged the circuit during the final round, which caused him and  Yusei Fudo  to continue their  Turbo Duel  on the streets. Fearing for the safety of the civilians, Yusei drove to the old B.A.D. area, which was devoid of people, to continue the Duel. [1]
