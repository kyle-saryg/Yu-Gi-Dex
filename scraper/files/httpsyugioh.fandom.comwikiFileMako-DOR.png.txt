 Biography 
 Duelist Kingdom 
         Mako linework in the  Duelist Kingdom  arc.     
 Mako's first appearance is in the  Duelist Kingdom  arc, where he Duels  Yugi Muto  in a battleground near the sea. Due to the fact that his side of the field was water, all of his monsters gained power bonuses and they were able to hide themselves from attack. Therefore, Mako's monsters were able to devastate Yugi's monsters until Yugi played " Full Moon " to increase the  ATK  of his " Silver Fang ". From here, he shattered the moon with " Giant Soldier of Stone ", draining the sea and exposing Mako's monsters. Then he played " Curse of Dragon " which in combination with the " Burning Land " card, incinerated Mako's monsters and won Yugi the Duel.
 
 Battle City 
         Mako linework in the  Battle City  arc     
         Mako congratulating Joey on his victory     
 His next appearance in the series is during the  Battle City  arc. It showed him trying to catch fish in the killer whale tank at Domino City Aquarium, where he was chewed out by the  Domino City Aquarium worker , the killer whale's trainer. When the worker was too ill to perform the scheduled show, Mako volunteered to take her place, due to his bond with all sea creatures. 
 He was found at the show by  Joey Wheeler  who he Duels  to determine which one of them will go to the playoffs. Using the  Field Magic Card  " Umi ", Mako gains offensive and defensive bonuses for his monsters as well as hiding them. Eventually, Mako calls forth his " The Legendary Fisherman ", who is immune to  Magic Cards  and monster assaults as long as "Umi" is on the field. To Mako, "The Legendary Fisherman" is the embodiment of his father and also what he aspires to be in life. Mako then Summons " Fortress Whale ", whose power allows him to dominate the field. Joey eventually uses " Panther Warrior " in conjunction with the  Equip Magic Card  " Lightning Blade " in order to weaken the "Fortress Whale" as well as increase the power of the "Panther Warrior". Mako then used his "Legendary Fisherman" as a shield to protect his Life Points but with the removal of "Umi" via Joey's " Giant Trunade ", it was easily destroyed, winning Joey the Duel. Joey won his "Fortress Whale", and Mako gave his "The Legendary Fisherman" to Joey as well to thank Joey. This is Mako's final Duel in the series. Mako was also the only Duelist Joey faced in tournament apart from Seto Kaiba that didn't cheat or twist the game to their own will. 
 Mako is shortly seen along with the rest of the Duelists during the semifinal match between  Seto Kaiba  and  Yugi Muto , in which he marvels at the power of the  Egyptian Gods  " Obelisk the Tormentor " and " Slifer the Sky Dragon ".
 
 
 Dawn of the Duel 
         Mako is seen on a boat in the final episode.     
 In the final episode, Mako is seen on a boat that has a sail that reads "Tairyō" (大漁), which means a large catch of fish. When Kajiki arrives on shore, he encounters the Roba brothers, with  Espa Roba  ready to Duel. This scene is shown only in the original anime as it takes place during the credits.
 
 
 Non-canon appearances 
 Pyramid of Light 
 Mako also makes a cameo in  Yu-Gi-Oh! The Movie: Pyramid of Light  watching the news of  Yugi  being the champion on TV, as well as a montage created by  Maximillion Pegasus  shortly before the final Duel when Pegasus says that everyone Yugi and the Pharaoh met had played a role in what was coming up next.

 In the "Battle City" tournament, he uses a  Umi / WATER  Deck' , it is focused around utilizing the " Umi " field spell to conceal his monsters while also using its support cards such as " Tornado Wall " and " Torrential Tribute " to disrupt his opponent's strategies. Most of his monsters in this deck are  Fish  type from what it seems. He also uses this strategy to gather enough resources for his more powerful  monsters  such as " The Legendary Fisherman " and " Fortress Whale ". While  Seeker  looking up a duelist's rarest cards on his laptop, Fortress Whale was listed as his rarest card, confirmed by Mako himself once he summoned it. He forfeited this card to Joey when he lost, as per Battle City rules, but also gave him The Legendary Fisherman as well, despite it not being his rarest card, as he felt he earned this card with his dueling skills.
