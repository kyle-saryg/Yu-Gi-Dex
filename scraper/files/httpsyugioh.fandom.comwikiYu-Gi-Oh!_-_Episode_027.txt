 Summary 
 The  Duel  continues between  Seto Kaiba  and  Maximillion Pegasus . Pegasus talks about cartoons he once watched as a child and activates " Toon World ", which will allow Pegasus's  monsters  to jump into "Toon World" and keep them safe from Kaiba's attacks. In addition to this, "Toon World" can transform all of Pegasus's monsters into  Toon Monsters . He then makes Seto upset when he  Summons  his " Blue-Eyes White Dragon " and uses "Toon World" to transform it into " Blue-Eyes Toon Dragon ".
 Kaiba abandons his hand, and starts  Top-Decking . He Summons "Blue-Eyes White Dragon" and uses it to attack "Blue-Eyes Toon Dragon", but the Toon dragon dodges the attack. Pegasus explains that this was based off a concept from  Funny Bunny , where the main character of the show,  Funny Bunny  was able to avoid everything that  Ruff Ruff McDogg  tried to do in his attempt to stop his cartoony antics.
 Later, Kaiba draws " Shadow Spell " and  activates  it, immobilizing the Toon Dragon and lowering its  ATK  by 700, so "Blue-Eyes White Dragon" can then  destroy  it. Pegasus then activates " Dragon Capture Jar " to capture "Blue-Eyes White Dragon". On Pegasus's next  turn , he  Normal Summons  " Dragon Piper ". Kaiba already figures that Pegasus will use the effect of "Dragon Piper" on his next turn to release "Blue-Eyes White Dragon" and use "Toon World" to transform it into a Toon monster.
 Kaiba immediately  Flip Summons  " Swordstalker " and uses it to attack "Dragon Piper", but Pegasus uses " Doppleganger " to activate the effect of Kaiba's " Crush Card " as the effect of "Doppleganger". After "Swordstalker" destroys "Dragon Piper", "Crush Card" destroys virtually all the cards in Seto's Deck. After Kaiba  Decks out , Pegasus seals his soul inside a card.
 
 Featured Duel: Seto Kaiba vs. Maximillion Pegasus 
 
 This Duel uses  Duelist Kingdom  gameplay. Rules and  card effects  may differ from that of the  TCG / OCG . See the individual card articles for more information.     
 Duel continues from the previous episode . 
 Kaiba  has 1000  LP  remaining and  controls  " Rude Kaiser " (1800/1600) in  Defense Position  and no  Set  cards. 
 Pegasus  has 1400 LP remaining and  controls  "Dark Rabbit" (2200/1500), affected by " Negative Energy ", in  Attack Position  and no Set cards.
 Turn 8: Kaiba 
Kaiba  draws . He then Sets a  monster .
 Turn 9: Pegasus 
Pegasus draws " Toon World " and subsequently  activates  it. Now any monsters Pegasus controls can be transformed into  Toon Monsters . Also any monsters that are within the pages of "Toon World" cannot be  attacked  by Kaiba's monsters. "Dark Rabbit" attacks and  destroys  Kaiba's Set " Battle Ox " (1700/1000). Pegasus uses the  effect  of "Toon World" to hide "Dark Rabbit" within its pages.
 Turn 10: Kaiba 
Kaiba draws. He then Sets a card.
 Turn 11: Pegasus 
Pegasus draws. He then  Normal Summons  " Blue-Eyes White Dragon " (3000/2500) in Attack Position. Pegasus then uses the effect of "Toon World" to transform "Blue-Eyes White Dragon" into " Blue-Eyes Toon Dragon " (3000/2500). "Blue-Eyes Toon Dragon" attacks and destroys "Rude Kaiser".
 Turn 12: Kaiba 
Kaiba, at this point, decides to abandon his  hand  and start  Top-Decking . He draws "Blue-Eyes White Dragon" and subsequently Normal Summons it (3000/2500) in Attack Position. "Blue-Eyes White Dragon" attacks "Blue-Eyes Toon Dragon", but "Blue-Eyes Toon Dragon" dodges the attack as "Blue-Eyes White Dragon" is not a Toon monster.
 Turn 13: Pegasus 
Pegasus draws. He then activates " Shine Palace " to increase the  ATK  of "Blue-Eyes Toon Dragon" by 500 ("Blue-Eyes Toon Dragon": 3000 → 3500/2500). "Blue-Eyes Toon Dragon" attacks "Blue-Eyes White Dragon", but Kaiba activates his face-down " Negate Attack " to  negate  the attack and end the  Battle Phase .
 Turn 14: Kaiba 
Kaiba draws " Shadow Spell " and subsequently activates it to immobilize "Blue-Eyes Toon Dragon" and decrease its ATK by 700 ("Blue-Eyes Toon Dragon": 3500 → 2800/2500). "Blue-Eyes White Dragon" attacks and destroys "Blue-Eyes Toon Dragon" (Pegasus: 1400 → 1200 LP).
 Turn 15: Pegasus 
Pegasus draws " Dragon Capture Jar " and subsequently activates it. Upon activation, "Dragon Capture Jar" is  Special Summoned  as an  Effect Monster  (100/200) in Defense Position. "Blue-Eyes White Dragon" is then absorbed into "Dragon Capture Jar" due to its effect. The  DEF  of "Dragon Capture Jar" then increases by the DEF of "Blue-Eyes White Dragon" ("Dragon Capture Jar": 100/200 → 2700).
 Turn 16: Kaiba 
Kaiba draws a monster and subsequently Sets it.
 Turn 17: Pegasus 
Pegasus draws. He then Sets one card and Normal Summons " Dragon Piper " (200/1800) in Defense Position. Pegasus intends to  switch  "Dragon Piper" into Attack Position during his next  turn . Once he does that, the effect of "Dragon Piper" will activate, releasing "Blue-Eyes White Dragon" from "Dragon Capture Jar" and placing "Blue-Eyes White Dragon" under Pegasus' control. Pegasus will then use "Toon World" to transform the released "Blue-Eyes" into a Toon monster.
 Turn 18: Kaiba 
Kaiba draws. He then  Flip Summons  " Swordstalker " (2000/1600) in Attack Position. "Swordstalker" attacks "Dragon Piper", but Pegasus activates his face-down " Doppleganger " to activate the effect of Kaiba's " Crush Card ", infecting "Dragon Piper". "Swordstalker" destroys "Dragon Piper", but this activates the effect of "Crush Card", destroying "Swordstalker" and all monsters in Kaiba's  Deck  that have 1500 or more ATK. Seto activates " Reborn the Monster " to revive " Saggi the Dark Clown " (600/1500) in Defense Position.
 Turn 19: Pegasus 
Pegasus Normal Summons " Bickuribox " (2300/2000) in Attack Position. "Bickuribox" attacks and destroys "Saggi the Dark Clown". Since Kaiba's Deck is now  empty , he loses by default.
