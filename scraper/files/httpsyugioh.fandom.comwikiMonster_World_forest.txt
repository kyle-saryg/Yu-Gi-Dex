 Events 
 At the start of the game, Yugi and his friends, who played the role of the adventurers, went to a  village , to get information.  Mr. Karita , who was forced to play the role of "Villager D" warned the adventurers to stay out of the forest as it was full of monsters. [2] 
 The adventurers later encountered  Zorc , who was disguised as an injured man. He told the adventurers that he had been attacked in the forest and robbed of his sword, which was capable of defeating Zorc. He asked the adventurers for help. Although they had been warned to stay away from the forest, they decided to help him. [1] 
 Inside the forest, the adventurers encountered five monsters. They managed to tame  Pokii  and defeat the other four, after which Zorc revealed himself. [1]
