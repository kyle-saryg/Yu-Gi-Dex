 Yu-Gi-Oh! Online: Duel Evolution  was a major update from " Yu-Gi-Oh! Online ", that changed many aspects of the game. Players now have their own avatars and can explore portions of  Domino City  from the original  Yu-Gi-Oh!  series and the  Duel Academy  from the  Yu-Gi-Oh! GX  series. The dueling screen and the Deck editor have also been redesigned and improved.
 One of the latest improvements of this game are the NPCs. They exist in both Domino City and Duel Academy. NPCs are both characters that are featured in the series such as  Yami Yugi ,  Seto Kaiba ,  Jaden Yuki ,  Alexis Rhodes  and characters that aren't featured in the series.
 In December of 2009, a new version called  Yu-Gi-Oh! Online 3: Duel Accelerator  replaced  Duel Evolution , making it defunct.

 Cards 
 Players would duel using cards, in the same way as in the Yu-Gi-Oh! Trading Card Game. Each player starts with a 40-60 card starter Deck. After that, players needed to duel to get more cards. Whenever a single game (1 duel) is played, both players get 1 card from a card pack of their choice. Whenever a match game (2 or 3 duels, first to win twice wins) is played, both players get 3 cards from a card pack of their choice.
 
       Main Screen     
 Cards could also be obtained through trading (only if the player has played 36 or more duels) or exchanging Mileage Points ( MP ).  MP  is earned in amounts for claiming duel pass codes, and could be used to buy some of the game's more sought-after cards (such as  Doomcaliber Knight , and  Grandmaster of the Six Samurai ). Since the update to Duel Evolution,  MP  is being done in the form of a Duel Shop, where packs, single cards and custom parts for your avatar can be purchased. Buying packs through these stores gives you 5 random cards from that pack, rather than the usual 1 or 3.
 
 
         Packs Selection     
 The game includes cards from  OCG  boosters up to and including  Light of Destruction , as well as a variety of OCG promos.
 
 Ranking 
 There are 30 player Levels, Levels 1 through 30. Once a player has played at least 36 duels, he or she can advance beyond Level 1, and must to move from the beginner's lobby to the other lobbies where all players Level 2 and above play.
 
         Player Look Editing     
 The player's Level is decided by their score. Each time a player wins a duel, that player's score increases, and whenever a player loses a duel, their score decreases. The amount of points received or deducted depends on the player's level and the opponent's level. For example, a Level 2 player winning from a Level 5 player would gain more points than a Level 6 player winning from a Level 3 player.
 
 Events

 Payment 
 To duel, players must spend  Duelpass Points  ( DP ). It costs 1 DP for 1 duel. Duelpass points are obtained by purchasing Duelpasses. Purchasing a Duelpass gains the player 30 Duelpass Points, 1 card in the game, and 10 Mileage (that players can exchange for cards). Ten Duelpass points are given for free to every account when they are first created.

 Duelpass 150 
 This is an online purchase that is equivalent to 5 Duelpasses (150 Duelpass points). The 5 cards gained from this type of Duelpass are chosen randomly from a set. At one point, sale of the Duelpass 150 was suspended in the United States due to fraud, but since the release of Duel Evolution, the Duelpass 150 is available in United States again.
 
 USB Duelpass Key 
 The  USB Duelpass Key  is equivalent to 3 Duelpasses (90 Duelpass points). It is a USB device that is sold in retail stores in the United States, such as Toys 'R' Us and Target. It works like a standard USB flash drive, except it only contains the information necessary to transfer game credits to your account. A CD-ROM with the full version of the game is included in the packaging for the USB Duelpass Key. The flashdrive itself has only 128K or so of memory, unusable for anything but the duel pass credits. The 3 cards gained from this type of duelpass are chosen randomly from a set. The USB Duelpass Key is sold only in the United States and Mexico. Players in other locations must get duelpasses from one of the other methods or buy them from a third party.
 
 SMS Duelpass 
 The  SMS Duelpass  is available in the United Kingdom to date and for a charge of £1 you gain 15 Duel Points and 10MP. It's a quick and popular way of obtaining Duel Points.
