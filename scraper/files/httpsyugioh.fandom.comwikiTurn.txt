 Turn  (Japanese: ターン  tān ) is the way of ordering a play sufficiently between  players  during a  Duel , when a player can choose their actions based on their cards' effects and the order of the phases. Also unofficially called " Round ".
 Every turn is divided into the six following  phases :
 
 Draw Phase 
 Standby Phase 
 Main Phase 1 
 Battle Phase 
 Main Phase 2 
 End Phase 
 The  turn player  must go through one or more of these phases until they've finished their  End Phase . 
 As a Deck can only have up 60 cards, unless card effects require additional draws, there are only 120 turns in total. 
 
 Rules 
 A turn could only begin when a player has conducted a phase out of the six phases, usually off first with the  Draw Phase . A turn could only end after an  End Phase .
