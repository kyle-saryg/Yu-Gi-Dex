 The International version of " The Forgiving Maiden " is completely redrawn, to avoid religious connotation as the woman in the Japanese artwork is drawn to look like a nun. When this card is shown in the international  anime , the person's face (or mask) that she had her hand over was recolored to blend in with the shadows of her habit.
