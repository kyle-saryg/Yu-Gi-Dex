 Reason for challenge 
 Convinced that Miho is his destined love, Warashibe tries to woo her but fails. Thinking that Yugi's friends are the ones that caused his failure, Warashibe causes Yugi's friends (minus Miho) to fall sick by drinking contaminated water. Miho realizes this and challenges Warashibe to a game of Capmon.
 Later, after discovering that Warashibe cheated by rigging the capsule machine, Miho decides not to play the game. Warashibe refuses to let Miho out, accidentally injuring her in the process. Yami Yugi then shows up and takes Miho's place in the game.
