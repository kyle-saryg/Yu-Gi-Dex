A  searcher  is any card which allows you to  see  the entire  Main Deck  to look for a card(s) from it.
 When an effect requires you to search for a card of a specific type in your Deck, then you must  reveal  the card to your opponent.
 After every “search”, the Deck must be  shuffled  (in case of searching for a card to place on the top or the bottom of the Deck, the Deck is shuffled before placing the card).
