A  Reprint  is when a card which has been featured in a previous pack is re-released in a different pack or as a limited edition in a special edition box or a collective pack such as  Dark Beginning 1  or for the  OCG   Beginner's Edition 1 . An example card is " Exodia the Forbidden One " which first appeared in  Legend of Blue Eyes White Dragon  but was reprinted in the  Dark Beginning 1   Booster Pack .
 Usually the rarity of a card remains equal or declines when featured in a Reprint-Pack. For example, all pieces of "Exodia" were first released as  Ultra Rares  in  Legend of Blue Eyes White Dragon , but only the "head" remained an  Ultra Rare  whilst the other pieces are  Common  in  Dark Beginning 1 . In some cases the rarity of cards increases, such as with " Fusion Gate " and " Coffin Seller ". Increasing the rarity of a card has become somewhat common recently due to the releases of  Special Edition  cards and  Turbo Packs .
 Reprints often serves to bring back a card a player usually need ( Staple ,  Toolbox  or  Splashable  cards). The most notable case is " Mystical Space Typhoon " with more than 20 reprints, albeit most of them are as  Common .
 Reprint also serves to  errata  the card: Either to update the text to the latest version ( Problem-Solving Card Text ) or modify its effect. The latter category serves to lower the power of a cards on the Forbidden List, and thus, making them more usable. Most notable cards include " Future Fusion " and " Ring of Destruction ".
