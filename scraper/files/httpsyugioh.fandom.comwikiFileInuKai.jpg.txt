 Mad Dog , known as  Mad Dog Inukai  in the Japanese version, is  Zane Truesdale 's opponent in Zane's first Underground Duel.
 In the Japanese version, "Mad Dog" is his nickname, and translated literally, his given name means "dog owner". In the English dub, his voice is an imitation/parody of  Mike Tyson ; excluding his growls, his voice is very high-pitched and childish, contrasting with his physical appearance.

 Biography 
 Mad Dog was an Underground  Duelist . He defeated twenty Duelists in a row and earned the title, "Gatekeeper of Hell". [1] 
 In an  Underground Dueling bar , Mad Dog faced an arranged opponent,  Zane Truesdale , who had been relegated from the  Pro League , following a losing streak (after losing to  Aster Phoenix ).  Mr. Shroud  told Zane that beating Mad Dog would help put him back on top. As the  Duel  began, Mad Dog taunted Zane, by calling him "Pro League Dog". Both players had  electrodes  strapped to them, so that they would receive high voltage shocks each time they took damage. Mad Dog was aware of the cards Zane used and was able to counter them. He quickly lowered Zane's  Life Points  to 300 and raised his own to 15000. Zane became frustrated by his losing streak and abandoned his respectful way of Dueling, in favor of more ruthless strategies. Zane Summoned " Chimeratech Overdragon " at 4800  ATK  and attacked Mad Dog repeatedly, dropping his Life Points to 0, knocking him out and blasting open the cage. [1] 
 
 Deck 
 Mad Dog plays a  " Slime   Virus " Deck  which focuses on various disrupting strategies meant to impede his opponents' ability to  activate  cards in addition to cards that gradually inflict  effect damage  under such circumstances such as " Last Machine Acid Virus ". He also includes a number of cards that increase his  draw  power. [1]
