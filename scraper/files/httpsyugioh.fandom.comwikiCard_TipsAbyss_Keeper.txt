 Link Summon  this card using " Deep Sea Diva " and a " Neptabyss, the Atlantean Prince " that it summons from your Deck. Use "Neptabyss'" effect before Link Summoning this card, in order to then Special Summon " Superancient Deepsea King Coelacanth " and enable its effect without needing cards in hand other than "Coelacanth" and "Deep Sea Diva".
 By using this card as an enabler for "Coelacanth", you not only enable this card's banish effect, but also a means to sidestep this card's  Link Material  restrictions by Link Summoning " I:P Masquerena ".
