 Differences in adaptations 
 A graphic showing how many  Star Chips  Yugi and Joey have is removed from the dub. 
 Cut from the dub: Mai taunts Yugi and his friends that the way they stick together are like ducks in a past life, and a mother duck being followed by her ducklings behind Yugi and friends. 
 In the original, " Flame Swordsman " has a yellow background, in the dub it has a purple background, because the real card is a Fusion monster, although Joey never plays it as one.
