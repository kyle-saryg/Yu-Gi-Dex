 Trivia 
 Lumis and Umbra's in-game appearance is based off of their depiction in the manga, and not their redesign for the anime. 
 The inclusion of " Valkyrion the Magna Warrior " as card-specific dialogue references how the team took control of the Monster from Yami Yugi via the effect of " Masked Beast Des Gardius ". 
 The inclusion of the explosion-themed cards " Widespread Ruin " and " Blast with Chain " as card-specific dialogue references Lumis and Umbra's Duel location being lined with explosives with the intent of killing the loser. 
 The inclusion of the chain-themed cards " Binding Chain " and " Darkworld Shackles " references Lumis' Duelist's Chastity Belt used to bind Kaiba's Duel Disk and prevent it from being used. 
 When starting a Duel with  Yami Yugi  or  Seto Kaiba (DM) , Umbra announces "Your Egyptian Gods are useless against me!" followed by Lumis announcing "I’ll defeat you and take your Egyptian God Card." 
 Lumis and Umbra,  Seto Kaiba (DSOD) ,  Mokuba Kaiba (DSOD) ,  Yugi Muto (DSOD) ,  Joey Wheeler (DSOD) ,  Téa Gardner (DSOD) ,  Scud ,  Jesse Anderson ,  Yusei Fudo ,  Jack Atlas ,  Crow Hogan ,  Akiza Izinski ,  Leo ,  Luna ,  Tetsu Trudge ,  Dark Signer Kalin Kessler ,  Dark Signer Carly Carmine ,  Kalin Kessler , and  Carly Carmine  have additional character-specific dialogue that is generic, due to having the same dialogue when Dueling against certain Legendary Duelists. 
 The Paradox Brothers , Lumis and Umbra, and  Yuma and Astral  are the only characters that consist of 2 Duelists as a playable tset.
 In addition, The Paradox Brothers and Lumis and Umbra are the only characters whose respective ace cards, "Masked Beast Des Gardius" and " Gate Guardian ", are not of UR rarity. The former being SR, and the latter being R.
 Ironically both ace cards can not be obtained as a drop reward from Dueling the said characters. Instead, "Masked Beast Des Gardius" is obtained as a drop reward from  Yami Marik , whereas "Gate Guardian" is obtained from the card trader, and " Number 39: Utopia " is obtained from the card pack. 
 The Paradox Brothers,  Arkana , Lumis and Umbra,  Aigami ,  Sera ,  Prana , Jesse Anderson,  Alexis Rhodes ,  Dr. Vellian Crowler ,  Bastion Misawa ,  Tyranno Hassleberry ,  Sartorius Kumar ,  Blair Flannigan , Yusei Fudo, Dark Signer Kalin Kessler, Kalin Kessler, and  Reginald Kastle  are the Legendary Duelists who have dialogue for cards that are non-existent, unreleased, anime-exclusive, or video game-exclusive. It is uncertain as to why these cards were found in the voice files, or if these said cards will be released in the future.
 Lumis and Umbra's dialogue for such cards include: " Mask of Impregnability ".
