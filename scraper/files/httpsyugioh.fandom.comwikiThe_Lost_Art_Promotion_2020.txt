 The Lost Art Promotion  is a promotion in the  TCG  in which the Asian artworks of cards are distributed, with a different card being released each month.
 The cards were originally scheduled to be released in two 3-month periods. During the first 3-month period, the cards were released monthly from January to March 2020 in North America and Latin America, and from February to April 2020 in Europe and Oceania. During the second 3-month period, the cards were to be released monthly from June to August 2020.
 Konami announced a 12 card expansion to the 2020 Lost Art Promotion, as well as an accelerated release of cards, due to the COVID-19 Pandemic forcing the closure of many OTS stores. [1] 
 Due to the expansion, the new promotional cards were released between April and December 2020 in North America and Latin America.
