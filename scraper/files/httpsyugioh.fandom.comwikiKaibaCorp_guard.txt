 Biography 
 Death-T 
 He accompanied  Mokuba Kaiba  and  Saruwatari  on the way to Mokuba's game of  Capsule Monster Chess  with  Dark Yugi  in  Death T-4 . He and Saruwatari held Yugi's friends:  Anzu Mazaki ,  Katsuya Jonouchi  and  Johji  at gunpoint, while Mokuba faced Yugi. The two of them were to kill Yugi's friends if Dark Yugi lost. [1] 
 After Mokuba's defeat, he and Saruwatari brought Yugi's friends up to the  Dome Duel Arena  to watch Dark Yugi face Seto Kaiba in  Death T-5 . [2] 
 When Kaiba lost, he continued to hold them at gunpoint, until  Hiroto Honda  appeared and hit him in the back of the head, knocking him down. While Jonouchi and Honda attacked Saruwatari, he got back to his feet, grabbed Jonouchi and held a gun to his face. However, Mokuba appeared and ordered him to let them go. [3] 
 
 Duelist Kingdom 
       The guard's gun getting jammed.     
 He traveled with Seto Kaiba to  Duelist Kingdom  via a helicopter, whose pilot was also a spy. When he realized that Kaiba was suspicious of what was going on, he held a gun to his head. Before being shot, Kaiba asked requested that he move his cards, so that they don't get blood on them. Kaiba then managed to use the card " Gyakutenno Megami " to jam the gun. Kaiba grabbed the gun, snapping his finger and ordered the two spies to jump out of the helicopter into the ocean. [4]
