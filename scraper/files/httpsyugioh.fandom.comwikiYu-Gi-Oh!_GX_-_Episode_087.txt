 Summary 
   This summary is currently incomplete. 
 Chazz Princeton  defeats  Gelgo , a Professional Duelist and wins his numerous  Genex Medallions  using his  White Knight deck . He challenges  Jaden Yuki  to a Duel, to take place the next day. Jaden asks why Chazz isn't using his  Ojama Trio  cards, and Chazz responds that he has no idea what Jaden is talking about, but then says he vaguely recalls throwing out cards like that the  the other day  and thinks they landed in the ocean.
 Back at the White Dorm, Chazz is unable to remember why he even joined the  Society of Light  in the first place and can only vaguely remember the Ojamas.  Bastion Misawa  arrives and tells Chazz it's time for the meeting and reveals he has dyed his hair white. Chazz comments that he hasn't seen  Sartorius  lately, and Bastion responds that he heard a rumor he's been feeling fatigued. At the meeting, three Society of Light students make a brief speech about using the power of light to destroy the darkness. Bastion,  Alexis Rhodes  and the rest of the Society members are quite enthralled by the speech, while Chazz's mind wanders elsewhere.
 Meanwhile, Jaden is in the ocean by the shore, trying to find Chazz's Ojama cards. Later, Jaden is rebuilding his deck for his Duel with Chazz and the spirit of  Lyman Banner  contacts him. After questioning where he came from, Banner reveals that as his spirit attempted to pass on the afterlife, it was eaten by  Pharaoh . He says he can't sleep because he is hearing a strange voice. His spirit leads Jaden to  the well  where Chazz had  orignally  found " Ojama Black " and " Ojama Green " before his Duel with  Slade Princeton . The three Ojama cards are there. They tell beg Jaden to save them from crabs that are attempting to cut them.
 The Ojama Trio asks if Jaden can help Chazz; and feel that if they returned to him at this point, he would just throw them away again. Jaden offers to put the Trio in his deck for his Duel with Chazz, which they accept, being excited about being able to fight beside  Heroes . The next, day, Chazz and Jaden meet outside the main entrance to   Duel Academy 's main building, with Jaden bringing Chazz's old black uniform along with him. Chazz reaffirms his devotion to the Society of Light, but mentally feels strange at seeing the jacket, as some of his former memories return to him.
 Chazz dominates the early stages of the Duel, and Jaden is reduced to 400 Life Points.
 
 Featured Duels 
 Chazz Princeton vs. Gelgo 
 Duel already in progress.  Chazz  has " White Knight Swordsman " (1200/1200) on the  field  in  Attack Position  and 4000  Life Points . Gelgo's field is empty and he has 2600 Life Points.
 Gelgo's turn 
Gelgo draws " Marshmallon " and subsequently Normal Summons it (300/500) in  Defense Position .
 Chazz's turn 
Chazz draws " White Knight Lancer " and subsequently Normal Summons it (1500/0) in Attack Position. He then activates " Infernal Gauntlet " and equips it to "White Knight Lancer". Now during the Battle Phase, Chazz can Tribute one monster besides "White Knight Lancer" to allow "White Knight Lancer" one additional attack in addition to its normal attack, however "White Knight Lancer" won't be allowed to attack directly. As Chazz enters his Battle Phase, he  activates  the effect of "Infernal Gauntlet" to  Tribute  "White Knight Swordsman" and allow "White Knight Lancer" to attack twice. Since "White Knight Swordsman" is now in the  Graveyard , its effect raises the  ATK  of all  face-up  " White Knight "  monsters  by 300 ("White Knight Lancer": 1500 → 1800/0). 
 "White Knight Lancer" attacks "Marshmallon". "Marshmallon" is not destroyed due to its effect, however "White Knight Lancer" then inflicts  piercing  damage to Gelgo (Gelgo 2600 → 1300). "White Knight Lancer" attacks "Marshmallon" again. "Marshmallon" is not destroyed due to its effect, however "White Knight Lancer" then inflicts piercing damage to Gelgo (Gelgo 1300 → 0).
 
 Jaden Yuki vs. Chazz Princeton 
 Turn 1: Chazz 
 Chazz  draws " White Knight Swordsman " and subsequently Normal Summons it (1200/1200) in  Attack Position . He then  Sets  a card ("The Sealed Gates").
 Turn 2: Jaden 
 Jaden  draws. He then Normal Summons " Elemental Hero Sparkman " (1600/1400) in Attack Position. He then  activates  " Good Hero " to  Special Summon  " Ojama Yellow " (0/1000) from his Deck in Attack Position (as the ATK and DEF of "Ojama Yellow" are both at most 1000) and equip it with "Good Hero". Due to the effect of "Good Hero", "Ojama Yellow" gains 300 ATK for each face-up " Elemental Hero " on the  field  ("Ojama Yellow": 0 → 300/1000). "Sparkman"  attacks  and  destroys  "White Knight Swordsman" (Chazz 4000 → 3600). "Ojama Yellow" attacks  directly  (Chazz 3600 → 3300). Jaden then Sets a card ("Over Limit").
 Turn 3: Chazz 
Chazz draws " White Knight Lancer " and subsequently Normal Summons it (1500/0) in Attack Position. Due to the effect of the "White Knight Swordsman" in Chazz's Graveyard, all White Knight monsters gain 300 ATK ("White Knight Lancer": 1500 → 1800/0). "White Knight Lancer" attacks and destroys "Ojama Yellow" (Jaden 4000 → 2500). Jaden then activates his face-down " Over Limit ". Now while this card is face-up, Jaden can pay 500 Life Points to Special Summon a Normal Monster with 1000 or less ATK from either player's Graveyard as long as the monster he's summoning was destroyed in battle this turn. Jaden then uses the effect of "Over Limit" (Jaden 2500 → 2000) to Special Summon "Ojama Yellow" (0/1000) from his Graveyard in  Defense Position .
 Turn 4: Jaden 
Jaden draws " Shield Attack ". Jaden's hand contains "Ojama Green", "Ojama Black", and " Ojamandala ". Jaden then Normal Summons " Ojama Green " (0/1000) in Defense Position and switches "Sparkman" to Defense Position.
 Turn 5: Chazz 
Chazz draws " Tribute to the Doomed " and subsequently activates it to  discard  "White Knight Swordsman" and destroy "Sparkman" ("White Knight Lancer": 1800 → 2100/0). "White Knight Lancer" attacks and destroys "Ojama Green". "White Knight Lancer" then inflicts piercing damage to Jaden (Jaden 2000 → 900). Chazz then Normal Summons " White Knight Gardna " (800/2000) in Defense Position. Jaden then uses the effect of "Over Limit" (Jaden 900 → 400) to Special Summon "Ojama Green" from his Graveyard (0/1000) in Defense Position.
 Turn 6: Jaden 
Jaden draws. He then Normal Summons " Ojama Black " (0/1000) in Defense Position. Jaden then activates " Ojama Delta Hurricane!! " to destroy all cards on Chazz's side of the field. Since " Sealed Gate " was destroyed and sent to the Graveyard, its effect activates, allowing Chazz to  remove  one "White Knight Swordsman", "White Knight Lancer" and "White Knight Gardna" in his Graveyard from play and Special Summon " White Knight Lord " (2000 → 2300/2000) in Attack Position.
 Duel continues in  the next episode .

 Differences in adaptations 
 In the Japanese version, Manjoume tells Judai that he has a score to settle with him, but doesn't remember what for, causing Judai to fall to the ground. In the dub, Chazz sarcastically asks Jaden if he was on another planet when Jaden asks for clarification if he's the one Chazz wants a rematch with. Jaden takes this literally, and Jaden falls to the ground (or was hit by Aster) as he realizes Chazz was being sarcastic. 
 In the dub Aster mentions that Gelgo almost beat him during his duel with Chazz. This is not present in the original where he simply comments on Gelgo's deck.
