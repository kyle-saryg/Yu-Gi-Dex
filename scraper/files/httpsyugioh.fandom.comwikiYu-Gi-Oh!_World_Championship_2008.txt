 "Tournament dueling is back with the official software of  Yu-Gi-Oh! World Tournament 2008 ! Battle it out on two exciting game modes: "World Championship" mode, and the new "Duel World" mode, where you can venture through events, meet duel spirits, and buy new cards."
 
 Trivia/Glitches 
 " Yubel ", " Crystal Seer ", " Kozaky ", and " Nurse Reficule the Fallen One " are all available in this game as Duel spirits, but none are available as playable cards. 
 The second effect of " Rainbow Dragon " can be activated by the opponent during either player's turn. 
 " Arcana Force EX - The Light Ruler ", under the name "Arcana Force  Extra  - The Light Ruler", is the only " Arcana Force " monster available in this game. 
 The card lore of " Rain Storm " is incorrectly replaced by the lore for " Elemental Hero Chaos Neos ". 
 " Dimension Distortion " does not allow you to  Special Summon  your opponent's  removed from play  monsters. 
 The card lore of " Exodius the Ultimate Forbidden Lord " does not tell you that you can also send a monster from your Deck to the Graveyard when "Exodius" attacks. 
 In previous games, the  Egyptian God  cards were always either  illegal  or  Forbidden ; in this game, they are all  Limited  for the first time, allowing players to put one of each Egyptian God card into their Deck. 
 All the promotional cards that are included with the game are used by  Adrian Gecko  in the anime. 
 Most of the " Archfiend " series of cards are not available within the game. 
 The following  Fusion Material Monsters  are absent from the game, despite the  Fusion Monsters  formed from these Monsters being included in the game:
 Armaill 
 Cave Dragon 
 Divine Dragon Ragnarok 
 Enchanting Mermaid 
 Fairy Dragon 
 Firegrass 
 Frontier Wiseman 
 Fusionist 
 Giga-Tech Wolf 
 Guardian of the Labyrinth 
 Lesser Fiend 
 M-Warrior #1 
 M-Warrior #2 
 Mystical Sheep #2 
 One-Eyed Shield Dragon 
 Petit Angel 
 Possessed Dark Soul 
 Sea Kamen 
 Skull Red Bird 
 Spirit Ryu 
 Warrior Dai Grepher 
 Zone Eater 
 Due to the absence of the above monsters, " Fiend Skull Dragon ", " Dark Balter the Terrible ", " Ryu Senshi " and " Aqua Dragon " cannot be  Fusion Summoned  in this game and subsequent  World Championship  games for the Nintendo DS; only  Special Summoned  by specific card effects. The first two cannot be summoned by " Instant Fusion " because they follow  Strict Fusion Summon  requirements. Similarly, "Ryu Senshi" does not allow materials to be substituted for its Fusion Summon while "Aqua Dragon" would require more  Fusion Substitute Monsters  than is allowed. 
 After you defeat an opponent 10 times, they are added to your Tag Partner list.
 If you choose a tag partner in World Championship Mode that has Tag Duel partner, and you go to Tag Tournament with that partner, your partner will have their Tag Duel deck instead of their normal deck. For example, if Jaden Yuki was your tag partner, and you entered a Tag Tournament, his deck would be the deck he uses with Jesse Andersen (Spiritual Guidance) instead of the deck he uses in Single Duel (Dark Heroes). This change of deck will continue back into World Championship mode until you Single Duel the tag partner, which will reset their deck to the Single Duel deck.
 This also extends to Tag Duelists you haven't unlocked. Say you have Yami Yugi in Single Duel unlocked, but not in Tag Duels. If you enter Tag Tournament, Yami Yugi's Tag Partner deck will change (from 1000 yr. Memories to Ties that Bind). 
 A Stone Seal appears in an area after you beat every opponent in that area 5 times.
