 Him? 
 In the biography section, the last sentence says that Kiryu seperated Yusei and Crow so that he could duel with him. Who is  him ?  DinoQueen13  18:09, 8 November 2008 (UTC)
 
 That would be meaning Yusei if else it is unclear it would be good to change that last part.  User:DracoX 
 Protagonist 
 Why can't Crow be added to the protagonists' character list, since he is a major character in the story.  superlogan7437  23:32, 31 January 2009 (UTC)
 
 A protagnoist isn't necessarily a major character, who's one of the "good guys". Crow is a major character alright, but since he's not a main character, I think he falls short of being a protagonist. --  Deltaneos  ( talk ) 23:54, 31 January 2009 (UTC) 
 Do you think he falls short of being a protagonist now, with the dragon's tail thus being the fifth signer?  —This unsigned comment was made by  205.130.19.211  ( talk  •  contribs ) 22:52, 4 July 2009 (UTC) 
 No. I think Yusei is the only real protagonist. It doesn't matter anyway now that the navbox isn't split by protagonists and antagonists. --  Deltaneos  ( talk ) 23:04, 4 July 2009 (UTC) 
 Crow becomes the fifth signer! He has the dragon tail on his arm! Yusei 
now has the dragon's head!!  —This unsigned comment was made by  71.80.178.243  ( talk  •  contribs ) 14:22, 1 July 2009 (UTC) 
 Crow is the only one with a playable deck.He should be a protagonist.Crow, in real life, is the only one with a deck that stands a chance in tournaments.
 He is the Joey of 5d's, being Yusei's best friend( 98.117.99.70  00:38, February 26, 2010 (UTC))
 
 Dead? 
 is crow dead due to episode 44?  —This unsigned comment was made by  217.44.45.70  ( talk  •  contribs ) 18:39, 5 February 2009 (UTC) 
 Its possible his Dark sIGNER NO. 7 OTHERWISE ITS A WASTE OF CHARACTRISATION, this is the pattern we seem to be following, Bommer, Carly  —This unsigned comment was made by  86.155.31.58  ( talk  •  contribs ) 21:43, 12 February 2009 (UTC) 
 
 Can't say I'd be surprised if Crow became the Condor  —This unsigned comment was made by  75.104.172.139  ( talk  •  contribs ) 00:39, 6 April 2009 (UTC) 
 Obviously you people do not watch the show. Crow survives, and becomes the 5th signer.  —This unsigned comment was made by  71.54.132.152  ( talk  •  contribs ) 19:36, 29 June 2009 (UTC) 
 Obviously you never considered that they may have left those comments before the episodes with those events aired, despite the fact that they most obviously did. --  Deltaneos  ( talk ) 19:46, 29 June 2009 (UTC) 
 Those comments were left 6 months ago long before  episode 64  aired. -- Trivi-AM  19:42, 29 June 2009 (UTC) 
 
 Crow Hogan is a signer. He duel Rex Goodwin and won and then Yusei duel Rex Goodwin a won so Yusei got the dragon's head and Crow got the dragon's tail.Crow is not a bad guy! hHe steals for other people. Like Yusei Crow puts other peoples needs before his.
 
 Deck 
 When did Crow use  Kalut  becuase as far as I'm aware that's the only Blackwing he  hasn't  used, if we saw it when he looked through his deck or something similar, then fine I would just like to know when it was seen on the anime. -- Trivi-AM  20:05, 17 June 2009 (UTC)
 
 Crow Hogan? 
 When was his last name ever stated?  Burnpsy  20:04, 3 July 2009 (UTC)
 
 The character cards in the opening  -OZONE- . --  Deltaneos  ( talk ) 00:37, 4 July 2009 (UTC) 
 I wonder if the last name "Hogan" is in reference to the old show "Hogan's Heroes" ~MEOW~ Might of the BIRD Empire~~  22:47, 13 July 2009 (UTC)

 i almost forgot  ITS IN JAPANEZE  u must watch parts 1/2 and 2/2  —This unsigned comment was made by  97.113.219.90  ( talk  •  contribs ) 23:01, 7 September 2009 (UTC) 
 Yes. That information is already covered on this article. --  Deltaneos  ( talk ) 00:08, September 8, 2009 (UTC) 
 I saw an interview with Tom Wayland. He does Crow.-- 98.111.95.197  ( talk ) 22:50, November 29, 2010 (UTC)
 
 Constant English VA's name change 
 I put a protection that will last a week since apparently Crow won't have much to do in the upcoming episode. I hope that by the time the protection expires, the people who constantly change his name will stop with this fruitless conflict and come to an agreement. Right now,on Wikipedia it says it's Jason Anthony,I'll go with that since I'm not sure if it's true or not PoirotH  12:22, September 20, 2009 (UTC).
 
 Wikipedia is not reliable on the point of voice actors, since it's full of self-admitted Asperger's patients who have mild obsessions with certain voice actors.  I've removed this on Wikipedia, too, until sourcing can be found.  I expect to get people jumping all over me over it, but truth is truth, yanno?  Danny Lilithborne  18:29, November 17, 2009 (UTC) 
 Scusi. I don't edit on here much, but pictures don't lie: I took a screenshot of the VA credits of the english dub and jason griffith was not there. Christopher C. Adams was, however.  red text Dad, I'm a Fairy!  Roxy13  12:03, February 5, 2010 (UTC)Roxy13 
 Could you upload the screenshot or maybe link to a video with credits, please? --  Deltaneos  ( talk ) 13:53, February 5, 2010 (UTC) 
 Sure thing. Here.    File:VoiceActors.jpg     English VA     Hope this helps.  red text Dad, I'm a Fairy!  Roxy13  21:08, February 5, 2010 (UTC)Roxy13 
 I read in TV.com that Jason Anthony Griffith does Crow, while Christopher C. Adams (Pete Capella) did Leo's friend Dexter

 TV.com is no different than this site. Anyone can post information there. You need to know where they are getting the information from if you want to prove it. --  Deltaneos  ( talk ) 22:11, March 17, 2010 (UTC) 
 He either sounds like Dark Sonic or Silver the Hedgehog. I ain't sure.-- 98.111.95.197  01:48, March 26, 2010 (UTC)
 
 Inconsistancy? 
 Am I mistaken or is there inconsistancy in Crow's past? He got the "Black Feather" cards when Pearson died and we see him using them while he was in Team Satisfaction. This implies that the events of him being in Team Satisfaction took place after Pearson's death. However he also got his D-Wheel when Pearson died and in Team Satisfaction's last battle, when Security have D-Wheels, they act as though they have never seen D-Wheels before. This implies that the Team Satisfaction events happened before Pearson's death. Did the writers make a mistake or am I missing something? --  Deltaneos  ( talk ) 18:39, January 27, 2010 (UTC)
 
 Maybe it's because the Security officers weren't expecting a Satellite person to own a D-Wheel, or maybe Crow kept it hidden from Security until that time.  —This unsigned comment was made by  PoirotH  ( talk  •  contribs ) 19:03, 27 January 2010 (UTC) 
 I meant Yusei, Crow, Jack and Kiryu acted like they'd never seen a D-Wheel before. --  Deltaneos  ( talk ) 19:10, January 27, 2010 (UTC) 
 I checked the episode. It was only Kiryu and Yusei who were surprised to see Security with D-Wheels. --  Deltaneos  ( talk ) 19:42, January 27, 2010 (UTC) 
 On this episode Crow clearly states to Yusei that he met Pearson long before meeting Kiryu. So he recived those monsters before joining the team.  DracoX  19:47, January 27, 2010 (UTC) 
 I see. Thank you. --  Deltaneos  ( talk ) 19:52, January 27, 2010 (UTC) 
 No, It says that he get Blackbird after Kiryu was arrested.    Speed Warrior   —Preceding undated comment added 13:23, 28 January 2010 (UTC) 
 When did it say that? --  Deltaneos  ( talk ) 13:29, January 28, 2010 (UTC) 
 When he was talking to yusei  User:Speed Warrior 
 I think youre right, but then that means that Crow wasnt only one using Blackwings monsters then. If so, that means Pearson only inherited his Duel Runner and Blackfeather Dragon to him.  DracoX  17:37, January 28, 2010 (UTC)
 
 reappearance in  ARC-V 
 It has been stated that Crow and  Jack  will reappear in ARC-V, however I don't see any source, can someone please add a source to the page to avoid a false rumor ?  Thunder Eagle  ( talk  •  contribs ) 17:45, March 24, 2015 (UTC)
 
 Added. It really should have been there in the first place, you're right.  Cheesedude  ( talk  •  contribs ) 18:23, March 24, 2015 (UTC) 
 Yes thanks :) However the main  ARC-V  page said  Jack Atlas  and  Crow Hogan  are set to appear in  season 2  as actual characters.   But I can't find anything related to Season 2. Maybe we will see them sooner or even after ep 50, if they confirmd that they will appear in season 2 and not in season 1 than that should be sourced too.  Thunder Eagle  ( talk  •  contribs ) 18:32, March 24, 2015 (UTC)
 
 We don't have any real information on season 2 at all though. Just that it exists. There's no specific source saying they'll be in season 2, its just a logical extrapolation from the fact that we have previews for the rest of the current arc that don't mention them. So that bit should just be removed altogether, becuase as logical as it is, its still speculation.  Cheesedude  ( talk  •  contribs ) 19:05, March 24, 2015 (UTC) 
 That might not be necessary. Season 1 is still going on. Remember that  Yugo  and  Yuzu  teleported away and probably are in the  Synchro Dimension  Maybe Yuzu will meet up with Crow and Jack. Anyway we knew nothing about episode 51 and onwards so I think its not as logical as we might think.

 Dark Signer Plans? 
 I'm sure many have heard rumors on how Crow was intended to become a Dark Signer instead of Rex, but was made to have a larger role in part to push the popular Blackwing archetype. Related to this is the theory that Leo was going to duel Bommer and awaken as the Fifth Signer, but this duel was given to Crow. I've looked for a concrete source to back up this information but cannot find one. Can anyone else verify it, or is it just rumor and speculation?

 Relationships 
 Hi folks, it seems as if the relationships section of Crow's page is almost completely not even filled out. I'm not the best writer but I wanted to be able to highlight it as it seems to have been overlooked.  Eclipse_Coldfire  ( talk  •  contribs ) 05:16, August 2, 2022 (UTC)
