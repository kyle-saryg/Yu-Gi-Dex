 The  fangirl  is an unnamed character in the  Yu-Gi-Oh!  manga . She is a student at  Domino High School , who is easily infatuated by pretty boys or ones with mysterious skills, such as  Kokurano ,  Ryo Bakura  and  Ryuji Otogi .
 
 Biography 
 The girl attended one of  Kokurano 's fortune telling sessions. Kokurano told her that as long as she does not die, she will continue to live. Oblivious to the lack of any actual future being told, bar the obvious, she is easily impressed and foolishly fond of him. [1] 
 While,  Yugi Mutou ,  Katsuya Jonouchi ,  Anzu Mazaki  and  Hiroto Honda  were speaking with  Ryo Bakura , who had just transferred to Domino High, the fangirl and three other girls approached them and told Jonouchi to quit hogging Bakura. The four of them pulled Bakura away and give him a tour of the school. She started to squeal when  Mr. Karita  told Bakura off and asked if he was alright after Karita left. [2] 
 When  Ryuji Otogi  transferred to Domino High, she was once again easily infatuated and admired his dice tricks.
 The fangirl peered in through the window of  Space Burger , while Bakura dined there with his friends. She looked jealously at the other girls, who were sitting with him. [3]
