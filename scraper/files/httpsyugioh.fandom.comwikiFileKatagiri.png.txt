 Design 
 Appearance 
 While using the power of the card, " Rank-Up-Magic Barian's Force ", Devon has a  Barian Emblem  on his forehead. Also, while Dueling like this, Devon is able to Duel without a  Duel Gazer . Instead, his left eye changes to red. Also, he bears an orange  D-Pad , along with a gauntlet similar to  Quattro 's.
 
 Personality 
 Devon is shown to be a very kind person, enjoying Dueling with his fans and signing autographs. When  Girag  brainwashed him, his personality changed drastically and he became very violent and brutal, going as far as to attack  Ray  while he was hurt and then maniacally laughing. When he was defeated by  Yuma , his personality went back to normal.
 In his normal state, his catchphrase after winning a Duel is "Enjoy Duel!". Devon also has a habit of saying "Enthusiastic" ( 熱血 ,  Nekketsu ).
 In the dub version, sometimes he does teaching-puns
 
 Biography 
       The  Barian Emblem  appears on Devon's forehead.     
 Devon appeared at  Heartland Academy , signing autographs for his fans. He was very popular with the female students in particular.  Yuma Tsukumo  wanted to meet him. After signing autographs, he  Dueled   Bronk Stone  and four other students at once, defeating them with " Armed Samurai - Ben Kei ". When he goes to his locker room, he was met by  Girag , who brainwashed him to fight for the  Barian World  using " Rank-Up-Magic Barian's Force ". He immediately searched for Yuma, but was met by  Ray Shadows  instead. He Dueled and defeated Ray with " Coach Captain Bearman ". Yuma arrived and immediately began a Duel with him. Yuma played defensively at first, but Devon countered with an aggressive strategy with " Coach " monsters before bringing out " CXyz Coach Lord Ultimatrainer ". Yuma countered this with " Number C39: Utopia Ray ", defeating him. His brainwashing evaporated after the Duel and he appeared not to remember what had happened. [3] 
 He reappeared on an advertisement for the  Pro Duelist Spartancity Tournament . [4] 
 
 Deck 
 Devon uses a  " Coach " Deck  focused on inflicting large amounts of damage in one instance, whether that be through cards with  ATK  boosting  effects  such as " Armed Samurai - Ben Kei " or through the  effect damage  abilities of his  Xyz Monsters . 
 His Deck also contains at least four  Equip Cards  which he used to power up "Ben Kei" and an unspecified  Trap Card  used in the same Duel.
