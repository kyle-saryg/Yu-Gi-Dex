 Summary 
 Gong  recaps, explaining that the  Battle Royal  turned out to be a plan to select the  Lancers . When  Yuya  found out, he challenged  Declan Akaba  to a Duel in anger. Yuya had declared that for  Zuzu  and all of their sealed comrades, he would make Declan repent, and he had attacked with " Beast-Eyes Pendulum Dragon " for the apparent win, but Declan had survived. Declan explained that the Lancers were intended to fight  Duel Academy  in real combat, and that Yuya would do well to remember that unstable emotions could be a hindrance on the battlefield. Yuya retorted that he didn't intend to be part of the Lancers, and Declan asked if Yuya didn't want to save Zuzu. Yuya was shocked at the implication that Zuzu was still alive.
 Yuya asks if Zuzu is alive, and  Celina  asks Declan if her saw her captured by the  Obelisk Force . Declan doesn't reply, remembering monitoring Zuzu with  Claude  while she was being chased by  Yuri  (it is not made clear whether Declan sees and/or knows about Yuri). Claude asks what the  Shadow   brothers  are doing, as the President told them to prevent Duel Academy from getting their hands on Selena. Declan explains that it's not Celina, but Zuzu Boyle. He states that he doesn't know why, but the two exchanged clothes and swapped identities.  Zuzu's bracelet  glows and Yuri vanishes, much to their confusion, and then  Yugo  ramps over the iceberg in his  Duel Runner  and lands. Claude asks if it is the Duelist from the  Synchro Dimension , and they see Yugo run over to hug Zuzu. Soon, Zuzu's bracelet glows again, and this time both she, Yugo, and Yugo's Duel Runner vanish. Back in the present, Declan thinks that it's clear that Zuzu Boyle wasn't  sealed into a card , and she was most likely not captured by Duel Academy either. But even if he tells Yuya this... He tells Yuya that if he wants to take down Duel Academy and save Zuzu Boyle, Yuya will have to surpass Declan first. In the  Leo Corporation  observation room,  Henrietta  and  Riley  watch the Duel with Claude, Henrietta asking if Declan still plans to add Yuya to the Lancers despite all this hostility. Claude reminds Henrietta that Yuya is the pioneer of Pendulum Summoning, and he explains that Declan said that this is necessary in order to take on Duel Academy. Henrietta is disdainful of this viewpoint, pointing out that Pendulum Summoning is no longer Yuya's alone. 
 The Duel stands with Yuya on 2000 LP and Declan on 1900 LP. Declan declares his turn and he  draws , then he uses the Scale 1 " D/D Savant Galilei " and the Scale 10 " D/D Savant Kepler " to Set the  Pendulum Scale . The two "Savants" rise in the  Pendulum Zones  as Declan explains that he can now Summon monsters from  Levels   2  to  9 . Gong tells  Aura  and  Dennis  that Declan's  Pendulum Summon  is coming, and Declan  chants  "Grand power which shakes my very soul! Arise within me and give birth to a new light that rends the darkness! Pendulum Summon! Appear and come forth! The supreme deity that passes judgment upon the twilight of gods!  D/D/D Oblivion King Abyss Ragnarok ! ((Dub) "Make way for the Embodiment of Despair, Disorder, and Devastation,  Triple D Oblivion King Abyss Ragnarok !")" Declan activates the effect of "Abyss Ragnarok" since it was  Special Summoned , allowing him to Special Summon a " D/D/D " monster from his  Graveyard , and he revives " D/D/D Wave King Caesar ". Yuya thinks that "Abyss Ragnarok" only has 2200  ATK  and "Caesar" 2400; even if he has two "D/D/D" monsters, Declan still doesn't have the power to overcome Yuya's two 3000 ATK  dragons . Declan continues with his turn,  Normal Summoning  " D/D Necro Slime ". Then he activates another effect of "Abyss Ragnarok", allowing him to  Tribute  a monster in order to  banish  one monster that his opponent controls. "Abyss Ragnarok" ensnares "Necro Slime" in its straps and squeezes it into a blue husk, before Declan declares that he is banishing "Rune-Eyes Pendulum Dragon". "Abyss Ragnarok" hefts the glowing husk, which connects with "Rune-Eyes" and banishing it. Yuya curses but Gong reassures everyone that Yuya still has "Beast-Eyes". 
 
       Declan  uses the effect of " D/D Necro Slime " from his  Graveyard .     
 Pointing down, Declan activates the effect of "D/D Necro Slime" from his Graveyard; by banishing it, he can  Fusion Summon  a " D/D "  Fusion Monster . He  fuses  "Abyss Ragnarok" with "Caesar", much to everyone's shock; they realize that Declan can also Pendulum-Fusion Summon. Declan chants, "Crush the twilight of the gods, and open the way to a new world with the force of your surging wave! Fusion Summon! Come before me, autocratic god of limits!  D/D/D Wave Oblivion King Caesar Ragnarok ! ((Dub) "I fuse my Abyss Ragnarok and Wave King Caesar together to form a force that will bring you to your knees. I Fusion Summon!  Triple D Wave Oblivion King Caesar Ragnarok! )" "Caesar Ragnarok" stands with 3200 ATK, higher than "Beast-Eyes", and Declan further activates the effect of "Caesar" since it was sent to the Graveyard, allowing him to add a " Dark Contract " from his Deck to his hand, and he adds " Dark Contract with Renewal ". Declan declares his  Battle Phase , attacking "Beast-Eyes Pendulum Dragon" with "Caesar Ragnarok". He declares, " The End of Judgment ! ("Savage Retribution!" in the dub)" and "Caesar Ragnarok" blasts a surge of blue-energy at "Beast-Eyes", destroying it and reducing Yuya to 1800  LP  as Yuya cries his monster's name. Gong gasps that first "Rune-Eyes" and then Yuya's other Fusion Dragon were both destroyed, and Aura gasps that now Yuya's field is empty. Declan asks if this is all Yuya has got. Yuya reacts in surprise, and Declan tells Yuya that he hasn't given it his all yet, and obviously, neither has Declan. He  Sets  two cards and ends his turn, before telling Yuya that it's his turn. If he wants Declan to go all out, then Declan is sure that Yuya won't be unwilling to show him his all (in the dub, he mentions Zuzu throughout, claiming if this is all Yuya has, then he can't rescue her). Yuya asks again if Zuzu is in the clutches of Duel Academy and he tells Declan to answer him. Declan tells Yuya to defeat him in that case, to Yuya's shock. Declan reminds Yuya that he wanted to make Declan pay, does Yuya mean to say that as long as Zuzu Boyle is alright, whatever happens to Yuya's other sealed comrades doesn't matter? Yuya is shocked by the reminder; he remembers  Reed 's defeat and sees his,  Trout 's, Sun's, and the Knights of the Duel Disks' cards in his mind's eye, and he begins screaming in pain, clutching his head. He recalls  Yuto 's memories of the  Invasion of the Xyz Dimension , and he screams again as  his eyes glow red, his hair begins to spike and he begins emitting darkness . Aura and Gong both yell Yuya's name, and Gong wonders why Declan is provoking Yuya so much. Fortunately, Yuya manages to calm himself down and he shakes his head.
 
       "  Dark Rebellion " attacks " Caesar Ragnarok ."     
 Yuya declares his turn and he draws a card, causing Declan to smile. He chants, "Swing once more, pendulum of the soul! Draw an arc of light across the sky! Pendulum Summon! Revive again from my  Extra Deck ! ((Dub) "Swing far, pendulum! Carve the arc of victory! My monsters are ready to swing into action!")" He Pendulum Summons " Stargazer Magician " and " Odd-Eyes Pendulum Dragon ", and then he Normal Summons " Performapal Pendulum Sorcerer " from his hand. Yuya activates the Pendulum effect of " Xiangsheng Magician ", allowing him to target a monster once per turn and have it become the same Level as another monster. "Xiangsheng Magician" fires an arrow from its bow between "Stargazer Magician" and "Pendulum Sorcerer", and red light covers "Pendulum Sorcerer" while purple light covers "Stargazer", changing "Stargazer" to  Level 4 . Celina observes that Yuya has two Level 4 monsters, and Yuya  overlays  the Level 4 "Stargazer" and "Pendulum Sorcerer", chanting, "Fangs formed from pitch-black darkness, to fight those foolish enough to oppose it! Descend now!  Xyz Summon !  Rank 4 !  Dark Rebellion Xyz Dragon ! ((Dub) "Cloaked in shadows and relentless in its objective, I call upon the most dangerous of dragons! I Xyz Summon  Dark Rebellion Xyz Dragon !")"  Shay  gasps that it's Yuto's dragon, and Declan smiles again, thinking that it's here. Yuya activates the effect of "Dark Rebellion Xyz Dragon",  detaching  an Overlay Unit to halve the ATK of "Caesar Ragnarok" and gain that much ATK. "Dark Rebellion" unfolds its wings and blasts lightning that ensnares "Caesar Ragnarok" and reduces it to 1600 ATK, while increasing "Dark Rebellion" to 4100 ATK with "Treason Discharge". He activates the effect again which prompts Gong to mutter his name, this time reducing "Caesar Ragnarok" to 800 ATK and increasing the ATK of "Dark Rebellion" to 4900. Aura gasps that it's a difference of 4100, and Gong . "Dark Rebellion Xyz Dragon" flares its wings and its tusks glow with lightning as it attacks "Caesar Ragnarok" with "Mauling Mandible Charge". Declan activates the effect of "Caesar Ragnarok", returning "D/D Savant Kepler" to his hand, and then equipping a monster other than the battling monster to "Caesar Ragnarok" and gaining its ATK. "Caesar Ragnarok" ensnares "Odd-Eyes" in its straps, dissolving it into a yellow aura, and rising to 3300 ATK. Then the attack connects, destroying "Caesar Ragnarok" and reducing Declan to 300 LP. Yuya winces in disappointment and he Sets a card, ending his turn in frustration, with means that the ATK of "Dark Rebellion" returns to normal.
 Declan comments that that was impressive, much to Yuya's surprise. Declan explains that he's seen what is beyond Yuya's Pendulum Summoning once again. He asks Yuya, if his Pendulum-Fusion Summoning came from his bonds with Zuzu Boyle, from who's bonds did that Pendulum-Xyz Summon come from? Yuya and Shay both gasp, remembering Yuto. Declan muses that he supposes that it doesn't matter; they'll find out soon enough. It's his turn next. 
 
       Declan  overlays " Oblivion King Abyss Ragnarok " and " Doom King Armageddon ".     
 Declan declares his turn and he draws " D/D/D Doom King Armageddon ". During his  Standby Phase , the Pendulum Effect of "Galilei" increases its Scale from 1 to 3, and then he uses the Scale 10 "Kepler" that was returned to his hand to re-Set the Pendulum Scales, allowing him to Summon monsters from Levels 4 to 9. He chants again, "Grand power which shakes my very soul! Arise within me and give birth to a new light that rends the darkness! Pendulum Summon! Revive! ((dub) "You may have uncovered the Pendulum technique, Yuya, but I have taken it further than you could have imagined by perfecting it! I Pendulum Summon!")" He Pendulum Summons "D/D/D Oblivion King Abyss Ragnarok" from his Extra Deck and "D/D/D Doom King Armageddon" from his hand. Gong recognizes "Armageddon", and explains to Aura that "Armageddon" cornered Yuya in his  last match  with Declan. Yuya activates a  Trap Card , " Wings of Misdirection ", which in addition to increasing the ATK of "Dark Rebellion Xyz Dragon" by 800 for the rest of the turn also negates the effects and the activation of cards currently on the field. The ATK of "Dark Rebellion" increases to 3300, which Aura observes is higher than that of "Armageddon", while Gong adds that he's sealed his opponent's Set cards. Declan thinks that from here he'll have Yuya cornered, and he overlays the Level 8 "Abyss Ragnarok" and "Armageddon". Shay, Gong and Aura are shocked, Gong and Aura voicing their surprise that Declan can also Pendulum-Xyz Summon, and Declan chants, "When two suns climb up into the sky, the grounds of a new world shall open up! Xyz Summon! Appear and come forth!  Rank 8 !  D/D/D Duo-Dawn King Kali Yuga ! (in the dub, he summons the monster without chanting)" Yuya is shocked at the monster's 3500 ATK. Declan explains that when "Kali Yuga" is Special Summoned, all other card effects are negated until the end of the turn. "Kali Yuga" waves its hand, greying out "Wings of Misdirection" and returning the ATK of "Dark Rebellion Xyz Dragon" to 2500. Aura laments that the ATK of "Dark Rebellion" has returned to normal. Declan declares his Battle Phase and "Kali Yuga" attacks "Dark Rebellion Xyz Dragon" with "Twin Break Shot ("Bolts of Banishment" in the dub)", destroying it and blasted Yuya down the stairs again, screaming as his LP falls to 800. He lands with a crash, and Declan walks up to the stairs. Gong and Aura race forwards, yelling Yuya's name. Declan ends his turn and asks if that is all Yuya has got. He wonders where Yuya's conviction to make him grovel went. Yuya begins struggling to get up, and Declan raises his voice, telling Yuya to come on, wasn't Yuya going to make Declan repent? 
 Gong and Aura can't bear to stand by and let this happen and run forwards to assist Yuya, but Yuya yells at them not to. He struggles up, stating that this is his Duel, his and Zuzu's and Yuto's. Shay runs up too, surprised to hear Yuya talking about Yuto. Yuya vows that he will save Zuzu no matter the cost, and Aura and Gong whisper Yuya's name sadly (the scene of Aura and Gong is cut from the dub). Yuya angrily adds he'll also keep his promise to Yuto. He remembers Yuto telling him to brings smiles with his Dueling, and Yuya screams that that's why he can't afford to lose! To those who would make them fight, and those that would hurt people through Dueling. There's no way that they'll lose to them. 
 Declaring his turn, Yuya draws in an arc. He vows that he'll win, he'll beat Declan with the card that Yuto entrusted to him, and he activates the  Spell Card  " Shuffle Reborn " since he controls no monsters, which revives "Dark Rebellion Xyz Dragon" from the Graveyard with its effects negated. Aura and Gong cheer the  Xyz Monster 's revival, and Yuya declares that the effect of "Shuffle Reborn" will then shuffle " Performapal Trump Witch " into his Deck and allow Yuya to draw another card. He draws " Xiangke Magician ", and thinks to himself that it's here. Yuya uses the Scale 3 "Xiangke Magician" to Set the Pendulum Scale, allowing him to Summon monsters from Levels 4 to  7 . He chants, "Swing, pendulum of the soul! Draw an arc of light across the aether! Pendulum Summon! Revive once more! Odd-Eyes Pendulum Dragon! ((Dub) "Swing far, pendulum! Carve the arc of victory! My monsters are ready to swing into action!")" "Odd-Eyes" appears again and roars. Yuya activates the effect of "Xiangke Magician", allowing him to grant an Xyz Monster a Level equal to its  Rank . "Xiangke Magician" infuses "Dark Rebellion Xyz Dragon" with energy, granting the Rank 4 "Dark Rebellion" a Level of 4, and both Celina and Shay are shocked, Shay voicing his surprise that an Xyz Monster can be granted a Level. Next Yuya activates the effect of "Xiangsheng Magician", making the Level of one monster equal to another. "Xiangsheng Magician" fires another arrow, covering "Dark Rebellion Xyz Dragon" in purple energy and "Odd-Eyes Pendulum Dragon" in red energy, making "Dark Rebellion" Level 7. Celina and Shay observe that Yuya now has two Level 7 monsters, and Declan smiles, commenting that it's here. Yuya overlays the Level 7 "Odd-Eyes Pendulum Dragon" and "Dark Rebellion Xyz Dragon", and he chants, "Dragon of dual-coloured eyes! Annihilate your enemies with your scale of wrath! Xyz Summon! Come forth!  Rank 7 ! Dragon with eyes of rage!  Odd-Eyes Rebellion Dragon ! ("If Declan wants me to throw my best at him, then this should certainly make him happy! I Xyz Summon Odd-Eyes Rebellion Dragon!" in the dub)" The Xyz-Pendulum Monster roars as it stands behind Yuya, and Shay gasps in awe as he watches with Celina.
 
         Declan  smiles after  Yuya  summons " Odd-Eyes Rebellion Dragon " praising it as the one card he truly was hoping to see.     
 None watch with more anticipation than Declan, who clenches his fist in pleasure, proclaiming to himself that this is it. He smiles, stating that this is what he wanted to see. Yuya activates the effect of "Wings of Misdirection" from his Graveyard, banishing it and both "Xiangke Magician" and "Xiangsheng Magician" to increase the ATK of "Odd-Eyes Rebellion Dragon" by 800 and to negate the activation and effects of all cards Declan controls. The ATK of "Odd-Eyes Rebellion Dragon" rises to 3800, but Declan reveals another effect of "Kali Yuga"; its effects cannot be negated by the effects of other cards. Yuya snaps that it doesn't matter even if Declan can do that, since the ATK of "Kali Yuga" is 3500 in comparison to the 3800 ATK of "Odd-Eyes Rebellion Dragon", and Declan's Set cards are sealed. He orders "Odd-Eyes Rebellion Dragon" to attack "Duo-Dawn King Kali Yuga" with "Sweeping Static Strike". Extending the energy blades from its wings, "Odd-Eyes Rebellion Dragon" dives forwards and plunges its tusks into the ground, tearing lines through the stairway as it spears towards "Kali Yuga". 
 
         " D/D/D Duo-Dawn King Kali Yuga " destroys " Odd-Eyes Rebellion Dragon ".     
 But Declan activates the effect of "Kali Yuga", detaching an Overlay Unit to destroy all Spell and Trap Cards on the field. "Kali Yuga" creates a gust of wind with a gesture, and Declan's two Set cards and both "Galilei" and "Kepler" explode, and Declan then activates the final effect of "Kali Yuga", detaching another Overlay Unit to return the destroyed cards to their original location. "Kali Yuga" raises its wings and the destroyed cards rematerialize. Declan explains that the effect of "Wings of Misdirection" only affects cards that were on the field when it was activated, so he can activate his cards now. He activates the  Continuous Trap Card  " Dark Contract with Errors ", allowing him to negate the effects of currently activated Trap Cards. The effect of "Wings of Misdirection" is negated and the ATK of "Odd-Eyes Rebellion Dragon" falls to 3000 as it continues to gouge its way through the stairs. Then Declan activates another Continuous Trap Card, "Dark Contract with Renewal", allowing him to copy the effect of an activated Trap Card. He activates the effect of "Wings of Misdirection", increasing the ATK of "Kali Yuga" to 4300 and the battle resumes. Declan tells "Kali Yuga" to beat "Odd-Eyes Rebellion Dragon" at its own game, and just as "Odd-Eyes Rebellion Dragon" gets within striking range, "Kali Yuga" unleashes a blast of dark energy, counterattacking and destroying "Odd-Eyes Rebellion Dragon". The shockwave blasts Yuya backwards again, and he screams as his LP falls to zero.
 
         Yuya  screams  Zuzu's  name in agony.     
 The devastated " Neo Heartland City " dissolves, and both Aura and Gong react with shock and sadness to Yuya's loss. Declan reminds Yuya that like he said, Yuya is naive. He can't save Zuzu Boyle as he is, but he still has great hopes for Yuya. He tells the rest of the Lancers who survived the Battle Royal, Celina, Gong, Shay,  Sylvio , Dennis, and Moon explaining that the same applies to them. Their knowledge of Pendulum Summoning have surpassed  LID 's current top team, which is why he's chosen them to become Lancers and cross dimensions with him. Gong asks, "Cross dimensions (in the dub, Gong notes it'll be a long trip)", and Declan nods. Declan turns and he walks away, contacting Claude and asking him if he recorded the data from the Duel. Claude confirms that he did, and Declan congratulates him. Yuya laments that he can't carry on like this, and he has to get stronger, stronger than he is now, in order to save Zuzu. With tears pouring down his face, Yuya screams Zuzu's name. 
 
 Featured Duel: Yuya Sakaki vs. Declan Akaba 
 Duel continues from the previous episode . 
 Turn 4: Declan 
 Declan  activates " D/D Savant Galilei " (   1) and " D/D Savant Kepler " (   10) in his  Pendulum Zones . Declan  Pendulum Summons  " D/D/D Oblivion King Abyss Ragnarok " (2200/3000) from his  hand  in  Attack Position . Since it was  Special Summoned , he activates its  effect , which allows him to Special Summon a " D/D/D "  monster  from his  Graveyard . He Special Summons " D/D/D Wave King Caesar " (2400/1200) in Attack Position. Declan  Normal Summons  " D/D Necro Slime " (300/300). He then activates the other effect of "Abyss Ragnarok", which allows him to  Tribute  1 other " D/D " monster he  controls  once per  turn  to  banish  a monster his opponent  controls . Declan Tributes "Necro Slime" and banishes " Rune-Eyes Pendulum Dragon ". Declan activates the effect of the "Necro Slime" in his Graveyard,  banishing  it from his Graveyard to  Fusion Summon  a "D/D/D"  Fusion Monster  from his  Extra Deck , using monsters from his side of the  field  as  Fusion Materials . Declan  fuses  "Abyss Ragnarok" and "Caesar" to Fusion Summon " D/D/D Wave Oblivion King Caesar Ragnarok " (3200/3000) in Attack Position. Since "Caesar" was  sent  from the field to the Graveyard, he activates its effect, allowing him to  add  a " Dark Contract " card from his Deck to his hand. Declan adds " Dark Contract with Renewal ". "Caesar Ragnarok"  attacks  and  destroys  " Beast-Eyes Pendulum Dragon " (Yuya: 2000 → 1800 LP). Declan  Sets  two cards.
 Turn 5: Yuya 
 Yuya  Pendulum Summons " Stargazer Magician " (1200/2400) and " Odd-Eyes Pendulum Dragon " (2500/2000) from his Extra Deck in Attack Position. He then Normal Summons " Performapal Pendulum Sorcerer " (1500/800). Yuya then activates the  Pendulum Effect  of " Xiangsheng Magician ", changing the Level of "Stargazer" to that of another monster he controls. He targets "Pendulum Sorcerer" ("Stargazer":   5 → 4). He then  overlays  his two Level 4 monsters to  Xyz Summon  " Dark Rebellion Xyz Dragon " (2500/2000) in Attack Position. He activates its effect,  detaching  an  Overlay Unit  to halve the  ATK  of a Level 5 or higher monster Declan controls ("Caesar Ragnarok" 3200 → 1600) and add that value to its own ATK ("Dark Rebellion" 2500 → 4100) until the  End Phase . Yuya activates the effect again, detaching another Overlay Unit to halve the ATK of "Caesar Ragnarok" again ("Caesar Ragnarok" 1600 → 800) and add that value to its own ATK ("Dark Rebellion" 4100 → 4900). "Dark Rebellion" attacks "Caesar Ragnarok", but Declan activates its effect, allowing him to  return  one other card he controls to his hand and then  equip  a monster Yuya controls to it, with "Caesar Ragnarok" gaining ATK equal to the equipped monster's ATK. Declan returns "Kepler" to his hand and then equips "Odd-Eyes" to "Caesar Ragnarok" ("Caesar Ragnarok" 800 → 3300). The attack of "Dark Rebellion" continues "Caesar Ragnarok" is destroyed (Declan: 1900 → 300 LP). Yuya Sets a card.
 Turn 6: Declan 
Declan  draws  " D/D/D Doom King Armageddon ". During the  Standby Phase , the Pendulum Effect of "Galilei" activates, increasing its  Pendulum Scale  by 2 ("Galilei":    1 → 3). He then activates "Kepler" (   10) in his left Pendulum Zone. Declan Pendulum Summons " D/D/D Oblivion King Abyss Ragnarok " (2200/3000) from his Extra Deck and "Doom King Armageddon" (3000/1000) from his hand in Attack Position. Since Yuya controls only one monster and no other cards in his  Spell & Trap Card Zones , he activates his  face-down  " Wings of Misdirection ", which allows him to increase the ATK of a monster he controls by 800, and  negate  the effects of all cards Declan controls until the  End Phase . Yuya targets "Dark Rebellion" for this effect ("Dark Rebellion" 2500 → 3300). Declan overlays his two Level 8 monsters to Xyz Summon " D/D/D Duo-Dawn King Kali Yuga " (3500/3000) in Attack Position. Since it was Special Summoned, its effect activates, negating the effects of all other face-up cards currently on the field except itself and any effects of cards played this turn, until the end of the turn. Thus, the effect of "Wings of Misdirection" is negated and the ATK of "Dark Rebellion" returns to normal ("Dark Rebellion" 3300 → 2500). "Kali Yuga" attacks and destroys "Dark Rebellion" (Yuya: 1800 → 800 LP).
 Turn 7: Yuya 
Yuya draws " Shuffle Reborn " and since he controls no monsters, he subsequently activates it, letting him Special Summon a monster from his Graveyard with its effects negated, draw a card and  shuffle  a card he controls into his Deck. At the End Phase, the drawn card and Summoned monster will be banished. He Special Summons "Dark Rebellion" (2500/2000) in Attack Position, returns " Performapal Trump Witch " to his Deck and draws " Xiangke Magician ". He then activates "Xiangke Magician" (   3) in his right Pendulum Zone. Yuya Pendulum Summons "Odd-Eyes" (2500/2000) from his Extra Deck in Attack Position. He then activates the Pendulum Effect of "Xiangke Magician", treating "Dark Rebellion" as having a Level equal to its  Rank  ("Dark Rebellion":   4 →   4). Yuya activates the Pendulum Effect of "Xiangsheng Magician", changing the Level of "Dark Rebellion" to that of another monster he controls. He targets "Odd-Eyes" ("Dark Rebellion":   4 → 7). Yuya overlays his two Level 7  Dragon - Type  monsters to Xyz Summon " Odd-Eyes Rebellion Dragon " (3000/2500). Yuya activates the effect of the "Wings of Misdirection" in his Graveyard, letting him banish it and two cards he controls to increase the ATK of a monster he controls by 800 and negate the effects of all cards his opponent controls. He banishes "Wings of Misdirection", "Xiangsheng Magician" and "Xiangke Magician" to increase the ATK of "Rebellion Dragon" (3000 → 3800). The effect of "Kali Yuga" prevents its own effects from being negated by any other cards. "Rebellion Dragon" attacks "Kali Yuga", but Declan activates the other effect of "Kali Yuga", detaching an Overlay Unit to destroy all Spell and Trap Cards on the field. He then detaches the other Overlay Unit to activate the other effect of "Kali Yuga", returning all Spell and Trap Cards destroyed from his side in this turn, back to the field. Because his Trap Cards have been destroyed and re-Set, they are not treated as having been on the field when "Wings of Misdirection" was activated, meaning he may activate them. Declan activates his face-down " Dark Contract with Errors ", which allows him to negate the effect of a Trap Card that was activated this turn, but he will take 1000  damage  during his next  Standby Phase . Thus, the effect of "Wings of Misdirection" is negated ("Rebellion Dragon" 3800 → 3000). As he negated the effect of an opponent's Trap Card with a card effect, Declan activates his face-down "Dark Contract with Renewal", letting him activate that negated card's effect for himself, but he will take 1000 damage during his next Standby Phase. Thus, the effect of "Wings of Misdirection" is activated and "Kali Yuga" gains 800 ATK ("Kali Yuga" 3500 → 4300). The attack of "Rebellion Dragon" continues and it is destroyed (Yuya: 800 → 0 LP).

 Mistakes
