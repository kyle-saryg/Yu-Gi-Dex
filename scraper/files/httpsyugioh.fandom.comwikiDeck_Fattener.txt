A " Deck Fattener " is the strategic opposite of a  Deck Thinner . Essentially, a Deck Fattener adds cards into the  Deck . Two examples of such cards are " Pot of Avarice " and " Pot of Generosity ". Another fattener is " Bait Doll " if you keep  targeting  a  face-down   Spell Card  you  control . Although a few Decks have benefited from Deck fattening, this strategy is usually looked down upon by  Duelists , as it adds more cards that they have to  draw  in order to get to what they need, thus slowing down their strategy. It is usually employed by Decks that need to recycle certain key cards or  mill  themselves dangerously, such as " Lightsworn ", " B.E.S. " and " Madolche ".
