 Summary 
 David Rabb  is perplexed by the presence of a second spirit card in  Chazz Princeton 's " Light and Darkness Dragon ", but finds it irrelevant, as he believes he'll soon own it and  Jaden Yuki 's " Winged Kuriboh " and " Elemental Hero Terra Firma ". Chazz speaks with Jaden, saying he doesn't care who wins the next match - Jaden or  Bastion Misawa . However, he urges Jaden to do his very best, knowing that Bastion is a tough opponent. Jaden starts to warn Chazz about David and the  Shadow Duels , but stops mid-way through. He then wonders whether Chazz is even aware of the fact that "Light and Darkness Dragon" has a  spirit , but ultimately decides that Chazz wouldn't believe him if he told him it did anyway. He tries to put the issue from his mind so he'll enjoy his duel with Bastion.
 Elsewhere, Bastion has eavesdropped on a conversation between  Zane Truesdale  and  Alexis Rhodes , and is jealous that Zane was the one to attempt to cheer her up after her loss to David. Bastion declares his intent to face Zane not only as a duelist but "as a man" as well. Zane tells him he'll have to win tournament, as that's the quickest path to dueling him. Though he'd like to crowned champion of the academy and Duel Zane, his primary wish to get revenge on Jaden for his earlier defeat. Jaden and Bastion meet at the Duel field to begin. Bastion goes first,  Normal Summoning  " Mezuki " in  Attack Position  and  Setting  a card. Bastion states he has measures prepared to deal with Jaden's tactics. Jaden  draws  " Polymerization ", commenting he just needs to draw " Elemental Hero Ocean ", as he has " Elemental Hero Woodsman " in his hand already. He Normal Summons "Woodsman" in  Defense Position  to end his turn.
 Seeing he has "Woodsman", but has not  Fusion Summoned  " Elemental Hero Terra Firma ", Bastion determined he hasn't drawn all the pieces. This is beneficial to Bastion as well, as he does not want to be forced into activation his  face-down  card too early, as it will negatively impact both players. Bastion  equips  "Mezuki" with " Saber of Malice ", which grants it the ability to destroy Defense Position monsters without  damage calculation . Knowing Jaden wanted to buy time with "Woodsman", Bastion attacks, and "Woodsman" is destroyed via the effect of "Saber of Malice". Jaden draws " Reinforcement of the Army " and knows he can Summon "Terra Firma" this turn. He plays " The Warrior Returning Alive ", letting him add the "Woodsman" in his  Graveyard  to his  hand . He then plays "Reinforcement of the Army" adding "Ocean" from his  Deck  to his hand. Jaden moves to activate "Polymerization", but Bastion activates his face-down " Narukami Waterfall ", which prevents both players from  sending  monsters in their hand to the Graveyard. Thus, Jaden cannot Fusion Summon, as "Ocean" would be sent from his hand to the Graveyard. Jaden Summons "Woodsman" in Defense Position and Sets a card. Zane is excited to see who will move on -  Ra Yellow 's prodigy or the possessor of the one-of-a-kind "Terra Firma".
 Bastion declares that step one was a success. He Summons " Onmoraki " and destroys "Woodsman" with the effect of "Saber of Malice" as "Mezuki" attacks. Jaden activates his face-down " Hero Signal ",  Special Summoning  "Ocean" from his hand. Bastion chooses to cancel his attack, and Sets two cards. He realizes that Jaden can still Fusion Summon, just not from his hand, but is confident his face-down cards will prevent it. Jaden activates " Hero's Return ", Special Summoning "Woodsman" from his Graveyard. It will be destroyed during the  End Phase , but Jaden's aim is to fuse from the  field . He once again moves to activate "Polymerization", but Bastion activates his face-down " Fires of Shiranui ", which prevents players from sending monsters on the field to the Graveyard unless it involves their being  destroyed . Despite this, Bastion can still Summon " Red Ogre " with the " Enma's Judgment " card he holds. Jaden destroys "Onmoraki" with "Ocean", putting one monster in Bastion's Graveyard. He'll need five more to Summon "Red Ogre". Bastion Summons " Gozuki " and activates his effect, sending an unspecified  Yokai  monster from his Deck to the Graveyard. "Gozuki" and "Mezuki" attack and destroy "Ocean" and "Woodsman", respectively.
