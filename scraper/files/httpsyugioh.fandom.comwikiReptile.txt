 Reptile  (Japanese:  爬 虫 類   Hachūrui ) is a  Type  of monster used by  Thelonious Viper ,  Misty Tredwell  and  Yuga Goha  in the anime, as well as  Seika Kohinata  and  Jim Crocodile Cook  in the manga.
 Reptile monsters were once one of the most overlooked and undersupported types, their only real use previously being  Tribute  fodder for " Ultra Evolution Pill ". However, with the release of the " Alien " and " Venom "  archetypes , Reptiles have come into their own as a  Type  that focuses on controlling the opponent with the use of  Counters .  Many Reptiles focus upon weakening the opponent instead of strengthening themselves, often leaving the opponent powerless.  Because of this, Reptile-based decks and archetypes focus on tactics that reward patience and strategy over simplicity and brute force. The most brutal example of this is found in " Vennominaga the Deity of Poisonous Snakes ", which, while difficult to get onto the field, brought near-invincibility as well as one of the game's few  Automatic Win  conditions.
 Later on, the " Reptilianne " archetype was introduced, taking a new spin on the control concept by replacing Counters with various effects that drop opposing monsters straight to 0 ATK, then using other effects to remove or even take control of those monsters.
 Reptile members of the " Worm " archetype were later added, this time focusing on flip effects which affect the enemies.
 Reptiles gain no boost from any  Field Spell Card ; however, Aliens do get a helping hand from " Otherworld - The "A" Zone " , while Venoms benefit from " Venom Swamp ". " Ogdoadic Origin " does support Reptiles while no boosting.
 Archetypes include " Alien ", " Venom ", " Worm ", " Reptilianne ", " Alligator ", " Evoltile " and " Ogdoadic ". These archetypes have given Reptiles representation in all Attributes.  WATER  and  EARTH  remain the most represented Attributes for Reptiles. 
 The strongest Reptile in terms of original ATK is " Ogdoabyss, the Ogdoadic Overlord ", at 3100 ATK. Other notable Reptiles are " Sinister Serpent ", " Reptilianne Vaskii ", " King of the Feral Imps ", " Evil Dragon Ananta ", " Cosmic Fortress Gol'Gar ", " Old Entity Hastorr ", " Vennominon the King of Poisonous Snakes ", " Vennominaga the Deity of Poisonous Snakes ", " Divine Serpent Geh " and " Earthbound Immortal Ccarayhua ".
