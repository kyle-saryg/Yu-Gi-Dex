 Description 
 The psychic Espa Roba channels the energies of the universe to read his opponent's hand during a Duel - or so he claims. Unfortunately,  Joey  debunked his cosmic powers as a hoax during Battle City. But what isn't fake are his Dueling skills, punishing Joey with his ace monster " Jinzo "

 Roaming Duelist (first event) 
 During his Duel with  Bella , he proclaimed that he was going to showcase his real non-psychic abilities, and that he is no longer the psychic Duelist. However, he felt himself using ESP, and questioned why as he didn't bring his brothers to Duel Links. He thought the universe must've gave him ESP just recently, and announced that he is now an actual psychic Duelist. Bella thought to herself that he should end his turn.
