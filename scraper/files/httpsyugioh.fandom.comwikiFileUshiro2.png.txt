 Appearance

       Ushiro with his eyes visible.     
 Toombs is an unassuming young boy with pale skin and long messy black hair that usually conceals his silver eyes. In comparison to his more flashily-dressed bandmates, Toombs dresses in simple clothes; a long sleeved shirt with a grey body and lighter grey sleeves that hang over his wrists, charcoal pants, and brown cowboy boots.
 
 Personality 
 Toombs is a troubled person with an identity crisis. Because his name literally means "behind you" along his low profile when compared to Roa and Romin, he struggles to have his existence properly noticed, much less his name remembered, as many people assume he is telling them to look behind them. He for the most part has a rather creepy demeanor, speaking quietly before going in louder rants for a rather terrifying contrast.
 Toombs is fond of urban legends, having his Deck full of monsters to represent them, and even goes as far as to explain them, which coupled with his unkempt appearance and vocal swings can lead to a rather frightful atmosphere. Beneath his spooky exterior, Ushiro is not truly malicious and seeks for people to acknowledge him. When Luke praised him and vowed to remember his name, he smiled genuinely for the first time, overjoyed at being acknowledged. He speaks and reacts more normally after Luke begins to surprise him during their Duel.
 
 Etymology 
 Ushiro's name when read in Japanese literally translates to "Behind You!" Due to this, he uses his name to spook people into looking behind them, though this has the unfortunate side effect of most people not knowing his name. [1]

 Deck 
 Toombs plays a  Zombie  Deck  centering around inflicting damage to his opponents. He focuses on the removal of cards his opponent's try to use from their hands, and dealing large amounts of damage due to the Rush Duel ruling to draw until holding 5 cards, and using his ace monster " Wicked Shadow - Dark Rooker " to remove his opponent's Spell/Traps, inflicting damage, and returning it to the hand for later use. For defense purposes Ushiro uses cards that change the battle position of his monsters, restricting his opponent to attack his monsters with the lowest level, and exchanging the ATK/DEF of "Dark Rooker".
 His cards are also based on urban legends of ghost mythology that include curses centering around death.
