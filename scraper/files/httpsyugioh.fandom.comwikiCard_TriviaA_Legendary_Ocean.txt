 Atlantis  (which was also an ancient setting in the " Waking the Dragons " arc) is the name of a legendary island first mentioned in  Plato 's dialogues  Timaeus  and  Critias . After a failed attempt to invade Athens, Atlantis sank into the  ocean  "in a single day and night of misfortune". 
 This area appears in the artworks of " Warrior of Atlantis ", " Poseidra, the Atlantean Dragon ", " Legendary Atlantean Tridon ", " Plate Salvage " and " Edict of Atlantis ". 
 This was the first card to manipulate a monster's Level. 
 This card is an upgraded form of " Umi ".
 " Lemuria, the Forgotten City " is also similar to this card in that it's also treated as "Umi" and affects WATER monster's Levels, but increases them instead.
