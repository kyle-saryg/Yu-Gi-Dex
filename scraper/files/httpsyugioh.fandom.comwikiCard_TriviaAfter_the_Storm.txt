 This card's artwork features " Speaker for the Ice Barriers " (the younger version of " Gishki Ariel "), as well as younger versions of " Gishki Avance ", " Gishki Emilia ", and " Winda, Priestess of Gusto " with " Revealer of the Ice Barrier " (the younger version of " Gishki Noellia ") hugging and soothing them. "Gishki Emilia" can be barely seen; she is behind Noellia's arm, as she hugs Noellia from behind.
 " Caam, Serenity of Gusto " and " Reeze, Whirlwind of Gusto " can also be seen hugging each other on the left side of the artwork. 
 In the background is the " Shrine of Mist Valley ". 
 The body of " Ancient Flamvell Deity " also appears behind the other characters. According to the official Duel Terminal story, he was defeated by " Trishula, Dragon of the Ice Barrier ". 
 The events of this card take place right after the war with the " Fabled " after the " Ice Barrier " tribe unleashed "Trishula, Dragon of the Ice Barrier" crushing the "Fabled" and ending the war with huge casualties.
 This card predates the formation of the " Gishki " tribe when " Gishki Noellia " was still "Revealer of the Ice Barrier". That is why there are no hostilities between "Noellia" and the " Gustos ". 
 This card's support for only two  Attributes  can be explained by the fact that the tribes of those two Attributes can be seen in this card's artwork. 
 "Winda" is the only  WIND  monster hugging "Noellia".
