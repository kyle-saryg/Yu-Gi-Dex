 Anime 
 Lazar plays a  " Jester " Court  Deck, in which he uses monsters that resemble court jesters, and  Trap Cards  that limit the moves his opponent can make. Most of his Trap Cards are  Continuous , which serves to limit the number of monsters Summoned to the field by his opponent while strengthening his key monster, " Jester Lord ". Several of his cards reference a royal court of justice, which correspond to his career as a top officer of public security. His cards appear in the  Ancient Prophecy  booster pack. Most of the cards in his Deck seem to also belong to the  Cup Ramen Man  in his  Duel Puzzles  at the arcade machine. This is probable seeing Lazar's love of Cup Ramen.
