       Eliphas  performing a Shining Draw.     
 Shining Draw  (シャイニング・ドロー  Shainingu Dorō ) is an ability native to the denizens of  Astral World  in the  Yu-Gi-Oh! ZEXAL  anime [1]  which allows a  Duelist  to  draw  any card they wish, to the point of sometimes creating a new card during a  Duel . [2]  More often than not, the " ZW - " monsters are the result of this draw. This ability can be utilized by  Yuma Tsukumo  and  Astral  when they merge their souls using  ZEXAL , but this can only be done outside of the  Human World , or in a location on Earth that mimics alternate dimensions.

 History 
 Astral  performed a Shining Draw to conclude his battle against  Don Thousand . [4]  In this way, he defeated Thousand, but lost most of his memories, which manifested in the form of fifty " Number " cards that scattered across the  Human World . [5] 
 
 Yu-Gi-Oh! ZEXAL 
       Yuma  and  Astral  performing a Shining Draw in  ZEXAL  form.     
 During  Astral 's Duel against  Kite Tenjo  within the  Emperor's Key ,  Yuma Tsukumo  was able to enter the key and merge with Astral via  ZEXAL . Their first Shining Draw resulted in " ZW - Unicorn Spear ", which enabled them to counter the  effects  of " Galaxy-Eyes Photon Dragon " and let " Number C39: Utopia Ray " safely  battle  it. However, Kite ended the Duel in a  draw  using " Photon Shock ". [2] 
 In the Duel against  Trey , " Final Prophecy " opened the gateway to the  Barian World . Here, Yuma and Astral combined with ZEXAL and used Shining Draw to draw " ZW - Phoenix Bow ", which countered the effects of " Number 6: Chronomaly Atlandis ". [6] 
 During the final match of the  World Duel Carnival  against  Vetrix , the  Sphere Field  enabled Yuma and Astral to combine with ZEXAL. Using the effect of " Seven Store ", they performed a "Triple Shining Draw". Here, they drew " ZW - Lightning Blade ", a "ZW -"  support  card called " ZEXAL Catapult " and a card that had previously existed, " Half Unbreak ". These were used to counter Vetrix's " Number 69: Heraldry Crest ", but Vetrix revealed another effect of that card, countering Yuma's move. [3]  Yuma proceeded to perform a "Final Shining Draw" on his next turn, this time bringing out " ZW - Tornado Bringer ". Even this card and "Lightning Blade" combined failed, as Vetrix used " Heraldry Burst " to  return  them to the  hand . "ZEXAL Catapult" and " Amarylease " enabled Yuma to Summon both cards again and he  overlaid  them to create " ZW - Leo Arms ", a "ZW -"  Xyz Monster . This monster allowed Yuma to perform a second  Battle Phase  and  negate  the effects of "Heraldry Crest", finally defeating Vetrix. After the Duel's conclusion, they remained in ZEXAL form and Yuma used "Lightning Blade" to anchor himself to the side of the Sphere Field in an attempt to rescue Vetrix when the the field moved to absorb both Duelists. [7] 
 During the Duel against  Vector  and  Dr. Faker , the power was utilized again after  Hart Tenjo  lowered the Sphere Field away from the  Sphere Field Cannon . Yuma drew " ZW - Ultimate Shield " and activated its first effect to return "Utopia Ray",  Shark 's " Number C32: Shark Drake Veiss " and Kite's " Neo Galaxy-Eyes Photon Dragon " back to the  field . He equipped "Ultimate Shield" to "Utopia Ray" and strengthened its  DEF  with " Xyz Unity " to transfer all three Xyz Monsters' DEF to the ATK of "Utopia Ray" and sending it to attack " Number 92: Heart-eartH Dragon ". The other effect of "Ultimate Shield" negated the effect of "Heart-eartH Dragon" that would inflict  effect damage , letting "Utopia Ray" destroy it and win the Duel. This released Dr. Faker from Vector's possession and temporarily ended the machination to destroy the  Astral World . [8] 
 
 Yu-Gi-Oh! ZEXAL II 
 After  Alito  revealed his true identity as one of the  Seven Barian Emperors , he Dueled  Yuma  within a  Barian Sphere Cube . Here, ZEXAL was enacted and Shining Draw was used to create " ZW - Eagle Claw ", which could negate the activation of Alito's many  Trap Cards , shattering Alito's defense and allowing Yuma to win the Duel. [9]

 Number 96 's collaboration with  Vector  resulted in him gaining  Chaos  and causing a dimensional rift that began to destroy  Earth , the  Astral World  and the  Barian World . Number 96 used " Chaos Field " to take " Number 69: Heraldry Crest " and " Number 92: Heart-eartH Dragon " from Yuma and perform  Rank-Ups  on them, resulting in " Number C69: Heraldry Crest of Horror " and " Number C92: Heart-eartH Chaos Dragon ". [10]  Using " Xyz Treasure ", Yuma drew four cards via Shining Draw - " Utopian Hope ", " Overtake Summon ", " ZW - Asura Strike " and " ZW - Sleipnir Mail ". This combination enabled Yuma to destroy " Number Lockdown " and prevent "Chaos Field" from being used again before defeating Number 96. However, Number 96's subsequent strike grievously injured Astral, who was forced to return to the Astral World to heal. [11] 
 
         As  Astral's  missing half,  Yuma  utilizes the power to perform a Shining Draw.     
 Yuma journeyed to the Astral World in an attempt to retrieve Astral. He was confronted by  Eliphas , the embodiment of the Astral World's desires. [1]  Eliphas demonstrated the ability to perform Shining Draw  at will , using the ability to build a combination on his field that allowed him to continually  Rank-Up  his " New Order " monsters and make them extremely difficult to defeat in battle, as well as give him more opportunities to draw cards, and thus perform more Shining Draws. [12]  However, Yuma being Astral's missing half gained the ability to perform a Shining Draw on his own. Disgusted by Eliphas' assertions that the Astral World must continually Rank-Up to better itself, Yuma created " Rank-Down-Magic Numeron Fall ", which let him  Rank-Down  "Utopia" into " Number 39: Utopia Roots ". This  Rank  1 monster was able to use the effects of " New Order 13: Etheric Amon " and its overwhelming amount of Overlay Units against Eliphas and win Yuma the Duel. [13] 
 Vector and  Don Thousand 's machinations resulted in the  Human  and Barian Worlds beginning to merge. [14]  Yuma and Astral returned to confront  Mr. Heartland  after  Kite Tenjo  was unable to continue the Duel against him. Here, they used Shining Draw to create " ZS - Vanish Sage ", which they combined with Kite's " Galaxy-Eyes Photon Dragon " to destroy Heartland's " Infection Bug Tokens " and win the Duel. [15] 
 
         Chaos Draw  and Shining Draw.     
 During the final Duel against Don Thousand in cooperation with  Nash , Yuma and Astral utilized this power multiple times. First, they drew " Re-Xyz ", enabling them to  Xyz Summon  " Number 39: Utopia " from their  Graveyard . Then, via " Xyz Treasure ", they performed three more Shining Draws, amongst the draws was " ZS - Ouroboros Sage ", which he combined with " Number C39: Utopia Ray Victory " and Nash's " Number 101: Silent Honor ARK ". This nearly defeated Thousand's " Number C1000: Numeronius ", but a previously unseen effect of that card enabled Thousand to survive. Using " Session Draw ", Yuma and Nash were both able to draw a card during their next  Draw Phase . Yuma used Shining Draw to draw " ZW - Tornado Bringer ", prompting Nash to use  Chaos Draw  to draw " Panther Shark ". This let them overlay their monsters via "Session Draw" and Summon " Number 73: Abyss Splash ". [5]  Between "Utopia", "Abyss Splash" and " Number 100: Numeron Dragon ", Yuma and Nash were able to defeat " Number iC1000: Numeronius Numeronia " after using " Bonds of Hope ", " Utopia Rising "  and " Double or Nothing! " to augment their monsters' powers. [16] 
 During their final rematch with Nash, Yuma and Astral used Shining Draw, to draw an unspecified card, which had to have been " Rank-Up-Magic Astral Force :, though process of elimination. [17]  Later, he used it again to draw " ZW - Sylphid Wing ", which would have let "Utopia" safely battle " CXyz Barian Hope ". Due to Nash's " Draw of Fate ", one more Shining Draw was used, this time to draw "Double or Nothing!". [18] 
 In the ceremonial Duel between Yuma and Astral, both players performed Shining Draws. Yuma drew " Halfway to Forever ", letting him end a battle and Xyz Summon from his Graveyard, creating " Number F0: Utopia Future ". Via this move, Astral determined that Yuma was the other half that was lost during his engagement against Don Thousand eons ago. Astral himself performed a Shining Draw (referred to as a "Cosmic Shining Draw" in the dub) to draw " Hyper-Rank-Up-Magic Ultimate Force ", which he used to Summon " Number 99: Utopic Dragon ". [19] 
 There have also been three one-off variants of Shining Draw (one of which was only named so in the dub):
 
 Dark Draw 
         Astral  in  Dark ZEXAL  form, performing a Dark Draw.     
 Dark Draw  (ダーク・ドロー  Dāku Dorō ) is a malevolent counterpart of Shining Draw, used only once by  Dark ZEXAL  during a Duel against  Vector . Compared to the " ZW - "  monsters  that regular Shining Draws frequently create, Dark Draw was used to create a "DZW -" monster, " Chimera Clad ". In the Duel, it was  equipped  to " Number C39: Utopia Ray V ", granting it the ability to prevent itself from being  destroyed by battle , as well as doubling its  ATK  and allowing it to  attack  again. [20] 
 
 Destiny Shining Draw 
         ZEXAL III performing a Destiny Shining Draw.     
 During Yuma and  Nash 's Duel against  Don Thousand , Yuma in  ZEXAL III  form once performed a  Destiny Shining Draw  using the effect of " Session Draw ". No particular differences are visible between this and a regular Shining Draw, however, except that it was used to draw a card that had previously be drawn with Shining Draw - " ZW - Tornado Bringer ".
 
 Cosmic Shining Draw 
         Astral 's Cosmic Shining Draw.     
 During the Ceremonial Duel, Astral performed what was called a  Cosmic Shining Draw  to create " Hyper-Rank-Up-Magic Ultimate Force ". This name was only used in the dub; the Japanese version retains the regular Shining Draw name.
 
 
 Trivia 
 The effect of " Creator of Hope " may be a reference to Shining Draw. 
 The concept of Shining Draw is most likely derived from the fact that other  Yu-Gi-Oh!  protagonists have a tendency to pull exactly the card they needs from their  Decks  in desperate situations. It may also be a reference to the  Destiny Draw  system from the  Tag Force  series of video games, where the card on top of the Deck is similarly shown glowing.
