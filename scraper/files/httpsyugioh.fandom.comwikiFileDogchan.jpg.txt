 Biography 
 Yu-Gi-Oh! ZEXAL 
 World Duel Carnival Preliminaries 
 After a dog commanded by Pip steals  Yuma 's  Heart Pieces ,  Cathy  sends her army of cats to search for the dog. After Cathy found out, she went to the location and was threatened by a pack of dogs, to which her cat army soon appeared to defend her. The leader of the pack of dogs, Pip, posing as  Roscoe , appeared before Cathy and challenged her, which shocked her and the rest of her friends as the dog could not only talk, but Duel. As the Duel progressed, Pip managed to get an overwhelming advantage, but a direct  attack  from Cathy's " Cat Girl Magician " managed to damage a device on the back of the dog, which revealed to the rest that the one Cathy is Dueling against was actually a little girl, who was the real Pip. She revealed to Cathy that she was too nervous to Duel face-to-face therefore used her dog as her front. After Cathy and her friends spoke to Pip, she managed to muster up enough confidence to carry on the Duel on her own, even managing to win. After the Duel, Pip gave Yuma the stolen Heart Piece back, but was rewarded by Cathy with her own Heart Pieces. [1]  However, as she was not one of the finalists, she apparently later lost or was not able to collect enough Heart Pieces.
 
 World Duel Carnival Finals 
       Pip watches the finals of the WDC.     Pip is next seen sitting next to  Cameron Clix  (one row down from  Cody Callus ) among the spectators watching Yuma's Duel with  Vetrix  in the final round of the finals. [2]
