 Monster Fighter  is a two-player handheld battle game from the  manga .
 Each player's setup consists of three parts; A posable monster figure, a "fighting gun" and a barcode disk. There are 100 different monsters, with varying abilities. The monster is mounted onto the gun and connected to the base with a remote control wire.
