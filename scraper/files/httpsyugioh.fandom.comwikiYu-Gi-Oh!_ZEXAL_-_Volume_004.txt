 Message from Kazuki Takahashi 
 "ZEXAL" has a lot of female characters, and the way Mr. Miyoshi draws them is especially cute and awesome! [2] 
 
 Message from Shin Yoshida 
 The manga is different from the anime, and thinking up all the duels by myself makes my head explode. But as long as everyone is having fun, I'm gonna jet! [2] 
 
 Message from Naohito Miyoshi 
 Luna and Yagumo are original manga characters! What? They kinda look like someone? Hah hah hah… Yeah, maybe, so. [2]
