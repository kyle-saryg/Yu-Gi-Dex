 The  Dueling Arena  is a type of dueling device developed by KaibaCorp, which consists of two modified podiums for each player to use over the course of the  Duelist Kingdom  tournament. Each podium has a play field that can project giant holographic images of the cards the player  activates  or  summons . Some arenas also contained properties of specific type(s) of land masses that could change a  monster 's  ATK  and  DEF  depending on what terrain was favored by what monster (see  Field Power Bonus ). According to Kaiba's schematics of Duelist Kingdom, there are ten Dueling Arenas spread throughout the island, including within Pegasus' Castle. Certain variants of the  Duel Arenas  were also seen in the  KaibaCorp  building,  KaibaLand  and in  Duke Devlin 's gameshop.
 KaibaCorp  also has their later product known as the  Duel Disks , which the duelist could plug into the arenas with a retractable cable using the Arena's holographic display instead of the  Duel Disk 's.
 In the manga, a different device is used in  Duelist Kingdom  called a  Battle Box . It was a smaller and more realistic in terms of real-world technology version of the  Dueling Arenas . These devices were invented by Kaiba Corp. and would later be replaced by another of their inventions in Battle City, the Duel Disk.
