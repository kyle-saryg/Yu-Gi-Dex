 Biography 
 Eager to win a trip to Australia in an upcoming tournament,  Jonouchi  trained Joe hard. He continued to train him during school hours, rather than turn the Digital Pet off. [1] 
 Jonouchi connected Joe with  Yugi Mutou 's pet  U2  for a data exchange. As Digital Pets commonly took after their owners, Joe began to bully U2, like how Jonouchi used to bully Yugi. The two pets became friends afterwards, similar to Jonouchi and Yugi. [1] 
 After  Kujirada  got his pet,  Devil Master , to eat  Anzu Mazaki 's pet,  Sumomo-chan , Jonouchi connected Joe to Devil Master to battle. Joe initially caught Devil Master with a sneak attack, but was ultimately eaten too.  Hiroto Honda  avenged the two of them by having  Super Strawberry  beat Devil Master. [1] 
 U2 was able to beat  Haiyama 's  pet , after powering-up due to its data exchange with Joe. [1]
