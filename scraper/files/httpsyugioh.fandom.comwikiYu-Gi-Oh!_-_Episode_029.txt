 Summary 
 The first  Duel  of the  Duelist Kingdom  finals between  Mai Valentine  and  Yugi Muto  begins. This time, Mai is playing without cheating. The Duel does not start off very well for Yugi, as Mai's " Mirror Wall " cuts all of Yugi's attacking  monsters '  ATK  in half, making them easy pickings for Mai's powered-up " Harpie Lady ". Mai's " Shadow of Eyes " prevents him from playing any of his monsters in  Defense Position , and her " Harpie's Feather Duster " destroys two of Yugi's strongest  Trap Cards , " Spellbinding Circle " and " Mirror Force ". To make things worse, Yugi and  Yami Yugi  continue to internally clash for control of the Duel, as Yugi will not let Yami Yugi Duel, for fear that he might recklessly hurt someone as he  almost did when Kaiba threatened to kill himself if Yugi won . With only 300  Life Points  left, can Yugi get over his fear and make a come-from-behind victory, or will he be eliminated and lose his chance to save his  grandfather  and the Kaiba brothers?
 
 Featured Duel: Yami Yugi vs. Mai Valentine 
 
 This Duel uses  Duelist Kingdom  gameplay. Rules and  card effects  may differ from that of the  TCG / OCG . See the individual card articles for more information.     
 Turn 1: Mai 
 Mai   draws . She then  Normal Summons  " Harpie Lady " (1300/1400) in  Attack Position  and  Sets  a card.
 Turn 2: Yami Yugi 
 Yugi  draws " Gaia The Fierce Knight " and subsequently Normal Summons it (2300/2100) in Attack Position. "Gaia"  attacks  "Harpie Lady", but Mai  activates  her face-down " Mirror Wall " to  negate  the attack and halve the  ATK  of "Gaia The Fierce Knight" ("Gaia The Fierce Knight": 2300 → 1150/2100).
 Turn 3: Mai 
Mai draws " Cyber Shield " and subsequently activates it,  equipping  it to "Harpie Lady" and increasing its ATK and  DEF  by 500 ("Harpie Lady": 1300 → 1800/1400 → 1900). "Harpie Lady" attacks and  destroys  "Gaia The Fierce Knight" (Yugi: 2000 → 1350  LP ).
 Turn 4: Yami Yugi 
Yugi draws " Summoned Skull " and subsequently Normal Summons it (2500/1200) in Attack Position. "Summoned Skull" attacks "Harpie Lady", but Yugi forgot that "Mirror Wall" is a  Continuous Trap Card . The  effect  of "Mirror Wall" then activates, which negates the attack ("Summoned Skull": 2500 → 1250/1200). Yugi Sets a card.
 Turn 5: Mai 
Mai draws. She then activates "Harpie's Feather Duster" to destroy Yugi's Set " Spellbinding Circle ".
 Turn 6: Yami Yugi 
Yugi  switches  "Summoned Skull" to  Defense Position  and Normal Summons " Feral Imp " (1300/1400) in Defense Position.
 Turn 7: Mai 
Mai draws " Rose Whip " and subsequently activates it, equipping it to "Harpie Lady" and increasing its ATK and DEF by 300 ("Harpie Lady": 1800 → 2100/1900 → 2200). "Harpie Lady" attacks and destroys "Feral Imp".
 Turn 8: Yami Yugi 
Yugi draws. He then passes his turn.
 Turn 9: Mai 
Mai draws " Harpie's Pet Dragon " and subsequently Normal Summons it (2000/2500) in Attack Position. Due to its effect, "Harpie's Pet Dragon" gains 300 ATK and DEF for each "Harpie Lady" on the field, and there is currently one ("Harpie's Pet Dragon": 2000 → 2300/2500 → 2800). "Harpie's Pet Dragon" attacks and destroys "Summoned Skull".
 Turn 10: Yami Yugi 
Yugi draws " Dark Magician " and subsequently Normal Summons it (2500/2100) in Defense Position. He then Sets a card.
 Turn 11: Mai 
Mai draws " Shadow of Eyes " and subsequently activates it. Now all male monsters that Yugi controls that are in Defense Position are switched to Attack Position. Any monsters that have been affected by this effect must attack the turn they have been switched to Attack Position. "Dark Magician" is switched to Attack Position and is forced to attack "Harpie Lady". The effect of "Mirror Wall" then activates, negating the attack ("Dark Magician": 2500 → 1250/2100). Mai then activates another "Harpie's Feather Duster" to destroy Yugi's Set " Mirror Force ". "Harpie's Pet Dragon" attacks and destroys "Dark Magician" (Yugi: 1350 → 300 LP).
 Duel continues in the next episode . 
 
 Differences in adaptations 
 The dub shows "Yugi" dueling poorly because he is distracted by keeping the spirit of the Puzzle in check. The Japanese version does not say this because it has never shown Yugi's and Atem's minds to be fused. Instead, Atem's spirit is the only one Dueling, but he is thinking about defeating Pegasus and not paying proper attention to Mai.
 Similarly, the dub includes Atem asking multiple times for Yugi to accept his help, with Yugi refusing. The Japanese version does not have this exchange. 
 The artwork and appearance of " Harpie Lady " was edited so it was less revealing. 
 The spikes on the breastplate of " Cyber Shield " are removed. 
 Errors 
 When  Yugi   Summons  his " Summoned Skull ", in both the Japanese and US adaptations, "Summoned Skull's" DEF are 2300 and not 1200, as in the other episodes. 
 In both versions, when Yugi draws "Summoned Skull", on the display of  Mai 's cards on the field you can see " Rose Whip " on it next to " Cyber Shield " when she hasn't played it yet. 
 When "Rose Whip" is equipped, "Harpie Lady's" ATK gains the 300 points starting from 2100 instead of ending at it. The correct number is displayed afterwards.
