 Summary 
 The final  Duel  of  Duelist Kingdom  is about to begin.  Yugi Muto  will face  Maximillion Pegasus  for the release of  his grandpa ,  Kaiba  and  Mokuba .  The Big Five  are watching the Duel, knowing that if Pegasus wins,  KaibaCorp  is his.
 The Duel does not start off very well for Yugi, as Pegasus is able to read Yugi's mind through the use of his  Millennium Eye , thereby countering any of Yugi's moves. 
 Meanwhile,  Tristan , believing Pegasus is up to something, runs off to the castle's dungeon to find the Kaiba brothers. He wanders around the dungeon until he finds Mokuba. Unfortunately, unlocking his cell door triggered a silent alarm, forcing him to flee while the guards hunt him down.

 Differences in adaptations 
 When  Pegasus  holds up his " Soul Prison " cards,  Yugi 's Grandfather's soul card is added in the dub. 
 In the dub, a padlock is put in place instead of a graphic reading LOCK OFF on the screen when  Tristan  breaks into  Mokuba 's cell. 
 " Red Archery Girl " is given more clothing to wear in the dub. 
 The guard guarding  Mokuba Kaiba 's cell had a gun in his hand in the original. The gun is removed in the dub. 
 Mistakes 
 In both versions, when  Pegasus  Summons " Ryu-Ran ", it is shown in Attack Position on his Duel screen.
