 Biography 
 Aaron was Alister's best friend growing up. [1] 
 Seto Kaiba  encountered him and two other boys when Alister showed Kaiba a vision of his past using the power of the  Orichalcos . Kaiba decided to go outside his hiding place with the boy and plays  chess  with him. [1] 
 Aaron is later killed in an explosion by a group of  KaibaCorp  tanks. (In the dub, he sees an explosion has happened near where the other boys were and tries to go to them, but Kaiba holds him back, saying it's too dangerous. Aaron keeps pleading, but when Aaron looks back at Kaiba, Kaiba sees his own brother, Mokuba, pleading with him; suddenly, tanks come and Alister appears and Aaron disappears.) [1]
