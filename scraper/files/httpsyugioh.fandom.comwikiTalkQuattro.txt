 Deck 
 Shouldn't the gravekeeper be his past deck? he might have change his deck since then. maybe we wait for the episodes to air to decide? - 164.78.248.244  ( talk ) 01:18, October 12, 2011 (UTC)
 
 Yeah, we don't know yet. If he still uses Gravekeeper's later, we'll keep the same Decklist. If he uses something else, the Decks will be separated.  Cheesedude  ( talk  •  contribs ) 01:26, October 12, 2011 (UTC) 
 You know what's funny? I have a Gravekeeper's Deck that is like his! (But doesn't have Mirror Force, or that unknown spell).  Bopdog111  ( talk  •  contribs ) 01:20, March 14, 2017 (UTC) 
 Record 
 This  was featured in the today's episode. Should we list his victories in those tournaments? And if yes, what deck should they belong to? --  The Goblin   Talk    02:30, November 29, 2011 (UTC)
 
 Yeah, I think we should list them. Reminds of the information on Z-one's analysis of Yusei. It would be best to put in another section entirely, actually. Or maybe just list it in the prose as part of the History section.  Cheesedude  ( talk  •  contribs ) 04:01, November 29, 2011 (UTC) 
 I'd go with his past deck. --  The Goblin   Talk    14:28, November 29, 2011 (UTC) 
 Accomplishments 
 Nationals weren't included in the list from episode 33.  [1]  That's why it shouldn't be put with a bullet which indicates that it appeared on that list. -- 109.93.92.203  ( talk ) 01:50, December 19, 2011 (UTC)
 I changed the header so it says "Accomplishments in both the present and past", so that way anyone who reads it won't get confused.  Shardsilver  ( talk  •  contribs ) 01:52, December 19, 2011 (UTC)
 
 It was fine the way it was. It was specifically referenced as being in a different episode. It's a list of accomplishments, not a list of accomplishments that appeared in one particular episode. The article is sufficiently referenced that it shouldn't be confusing.  Cheesedude  ( talk  •  contribs ) 01:54, December 19, 2011 (UTC) 
 I agree with you, I only did it so he wouldn't be confused (I did point out the reference thing in my summery).  Shardsilver  ( talk  •  contribs ) 01:57, December 19, 2011 (UTC)
 I don't get a damn thing what you are trying to say nor I'm willing to understand. -_- Anyway, I'd suggest this simple form:
 
==Accomplishments==
IV is known to have won the following tournaments:
* The [[National Duel Circuit]]<ref name="ep12"/><ref name="ep26"/>
* Asia Duelist Championship (9 wins, 0 losses, and 4892.9 points)<ref name="ep33" />
* Mini Surf Expert Match (5 wins, 0 losses, and 573.4 points)<ref name="ep33" />
* T.F.E. Tournament (6 wins, 0 losses, and 949.1 points)<ref name="ep33" />

 Cheese moved it down by one, so no worrys.  Shardsilver  ( talk  •  contribs ) 02:22, December 19, 2011 (UTC)
 
 What does this mean? 
 What does 'The number of "Gimmick Puppet" is a play on IV's own name is the Roman "4".' mean?  86.15.144.198  ( talk ) 21:08, December 24, 2011 (UTC)
 
 no quartte   used that card. with shark.in the tourametnt . by ainme know. 17:23, April 15, 2013 (UTC) Ainme know  ( talk  •  contribs )
 
 
 Numbers 
 Check out this screenshot I found:
 http://oi44.tinypic.com/25k5u74.jpg 
That are the cards Iv threw to choose his targets. Later, V takes one of them and gives it to III - it was Number 32. And as we can see, the cards are Xyz monsters. So, well, this is most like speculation, but probably all of them are Numbers, what mean Tron's family possess at least 10 Number cards, right?  LegenaryAsariUgetsu  ( talk  •  contribs ) January 4th, 2012, 0:26 (UTC)
 no this card is not number 32 but an unidentified number.  Epyon333  ( talk  •  contribs ) 09:16, September 27, 2013 (UTC)
 
 See  this discussion . -- 93.86.54.138  ( talk ) 01:19, January 4, 2012 (UTC) 
 Another Number he owns? 
 http://blog-imgs-47.fc2.com/s/u/n/sunetto/Sin-No4flags.jpg 
 If you look at the big figure behind IV carefully, it does not look like Giant Killer at all, its got a sword/staff, and it seems to be sitting on a throne unlike Giant killer...  —This unsigned comment was made by  Timelordgabrion  ( talk  •  contribs ) 06:20, April 18, 2012 
 
 Correctly, it's not No. 15. We don't know if it is a "Number" or not. --  The Goblin   I'm feelin' the flow    02:31, May 4, 2012 (UTC) 
 Collected Numbers 
 Should we also list the Numbers his father and brothers possess(ed)? --  The Goblin   I'm feelin' the flow    08:05, June 7, 2012 (UTC)
 
 We don't actually know if IV collected them all himself or not. Though V and Tron were said not to be Hunters and III was also implied to not be one, that doesn't mean they couldn't have obtained them in other ways.  Cheesedude  ( talk  •  contribs ) 16:31, June 7, 2012 (UTC) 
 Dub name spelling 
 Is it spelled as Quatro or Quattro? They almost sound the same.-- Power32840  ( talk  •  contribs ) 19:00, October 12, 2012 (UTC)
 
 That's true, the phrase is wrong. Gonna fix it.  User:LegendaryAsariUgetsu  December 24th, 2011, 19:10 (UTC) 
 
quarrte is spleed that way in the show. of yugioh zeaxal 3rd season. ( Anime know ) my user nAme. 17:19, April 15, 2013 (UTC) Ainme know  ( talk  •  contribs ) 17:19, April 15, 2013 (UTC)
 
 
 [2] . The name is indeed Quattro. I also got a picture of his name in episode 26.  WinterNightmare  ( talk  •  contribs ) 19:34, October 12, 2012 (UTC) 
 Okay-- Power32840  ( talk  •  contribs ) 11:37, October 13, 2012 (UTC) 
 On the topic of dub name spellings. Any idea approximately when we should be able to confirm the spelling of the other two brothers? 
 - Falzar FZ - ( talk page | useful stuff )  12:34, October 13, 2012 (UTC) 
 Have no idea. We will leave Cinco the same since there is no other spellings for him.-- Power32840  ( talk  •  contribs ) 13:36, October 13, 2012 (UTC) 
 Just realized, the names are Trey, Quattro, and Quinton.-- Power32840  ( talk  •  contribs ) 11:55, October 28, 2012 (UTC) 
 Real name 
 As this is his real name it takes precedence over his dub ALIAS. Hence don't change it back.  —This unsigned comment was made by  Super side swiper  ( talk  •  contribs ) 15:21, October 21, 2012‎ 
 
 
 God Reference? 
 Because of his yellow-ish clothes (and hair) and the fact that he is the middle child, could one say that there is a reference to  The Winged Dragon of Ra  and by extension the  Ra Yellow  dorm? -- Rocket.knight.777  ( talk  •  contribs ) 01:21, December 16, 2012 (UTC)
 
 No, that's just ridiculous.  31.11.101.253  ( talk ) 18:52, April 15, 2013 (UTC) 
 It can be coincidence or Writer had a thought of that - IV went with Red and was base on Osiris Red (I hated Dub name so much) while V had blue color and would be at top of anything, which went with Obelisk Blue. But still, that's not required to include that in the articles reckless your argument started or not. -- i F r e d C a t  20:40, April 15, 2013 (UTC)
