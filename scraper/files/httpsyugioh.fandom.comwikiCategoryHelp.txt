 About this category 
 This category is intended to contain all the  local  "help" pages for this Wikia: pages that can help contributors and/or readers. If you find helpful pages that you think should be here, you may include them here just by typing [[Category:Help]] on them.
 Most, but not all, have "Help:" at the beginning of their page names and are therefore in the "Help" namespace; an automatically-generated list of those can be found at  Special:AllPages  by running down the "Namespace" menu.
