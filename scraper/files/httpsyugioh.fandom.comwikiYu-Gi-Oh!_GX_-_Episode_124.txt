 Summary 
 The gym is the final place within  Duel Academy  still safe from the  Duel Ghouls . As such, the remaining students begin piling furniture by all the entrances, and nailing together wooden barricades to block the doors.  Axel Brodie  recruits a small group of  Obelisk Blue  students that he calls the " Blue Berets " which he intends to use as a military-style unit to help defend the students.
 Marcel Bonaparte , still with the  Devil Arm  in place of his own and possessed by  the demon , comments that his  Duel Ghouls  have been quite effective as he sits in the library and mulls over his plan. (In the Japanese version, he calls the organization the " Martin Empire ", as his name in that version is Martin Kanou.) The students start arguing and fighting over the little food they have remaining, as the food storage facility was seized by the Duel Ghouls. One student named  Slate  (Harada in the Japanese version), after being scolded for fighting with others by Jaden and  Jesse Anderson , leads two other unnamed students ( Teraoka  and  Yamanaka  in the Japanese version) out of the gym in an attempt to find food elsewhere in the building. They end up in the library after being chased by the Duel Ghouls.
 Marcel offers them food, and also offers them positions of power in his organization. He lures them into a " Polymerization " card, which fuses them with three monster spirits, and they become the  Three Masked Knights . Marcel makes an announcement to the remaining students - he is willing to give them access to the food storage facility in exchange for being allowed to take over the power supply station outside, which has broken down due to the sand. He specifically asks  Jaden Yuki , but  Jim Crocodile Cook  advises him not to take the deal, as they may still be able to fix the station. Jaden refuses the deal, which enrages the remaining students. However, Jaden counters by asking if Marcel would be willing to bet access to both on a Duel. Marcel agrees and states that their opponents are already outside. After deciding it's too risky for Jaden to Duel as he is still damaged from his Duel with  Ms. Fontaine , Jesse offers to take all three on himself, but instead Jim and  Axel Brodie  decide they will Duel also.
 The Duels begin, and Jesse gains an early lead on his opponent, after the Knight passes his first turn. Axel and Jim both end up taking over 1000 damage before their own first turns come.
