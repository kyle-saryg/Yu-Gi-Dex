 Previously Official Rulings 
   These TCG rulings were issued by  Upper Deck Entertainment  and have since been deemed unofficial by Konami. [2]  They were previously considered official and can still be correct, as long as they follow the official gameplay rules, or unless Konami has issued a ruling that says otherwise. References:  [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] 
 
 " Adhesion Trap Hole " works against "a monster or monsters", so " Adhesion Trap Hole " does NOT target. 
 When " Cyber Jar " is activated, you may use " Adhesion Trap Hole " against all monsters your opponent  Special Summons  in  face-up   Attack Position , but " Adhesion Trap Hole " has no effect on any monsters your opponent Special Summons  face-down . 
 " Adhesion Trap Hole " cannot affect monsters Special Summoned  face-down  with " The Shallow Grave ", " Morphing Jar #2 ", etc. 
 If a monster affected by " Adhesion Trap Hole " is  flipped  face-down (with " Book of Moon ", etc.), " Adhesion Trap Hole "'s effect disappears and the monster's  ATK  is back to normal. 
 " Adhesion Trap Hole " halves the original ATK, so if you  activate  another effect that alters ATK, halve the original ATK first and then  resolve  the other ATK-modifying  effect . 
 If a monster affected by " Adhesion Trap Hole " is then equipped with " Megamorph ", only " Megamorph "'s effect applies.
