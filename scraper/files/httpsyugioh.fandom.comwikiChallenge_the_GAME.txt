 Lyrics (TV Size) 
 Kanji Rōmaji English 
 
 今　過去　未来も  
僕等が　願っている　夢の欠片  
掴み取るまで  
Ｃｈａｌｌｅｎｇｅ ｔｈｅ Ｇａｍｅ 
 
打ち壊せないくらいの問題が  
僕等を　また　試している  
君が胸に　抱き続ける　心  
信じ抜いて　それが力になる 
 
涙を流して　挫けそうでも  
絆で明日を　繋いでいこう！  
 
全て壊すんだ 
恐れも　運命さえ　熱い夢を  
燃やし続け　突き抜ける 
 
今　過去　未来も  
僕等が　願っている　夢の欠片  
手を伸ばし行こう  
限界超えて  
掴み取るまで  
Ｃｈａｌｌｅｎｇｅ ｔｈｅ Ｇａｍｅ

 In the present, past and future.  
We are wishing upon the shards of dreams.  
Until we can grab hold of them.  
Challenge the GAME. 
 
Let it Go.  
 
When there's a problem that can't be beaten.  
We'll just try again.  
You keep holding your heart inside your chest.  
Continuing to believe, trying to help. 
 
Even while you're discouraged and crying.  
Let's try to secure tomorrow with our bonds! 
 
We can shatter anything.  
Fear and fate and even the most fervent fantasies.  
Keep on burning as you break through. 
 
In the present, past and future.  
We are wishing upon the shards of dreams.  
Let's go and reach out.  
Beyond the limits.  
Until we can get ahold of them.  
Challenge the GAME.
