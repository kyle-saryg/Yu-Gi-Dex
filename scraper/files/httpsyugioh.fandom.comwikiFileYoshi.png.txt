 Biography 
 Yoshi has a problem in his legs, and needs to be kept in a wheelchair. It is unknown what the cause of his infliction is, but he needed to undergo surgery. However, he had no courage to do it.  Crow  was unsure about entering the  D1GP , so Yoshi tells him that if Crow entered the D1GP and became Duel Champion, it'd give him courage to undergo the surgery, also the prize would make the cost of the operation mean nothing. Crow then jokes about Yoshi looking like being 80, then smiles, and makes this promise with Yoshi.
 
       The promise between  Crow  and Yoshi.     
 
 Trivia 
 An omake featured in  volume 4  revealed that Yoshi was supposed to have a twin brother named Tsune at first, but with  Leo  and  Luna  already in the manga, having two sets of twins was deemed unnecessary. As a result, Tsune was removed from the manga.
