 Summary 
 Following his loss to  Aster Phoenix  during  episode 57 ,  Zane Truesdale  has fallen into a slump and has been unable to win a Duel since. After losing a recent duel in the Amateur League, he is approached by a manager named  Mr. Shroud , who offers to help him reclaim his former glory, telling him he must start at the bottom.
 He means this literally, as Zane ends up Dueling  Mad Dog  in a caged underground Dueling arena. Both Duelists wear  shock collars  that render damage to  Life Points  as actual pain. During the Duel, Zane admits that he is tired of losing and now believes that his former philosophy of respecting his opponent is flawed. He simply wants to win. Though he is losing badly the entire Duel, Zane wipes out all 15,000 of Mad Dog's Life Points in a single turn with " Chimeratech Overdragon ".
 Zane soon dons a new black leather costume, partially resembling  Seto Kaiba 's  Battle City  outfit and Atticus Rhodes's Nightshroud outfit. In the Japanese version, he changes his former moniker of  Kaiser  to  Hell Kaiser .  Syrus Truesdale  watches Zane beat a Minor league Duelist on Tv and notes how different his brother is.
 
 Featured Duels 
 Zane Truesdale vs. Unknown Duelist 
 Duel already in progress. Zane has 150 Life Points left and his opponent controls " Magical Scientist " (300/300) in Attack Position.
 Turn ?: Unknown Duelist 
"Magical Scientist" attacks directly (Zane 150 → 0).
 
 Mad Dog vs. Zane Truesdale 
 Turn 1: Mad Dog 
Mad Dog draws. He then  Normal Summons  " Acid Slime " (800/1000) in  Defense Position . When this monster is destroyed in battle and sent to the Graveyard, Zane will take 800 damage. Mad Dog then  Sets  a card.
 Turn 2: Zane 
Zane draws. He then Sets a card. Zane then  activates  " Different Dimension Capsule " to  remove  a card in his  Deck  from play. On Zane's second Standby Phase after the activation of "Different Dimension Capsule", he can destroy "Different Dimension Capsule" and add the removed card to his  hand . Since Mad Dog controls a monster and Zane controls no monsters, he  Special Summons  " Cyber Dragon " (2100/1600) from his hand in Attack Position. 
 Mad Dog then activates his face-down " Last Machine Acid Virus " to  Tribute  "Acid Slime" and  destroy  all  Machine - type  monsters on Zane's side of the  Field  and in his  hand , as well as any Machine-type monsters that he  draws  during his next three turns. For each monster destroyed this way, Zane will take 500 damage. "Cyber Dragon" is destroyed (Zane 4000 → 3500).
 Turn 3: Mad Dog 
Mad Dog draws " Contingency Fee " and subsequently activates it to force Zane to draw until he has six cards in his hand and increase his (Mad Dog's) Life Points by 1000 for each card Zane draws. Zane draws three cards (Mad Dog 4000 → 7000). Due to the Lingering effect of "Last Machine Acid Virus", Mad Dog is permitted to see the cards Zane drew to check for Machine-types. The cards drawn are " Card from a Different Dimension ", " Battle Fusion ", and " Damage Polarizer ". 
 Mad Dog then activates " Card Destruction " to force both players to  discard  their hands and draw the same amount of cards that they discarded. Mad Dog discards " Jam Defender ", " Jam Breeding Machine " and " DNA Surgery " while Zane discards " Return Soul ", " Limiter Removal ", " Polymerization ", "Card from a Different Dimension", "Battle Fusion", and "Damage Polarizer". Due to the Lingering effect of "Last Machine Acid Virus", Zane reveals he drew " Cyber Barrier Dragon ", " Power Bond ", " Cyber Laser Dragon ", " Cyber Kirin ", " Trap Booster ", and " Cyber Phoenix ". "Cyber Barrier Dragon", "Cyber Laser Dragon", "Cyber Kirin" and "Cyber Phoenix" are destroyed (Zane 3500 → 1500). Mad Dog then activates " Pot of Greed " to draw two cards (one of which is "Clone Slime"). Mad Dog then Normal Summons " Clone Slime " (0/0) in Defense Position and Sets two cards.
 Turn 4: Zane 
Zane draws " Future Fusion " and subsequently activates it to send two " Cyber Dragons " from his Deck to the Graveyard and Fusion Summon " Cyber Twin Dragon " [Notes 1] , but the summoned monster won't be allowed to attack the turn it's summoned. Mad Dog then activates his face-down " Jammer Slime " to negate the effect of "Future Fusion" and destroy it by discarding " Draw Slime ". Since "Draw Slime" was sent to the Graveyard, its effect activates, letting Mad Dog draw one card. 
 Mad Dog then activates his face-down " Despised Reality ", which gives Zane two options. The first will let Mad Dog draw two cards in exchange for Zane being permitted to Special Summon a  Level  4 or below monster from his Deck. If Zane does not choose this option, then Mad Dog will take 1000 damage during the  End Phase . Zane selects the first and Special Summons " Proto-Cyber Dragon " from his Deck (1100/600) in Attack Position, so Mad Dog draws two cards. 
 "Proto-Cyber Dragon" attacks "Clone Slime", but Mad Dog activates the latter's effect to send it to the Graveyard and Special Summon "Acid Slime" (800/1000) from his Graveyard in Defense Position as well as make it the new attack  target . "Proto-Cyber Dragon" destroys "Acid Slime". The effect of "Acid Slime" activates (Zane 1500 → 700).
 Turn 5: Mad Dog 
Mad Dog draws. He then activates " Slime Base " to Special Summon " Multiple Slime " (1500/2000) from his hand in Attack Position. "Multiple Slime" attacks and destroys "Proto-Cyber Dragon" (Zane 700 → 300). Mad Dog then Sets two cards.
 At this point, Zane attempts to quit the duel and leave but Mr. Shroud tries to convince him to let his past go and that his friends have abandoned him .
 Turn 6: Zane 
Zane draws " Cybernetic Fusion Support ". On Zane's Standby Phase, he activates the final effect of "Different Dimension Capsule", destroying it to add " Overload Fusion " to his hand. Zane then activates "Power Bond", which will allow him to Fusion Summon a Machine-type Fusion Monster by sending the appropriate Fusion Material Monsters from his hand or field to the Graveyard. The summoned monster's ATK will be doubled, but Zane will take damage equal to its original ATK on the End Phase should it still be on the field. Zane then activates "Cybernetic Fusion Support" to  pay  half his  Life Points  (Zane 300 → 150) and remove from play his three "Cyber Dragons" from his Graveyard in order to use "Cybernetic Fusion Support" as the substitute for the Fusion Material Monsters used for the Fusion Summon done by "Power Bond". "Power Bond" then  Fusion Summons  " Cyber End Dragon " (4000/2800) in Attack Position. Due to the effect of "Power Bond", the ATK of "Cyber End Dragon" is doubled ("Cyber End Dragon": 4000 → 8000/2800). Mad Dog then activates his face-down " Slime Ball " to destroy "Cyber End Dragon" and increase his Life Points by the ATK of "Cyber End Dragon" (Mad Dog: 7000 → 15000).
 Zane then activates his face-down " Call of the Haunted " to revive "Proto-Cyber Dragon" (1100/600) in Attack Position. Zane then activates "Overload Fusion" to remove from play "Proto-Cyber Dragon", "Cyber Laser Dragon", "Cyber Barrier Dragon", "Cyber Kirin", "Cyber Phoenix" and " Cyber End Dragon " from his field and Graveyard in order to Fusion Summon " Chimeratech Overdragon " (?/?) in Attack Position (Due to the effect of "Proto-Cyber Dragon", it is treated as "Cyber Dragon" while face-up on the field).
 Due to the effect of "Chimeratech Overdragon", it gains 800 ATK and DEF for each monster used in its Fusion Summon. Six monsters were used ("Chimeratech Overdragon": ? → 4800/? → 4800). "Chimeratech Overdragon" attacks and destroys "Multiple Slime" (Mad Dog 15000 → 11700). Since "Multiple Slime" was destroyed in battle and sent to the Graveyard, its effect activates, letting Mad Dog Special Summon three " Slime Monster Tokens " (500/500 each) in Attack Position. 
 Mad Dog then activates his face-down " Trap Trip " to add "Last Machine Acid Virus" from his Graveyard to his hand. Mad Dog intends to set "Last Machine Acid Virus" next turn and use it to destroy "Chimeratech Overdragon" and win the Duel. At this point Zane reveals another effect of "Chimeratech Overdragon": It may also attack a number of times equal to the number of monsters used for its Summon, so it can attack five more times. "Chimeratech Overdragon" attacks and destroys the three "Slime Tokens" (Mad Dog 11700 → 7400 → 3100 → 0).
 
 Differences in adaptations 
 Mad Dog 's voice in the dub appears to be a parody of  Mike Tyson . 
 When Zane  activates  " Overload Fusion ", the final card shown on the left as his Deck is fanned out in front of him is shown to be " Kuriboh " in the English version. In the Japanese version, the picture of said card is obscured, but it is an  EARTH - attribute   monster .
 
 Trivia 
 This episode's English title is a pun on the phrase "No pain, no gain". 
 Errors 
       Multiple Slime shown in Defense Position.     
 In the dub, when  Alexis Rhodes  rolls the magazine about Zane, the Sacred Beast cards are shown as if it wasn't dubbed. 
 In the dub, when Zane activates "Different Dimension Capsule", he states that the card removed from play via its effect will return to his Hand after three Turns, when it should be two Turns. 
 When Zane attacks " Multiple Slime " with " Chimeratech Overdragon ", "Multiple Slime" is shown to be in  Defense Position  when it was actually in  Attack Position  (since  Mad Dog  had used it to attack " Proto-Cyber Dragon " the turn before). Damage calculation is applied correctly. 
       The arrows point the Japanese cards in the Dub.     
 When Zane summons " Cyber End Dragon ", "Chimeratech Overdragon" is shown on his duel disk instead. 
 In the dub, when the Monsters used for "Chimeratech Overdragon"'s Fusion Summon are being removed from Zane's Graveyard, "Cyber Dragon" is incorrectly shown instead of "Cyber Laser Dragon".
