For the card nicknamed "Ultimate God" in the manga, see " Ultimate God Ultimaya Tzolkin ".      
         The Ultimate God's brief appearance.     
 The  Ultimate God  (究極神,  Kyūkyoku-shin ) is a being in the  Yu-Gi-Oh! 5D's  manga .  Roman  and  Rex Goodwin 's true plans involve resurrecting and controlling this being. [1] 
 The Ultimate God is located at the bottom of the  Aerial Fortress Seibal , where it has slept since ancient times. In the past,  rituals  were conducted between  Duel Priests  and  Duel Priestesses  in order to combat and seal this being, who people feared. It is said that should a Duel Priestess lose the ritual  Duel , the Ultimate God shall awaken. [2]  It also appears that in order to keep this God sealed, not only must the Duel Priestess win, but she must also be offered as a sacrifice to the God. [3] 
 In the thirtieth century B.C., Rex and Roman became  Duel Priests  and conducted the  Festival of Duality  attempting to revive this God, who was said to be able to realize any wish, in order to revive  Ish Kiq Goodwin , the previous  Duel Priestess  who was sacrificed for the ritual. For that purpose, they convinced  the Duel Priestess from that time  to lose on purpose, which caused the sun to hide and a disaster to happen, killing many people. Rex and Roman then headed towards the  Aerial Fortress Seibal  in order to reach the God; however, Rex was completely dominated by its colossal dark miasma, causing him to go crazy. [2] [3] 
 
         The Ultimate God roars.     
 In the present, Rex and Roman use  Sect Ijuin  and  Akiza Izinski  as the Duel Priests to conduct the Ritual Duel once more in an attempt to revive the Ultimate God. For that purpose, Goodwin always planned on Akiza's defeat. [2] 
 Akiza, having regained the memories of her past life, tries her best to win the Ritual Duel and halt Goodwin's plan, but she is beaten by Sect and the Ultimate God opens its eyes. [4]  With Sect's victory, he becomes the King of Earth's Lock. Rex, Roman,  Yusei  and  Jack  then conduct Duels inside Seibal in order to decide the King of Sky's Lock, who would conduct a Duel against the King of Earth's Lock which may open the Ultimate God's door and set him free. [5] 
 Yusei becomes the King of Sky's Lock and Duels against Sect. Meanwhile, Akiza is offered as a sacrifice, with the Ultimate God slowly draining her life. In the beginning of the final ritual Duel, the Ultimate God starts its resurrection, and produces a roar which thrills Yusei and Jack due to its power. [6] 
 
         The God's miasma as  Yusei 's and  Sect 's monsters prepare to deliver the final blow.     
 Once Yusei frees Sect from the miasma of his Duel Dragon and brings him back to his old self, Yusei and Sect think of a way to seal the Ultimate God for good. Sect reminds about the Skeleton Knight explaining to him about the "Light Sense", which can seal the Ultimate God. As Yusei and Sect deliver the final blow of the Duel, with the Ultimate God ready to revive, they create the "Cross Sense Final Section" - the "Light Sense" which eradicates the Ultimate God's massive miasma and puts him back to sleep, freeing Akiza. [7] 
 However, Rex Goodwin reveals he holds part of the God's shadow miasma within him and that despite it being sealed the Ultimate God can still be revived. Goodwin chants an ancient language that both Akiza and Yusei recognize as Diak in order to absorb the remaining shadow miasma from the Ultimate God. After doing so Goodwin takes out a blank card and proceeds to absorb the energy from the duelists and the cards they own from both the Aerial Fortress Seibal and the Duel Gate in order to restore the Ultimate God Ultimaya Tzolkin card to normal. Goodwin reveals that all Duel Monster cards including the Duel Dragons originated from the Ultimate God itself. [8] 
 When Rex Goodwin summons " Ultimate God Ultimaya Tzolk'in " in his Duel with Yusei, the Ultimate God awakens and breaks free from his seal. Then it transforms into its true form: a  gigantic red dragon  while being under Goodwin's control. [9]
