      The Ocean terrain     
 The  Ocean  or  Sea  field was shown briefly in  Duelist Kingdom , used by  Mako Tsunami . It powered up  WATER  monsters, as well as hid them under the water. Other monsters could not occupy it.
 In early video games, the field can be changed to Ocean by activating " Umi " which grants the  ATK  and  DEF  changing effects of " Umi " to the affected area.
