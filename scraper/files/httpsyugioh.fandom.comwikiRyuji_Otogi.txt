 Biography 
 Intro 
         Duke Devlin lineart     
 In the anime, Duke invented  Dungeon Dice Monsters  and visited  Maximillion Pegasus  to demonstrate the game shortly before the  Duelist Kingdom  tournament. Duke was impressed by Pegasus' skill at the game. Pegasus himself enjoyed the game and approved of the creation of Dungeon Dice Monsters, wanting to expand it further. Upon Pegasus' request, Duke allowed him to make additions to the game, including adding the " Dark Magician " as a monster, and hacking into  KaibaCorp 's computer system.
 When Pegasus disappeared after being defeated by  Yugi Muto  in the Duelist Kingdom tournament, Duke blamed Yugi for his disappearance and believed that Yugi must have cheated to beat a gamer as good as Pegasus. He swore to get revenge on Yugi, whom he believed didn't deserve the title "King of Games."
 After the Duelist Kingdom tournament, Duke opened the  Black Clown  (a rival game shop to the  Kame Game ) and transferred to  Domino High School , the school that Yugi and his friends attend. He quickly became popular and impressed girls with a number of dice tricks. Jealous,  Joey Wheeler  challenged Duke to a game of  Duel Monsters . They agreed to the stakes that if Joey won, Duke would close his shop, and if Duke won, Joey would be his slave for a week. Having been the runner-up in  Duelist Kingdom , Joey was certain that he would win. However, not having his own Deck, Duke insisted that they play using cards straight from  Booster Packs . Joey agreed, and they each created a brand-new Deck.
 The Duel took place at the Black Clown. Duke televised the event in the hopes of humiliating Joey. Over the first few turns, Joey knocked chunks out of Duke's  Life Points  while leaving his own unscathed, but Duke managed to turn the Duel around and take out all of Joey's Life Points in one turn.
 In keeping his end of the bargain Joey became Duke's slave. Duke further embarrassed him by having him dress in a dog suit.  Yami Yugi  was disgusted by his treatment of Joey and challenged Duke to a Duel to release Joey. Duke was not interested in Dueling and challenged Yugi to a game of Dungeon Dice Monsters. If Yugi won, Joey would be free again, but if Duke won, Yugi was to swear on his  grandfather 's life to never play  Duel Monsters  again.
 Duke also televised his game with Yugi. Having not played Dungeon Dice Monsters before, Yugi struggled at first and Duke gained an early advantage. However, Yugi made a few comebacks and ultimately won using the "Dark Magician" that Pegasus had added.
 Duke then apologized to Yugi, having realized that Yugi was an honest game player and determined that he wouldn't have cheated against Pegasus. He began to worry that the televised game was going to be bad publicity as it made him look like a bad person. However, Yugi and his friends comforted Duke, assuring him that Dungeon Dice Monsters had the potential to become a great game. Soon after, Duke received word from  Industrial Illusions  in the form of an email stating that they would be helping produce Dungeon Dice Monsters, and had agreed to make the game global.
 
 Battle City 
 Duke appeared again during  Seto Kaiba 's  Battle City  tournament, where he saved  Serenity Wheeler  and  Tristan Taylor  from  Rare Hunters , meeting  Mai Valentine  in the process. He watched the rest of the tournament along with the other characters. He is shown having a crush on Serenity, much to Tristan's disgust.
 
 Virtual World 
         Duke Devlin with his Deck Master " Strike Ninja ".     
 Duke was trapped in  Noah's Virtual World  along with the other participants aboard Seto Kaiba's Battle City Quarterfinals blimp. Along with Serenity and Tristan, Duke Dueled  Nezbitt  of  The Big Five  with the stakes being ownership of his body and the ability to return to the real world. At one point during the game, after drawing the  Magic Card  " Dice Dungeon ", Duke turned the arena into a Dice Monsters  Dungeon , confidently telling Nezbitt, “You don’t know me, but let’s just say I know a thing or two about dice.”
 
 Battle City finals 
 Duke helps Joey when he collapses from his Duel with  Yami Marik , and he cheers for Yugi during the Battle City finals. He parts with the group at the end of the finals, slipping Serenity his phone number, much to Tristan's anger.
 
 Waking the Dragons 
 During the  Waking the Dragons  arc, Duke was again reunited with the group after saving Rex Raptor and Weevil Underwood while they were lost in America. He helped them when they convinced him that they were friends of Yugi's. He assisted Yugi, Joey, and Kaiba against the  Doma  Organization and took part in a Duel with  Rebecca Hawkins  against  Valon . For most of this Duel, his cards involved increasing the strength of Rebecca's dragon monsters. Despite summoning a powerful dragon, Valon beat them with his  Armor monsters . Duke and Rebecca's souls were not taken after their loss as Valon never played the " The Seal of Orichalcos " during their Duel. However, he was unable to give the gang support later on because of being in another place during Yugi and Kaiba's Duel with  Dartz .
 
 KC Grand Championship 
 Duke tagged along with Yugi and his friends during the  KC Grand Championship . During the final episode, he said that he has a date with Serenity, and Tristan and Joey attack him for even saying so (it is unknown whether he was telling the truth or joking).
 
 Ceremonial Battle 
 During the  Dawn of the Duel  arc, Duke helped take care of Solomon Muto and contacted Yugi's friends and other important people, such as Maximillion Pegasus, about Yugi's absence. He accompanied Yugi to the Ceremonial Battle. He witnessed the Pharaoh's departure to the spirit world and the sealing away of the seven Millennium Items.
 
 Voice and Mannierisms 
 In the japanese version uses "boku".
