 Lucien Grimley , known in Japan as  Ikkaku Tachibana 「橘一角」( Tachibana Ikkaku ) is a  Duelist  who enters the  Genex Tournament  from  North Academy . As a failing Duelist, Lucien makes a deal with the malevolent spirit of the forbidden and cursed " Grim Reaper " card sealed by the school, selling his soul to obtain incredible  draw  power. 
 In the English dub, Lucien makes death-related puns while using the "Grim Reaper". 
 The reaper imbues his right hand with the symbol of itself. Although he claims that his goal is to be victor of the Genex Tournament, his true wish was to experience a trusting bond with his Deck. He eventually loses to  Jaden Yuki  but promises not to lose trust in himself again. To that end, he threw the Reaper's card away, committed to winning without its assistance.
 
       Lucien's linework..     
 Lucien is also notable for being the first Duelist in the entirety of the  Yu-Gi-Oh!  anime series to be portrayed as left-handed or ambidextrous. He draws with his right hand while influenced by the Grim Reaper, but is able to switch to his left hand with ease.
 
 Deck 
 Lucien plays a  Reaper/ Slash Draw   FTK  Deck , which uses various  Spell Cards  to force his opponents to automatically play or  Set  cards on the  field . This allows Lucien to build up a certain number of cards on the field before he  activates  " Slash Draw " to instantly wipe out his opponents'  Life Points  after he  draws  another copy from his  Deck . In the event that Lucien fails to defeat his opponent through a  One Turn Kill , he will Summon " Invincible Demise Lord ", who can  revive  itself with immunity to destruction by  card effects  when it is destroyed in battle, allowing it to survive the effect of "Slash Draw", which would destroy it under normal circumstances.
