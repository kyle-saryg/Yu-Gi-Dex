 Biography 
 Playmaker wishes to get back Jin, Soulburner, and Flame to rebuild the Cyberse World, and Blue Maiden and Aqua to save  Miyu Sugisaki . The supporters of this group are  Cal Kolter ,  Ghost Gal , and  Akira Zaizen .
 Later on, Playmaker and his allies would join forces with the  Knights of Hanoi , with  Varis  and  Specter  joining the main team and  Dr. Genome ,  Faust , and  Baira  provide technical support from the real world.
 Every member of this faction apart from Playmaker and Ai ended up being erased or absorbed by Lightning and his faction.
 As of Season 3, the group is now reformed with new members such as Gore and The Shepherd to stop Ai who is attacking  SOL Technologies . Unfortunately, Ghost Gal, The Shepherd, Specter, Akira Zaizen, and the three  Knights   of   Hanoi  members have been defeated and erased by Ai and Roboppy.
 After Ai's defeat, the group reformed, and was restored back to normal. The members went their own separate ways, and experienced new lives for that is to come.
