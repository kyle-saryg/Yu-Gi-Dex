 Summary 
 Reused footage 
 The following are events from the  previous episode , which were shown again at the start of this episode. 
 Yusei  and  Aporia  have just entered the old  B.A.D.  area to continue their Duel. Aporia uses the effect of " Meklord Astro Mekanikle " to send " Wisel Attack 5 " to the  Graveyard , allowing "Mekanikle" to inflict double  Piercing  damage. Yusei reminds Aporia that he still has " Scrap-Iron Scarecrow ", which can  negate  the attack. However Aporia calls that useless, since "Wisel Attack 5" has an additional effect, which prevents the activation of his opponent's Trap Cards when it attacks.
 Leo ,  Luna  and  Bruno  calculate that Yusei is due to lose 3000 Life Points, although he only has 2800.  Jack  and  Crow  try getting out of their beds, fearing what will happen to the city if Yusei loses.
 Back at the Duel, Aporia asks what Yusei thinks of the taste of despair.
 
 New footage 
 The  MC  commentates that Yusei still has his ace " Shooting Star Dragon " and wonders if it will survive another attack.
 Aporia claims that he will emerge victorious next turn and the  Grand Design  will be complete and when that happens limitless amounts of  Ener-D  will be released and the  Ark Cradle  will appear in order to guide  New Domino . The destruction will lead to the start of a new future free of despair, he feels.
 Yusei wonders what he can do to destroy "Meklord Astro Meknikle", while Aporia brags that they shall go to a new future.
 Team Ragnarok  watch the Duel and hope for Yusei to hang in just a little longer.  Lazar  presses his face against a window and begs for God to save them.
 Inside the B.A.D., Crow and Jack, now out of the infirmary, race up to the Duel on their own  Duel Runners . Team 5D's watch in anticipation and wonder if the two of them will be okay. Jack and Crow tell Yusei that they have come to join him, as they still have a battle to finish. Yusei tries to talk them out of it, as it's too dangerous with them still injured from losing to  Jakob . That's of no interest to Jack and Crow, who feel that this burden doesn't just belong to Yusei and they should be sharing it. Thinking of the three of them, Yusei remembers that he hasn't yet used the card that Jack left him. Since the cards contain the bonds between the three of them, he thinks he can't lose.
 Aporia gets "Meklord Astro Mekanikle" to attack "Shooting Star Dragon" with its " Cube of Despair " attack. Yusei activates "Scrap-Iron Scarecrow". Aporia repeats that that move is useless as the effect of "Wisel Attack 5" negates and destroys  Trap Cards . However once "Scrap-Iron Scarecrow" is destroyed, Yusei reminds him that he can only destroy 1 Trap Card and then proceeds to use Jack's card, " Revenge Twin Soul ". By  removing  2  Synchro Monsters  in his Graveyard from play, "Shooting Star Dragon" gains  DEF  equal to their combined  Levels  x 100. He removes " Red Nova Dragon " and " Black-Winged Dragon ", giving "Shooting Star Dragon" 2000 more DEF, raising it to 4500. If the attacking monster's  ATK  is lower than the target monster's DEF, the attacking monster is also destroyed. "Shooting Star Dragon" withstands the blast and it is deflected back at "Mekanikle". However, Aporia uses an effect of "Mekanikle" to remove a " Meklord Emperor " component from his Graveyard from play to negate the destruction. He removes " Granel Carrier ", saving "Mekanikle", but he still takes 500  Battle Damage , dropping his Life Points to 3400.
 The stadium is almost empty apart from Team 5D's, but the MC continues to commentate, explaining that Yusei has evaded the attack and inflicted damage. Leo thinks that it's too bad Yusei didn't manage to destroy "Mekanikle" too, but Luna's optimistic over Yusei inflicting some damage. Lazar thanks God and begs for Yusei to win.
 Aporia admits that Yusei is stronger than he had thought, but insists that resistance is futile and all will still be lost. Aporia  Sets  1 card in his  Spell & Trap Card Zone  and ends his turn. The DEF of "Shooting Star Dragon" returns to 2500 as the effect of "Revenge Twin Soul" wears off.
 Crow says that it is time for a counterattack. Yusei begins his turn and both players'  SPC  rises to 3. Since he has at least 2  Speed Counters , Yusei activates " Speed Spell - Angel Baton ",  drawing  2 cards and sending " Guard Master " to the Graveyard. He then activates his  face-down  " Dimension Voyage " to  Special Summon  as many of his  removed from play  Synchro Monsters as he can. He Summons "Red Nova Dragon" and "Black-Winged Dragon", the cards Jack and Crow left for him. Yusei explains that the turn those monsters are Special Summoned, their effects are negated, they cannot attack and are removed from play during the  End Phase . Aporia wonders what Yusei is planning to do with monsters that can't attack or use their effects. Yusei switches "Shooting Star Dragon" to  Attack Mode  and activates " Trust Chain ". This allows him to increase the ATK of "Shooting Star Dragon" by the total ATK of all Synchro Monsters he controls, but prevents Synchro Monsters from attacking. The ATK of "Shooting Star Dragon" rises to 9600. Jack says that Yusei has done it and Crow claims that their bonds will bring them through despair. Yusei adds that no amount of despair can affect their bonds, which will carve a new future for themselves.
 Since "Shooting Star Dragon" has 9600 ATK and Aporia has only 3400 Life Points, the MC calculates that if this attack works, Yusei will win. Leo points out that "Trust Chain" prevents Synchro Monsters from attacking, but Bruno reminds him that the effect of " Salvagent " is preventing "Shooting Star Dragon" from being treated as a Synchro Monster.
 Yusei speeds on, as lightning hits a nearby building, knocking it over. Yusei gets "Shooting Star Dragon" to attack "Mekanikle". Aporia asks if Yusei has not realized yet that true despair cannot be beaten so easily and activates " Banishing Climb ". It removes all Synchro Monsters from play. A hole cracks in the sky, which "Red Nova Dragon" and "Black-Winged Dragon" are sucked into it, before it reseals itself. Without them "Shooting Star Dragon" loses its ATK increase from "Trust Chain", bringing it back down to 3300. Leo starts to worry since "Shooting Star Dragon" now has less ATK than "Mekanikle", but Yusei uses the other effect of "Trust Chain", by sending "Trust Chain" to the Graveyard, he ends the Battle Phase, cancelling the attack.
 The effect of "Banishing Climb" causes "Red Nova Dragon" and "Black-Winged Dragon" to be returned to the field at the end of the Battle Phase and negates their effects. Akiza sees this as a problem; "Banishing Climb" has overwritten the effect of "Trust Chain", so the two dragons will remain on the field. Luna realizes that Yusei had wanted the dragons to be removed from play during the End Phase. Leo doesn't see what immediate affect this will have, and Akiza explains that on the next turn Aporia will be able to use the effect of "Mekanikle" to absorb Synchro Monsters.
 Aporia tells Yusei to end his turn quickly and asks how he will deal with true despair. The MC points out the problem with the Synchro Monsters too and adds that Team 5D's is truly in an ultimate pinch. Yusei Sets 1 card in his Spell & Trap Card Zone and ends his turn.
 Aporia begins his turn and uses the effect of "Mekanikle" to  equip  itself with "Red Nova Dragon" and gain ATK equal to that of the equipped monster. The ATK of "Mekanikle" rises to 7500. Aporia sends " Granel Top 5 " from his hand to the Graveyard so that "Mekanikle" can gain its effects. This allows it to absorb another Synchro Monster. He takes "Black-Winged Dragon" and the ATK rises to 10300. Aporia then asks Yusei to watch as he changes the future.
 Aporia is confident that the Duel's victor is already decided. With 10300 ATK, one attack from "Mekanikle" is enough to end it all and the new future will be realized. A few more lines on the  Grand Design  are formed as he says this.
 The MC points explains how Team 5D's has just had 2 Synchro Monsters absorbed, bringing "Mekanikle" up to 10300 ATK and asks if the Duel is over. Lazar falls to his knees, praying for it to stop.
 "Mekanikle" attacks "Shooting Star Dragon", but Yusei activates the effect of "Guard Master", removing it from his Graveyard from play to change "Shooting Star Dragon" to Defense Mode and make it unable to be destroyed by battle. The attack is deflected from "Shooting Star Dragon" and hits a nearby building, damaging it. Lazar breathes a sigh of relief.
 During the End Phase, Aporia uses another effect of "Mekanikle". By sending a Synchro Monster equipped to it to the Graveyard, he can inflict damage to Yusei equal to the ATK of that Synchro Monster. He chooses "Red Nova Dragon", which has 3500 ATK. The ATK of "Mekanikle" is lowered to 6800. Jack and Crow start to panic as this is enough damage to defeat Yusei if it succeeds. However Yusei activates " Hardship ". He equips it to "Shooting Star Dragon", lowering its ATK and DEF to 0, but lowering all the  effect damage  inflicted by "Mekanikle" to 0. Aporia declares that he shall use the effect of "Mekanikle" again, sending "Black-Winged Dragon" to the Graveyard this time. Yusei is puzzled why he would do that, knowing that "Hardship" will reduce the damage again. "Black-Winged Dragon" is sent to the Graveyard, lowering the ATK of "Mekanikle" to 0. Yusei activates "Hardship" again to prevent the damage again. However once that resolves, Aporia activates " Infinite Feast " to reequip "Black-Winged Dragon" and "Red Nova Dragon" to "Mekanikle" and inflict 600 damage per monster to Yusei for each time "Mekanikle" has been equipped with a Synchro Monster this turn. Since the 2 dragons were equipped during the Standby Phase and during the End Phase, Jack calculates Yusei will lose 2400 damage. Crow wishes Yusei had "Black-Winged Dragon" to negate the damage. Aporia calls out "Eat this" as Yusei is hit by the blast, lowering his Life Points to 400. Team 5D's all breath a sign of relief when Yusei manages to maintain control of his Duel Runner after the blast. "Infinite Feast" also causes Aporia to gain 600 Life Points, bringing him up to 4000. With the two Synchro Monsters equipped, "Mekanikle" has its ATK brought back to 10300. Aporia ends his turn, telling Yusei that the next turn will be when he settles everything.
 With only 400 Life Points left, Yusei fears that if he takes any more damage he will lose. Jack discourages Yusei from hesitating, reminding him that their bonds are not broken so easily. Crow adds that their bonds shall lead them to victory, while over in the pitstop, Luna and Akiza with their Marks of the Dragon glowing, wish Yusei luck. Yusei looks at his mark and thinks he hasn't lost hope. Thinking this last card is his final hope, he asks his Deck to answer his call before drawing it. The card starts to glow and Yusei draws. His and Aporia's SPC both up to 5 and he looks at the card he just drew; " Mystic Piper ".
 Yusei activates the effect of "Hardship", destroying it and subsequently the equipped monster; "Shooting Star Dragon". Aporia is surprised by this, but the effect also destroys all Equip Cards on the field, including "Red Nova Dragon" and "Black-Winged Dragon". The ATK of "Mekanikle" is returned to its original 4000. Jack is glad to see its ATK lowered, but Aporia points out that Yusei's field is now empty, leaving him with no way to defeat it.
 Yusei says that his turn isn't over and Summons "Mystic Piper". He  Releases  it to draw a card and if that card is a monster, he can draw another. Yusei gets " Sonic Chick ", allowing him to draw another, saying that in his hand lies hope.
 Yusei activates his face-down " Ghoul Summoner " to revive a Synchro Monster destroyed this turn and equip it with "Ghoul Summoner". He chooses "Black-Winged Dragon". Aporia asks does Yusei not get it, Synchro Monsters are no match for "Mekanikle". The other effect of "Ghoul Summoner", allows Yusei to discard 1 card to revive another Synchro Monster and take damage equal to its ATK. He chooses "Red Nova Dragon". Aporia wonders if Yusei is really going to take that damage, but Crow points out the effect of "Black-Winged Dragon". "Black-Winged Dragon" gains 1  Black Feather Counter , causing it to lose 700 ATK, but also negates the damage. Jack declares that "Red Nova Dragon" gains 500 ATK for every Tuner monster in the Graveyard; " Mono Synchron " and " Formula Synchron ", thus bringing its ATK to 4500. Yusei then uses the effect of "Ghoul Summoner" again. He discards another card to revive "Shooting Star Dragon". "Black-Winged Dragon" negates the damage again, by gaining another Black Feather Counter.
 Seeing Yusei Summon three Synchro Monsters in one turn, Aporia wonders if this is the true power of a Signer. Yusei tells Aporia that the despair will be overpowered by hope.
 
 Featured Duel: Yusei Fudo vs. Aporia 
 ... continued from the previous episode. 
 Turn 20: Aporia 
Aporia has just used the effect of " Meklord Astro Mekanikle " to send " Wisel Attack 5 " from his hand to the Graveyard and give "Mekanikle" the effects of "Wisel Attack 5" until the End Phase. "Meklord Astro Mekanikle"  attacks  " Shooting Star Dragon ", but Yusei activates his face-down " Scrap-Iron Scarecrow " to negate the attack, however Aporia activates the "Wisel Attack 5"-granted effect of "Meklord Astro Mekanikle" to negate and destroy "Scrap-Iron Scarecrow". Yusei then activates his face-down " Revenge Twin Soul " to  remove from play  " Red Nova Dragon " and " Black-Winged Dragon " from his Graveyard and increase the  DEF  of "Shooting Star Dragon" by 2000 (the increase is equal to the combined Levels of the removed monsters times 100) ("Shooting Star Dragon": 3300/2500 → 4500). The attack fails (Aporia 3900 → 3400). 
 The second effect of "Revenge Twin Soul" activates, destroying "Meklord Astro Mekanikle" at the end of the Damage Step, but Aporia activates the third effect of "Mekanikle" to remove from play " Granel Carrier " from his Graveyard and prevent "Mekanikle" from being destroyed. Aporia  Sets  a card. on Aporia's  End Phase , the effect of "Revenge Twin Soul" expires ("Shooting Star Dragon": 3300/4500 → 2500).
 Turn 21: Yusei Fudo 
Yusei draws " Speed Spell - Angel Baton ". During the Standby Phase, the effect of " Speed World 2 " activates (Yusei's SPC: 2 → 3; Aporia's SPC: 2 → 3). Yusei then activates "Speed Spell - Angel Baton" to draw two cards ("Ghoul Summoner" and "Guard Master") and send "Guard Master" from his hand to the Graveyard. Yusei then activates his face-down " Dimension Voyage " to  Special Summon  "Red Nova Dragon" ( 12/3500/3000) and "Black-Winged Dragon" ( 8/2800/1600) in Attack Position at the cost of negating the effects of the Special Summoned monsters and forbidding them from attacking. Yusei then switches "Shooting Star Dragon" to  Attack Position  ( 10/3300/2500). 
 Yusei activates his face-down " Trust Chain " to increase the ATK of "Shooting Star Dragon" by the ATK of all Synchro Monsters Yusei controls ("Shooting Star Dragon": 3300 → 9600/2500), however no Synchro Monsters Yusei controls can attack while "Trust Chain" is face-up ("Shooting Star Dragon" does not contribute to the ATK boost and is not affected by the attacking restriction as it is currently not treated as a  Synchro Monster  due to it being revived by the effect of " Salvagent " in the previous episode). 
 "Shooting Star Dragon" attacks "Meklord Astro Mekanikle", but Aporia activates his face-down " Banishing Climb " to remove from play "Red Nova Dragon" and "Black-Winged Dragon" ("Shooting Star Dragon": 9600 → 3300/2500). Yusei activates the second effect of "Trust Chain" to destroy itself and end the  Battle Phase . At the end of the Battle Phase, the second effect of "Banishing Climb" activates, returning "Red Nova Dragon" ( 12/3500/3000) and "Black-Winged Dragon" ( 8/2800/1600) to the field in Attack Position with their effects negated. Yusei Sets a card.
 Turn 22: Aporia 
Aporia draws. During the Standby Phase, the effect of "Speed World 2" activates (Yusei's SPC: 3 → 4; Aporia's SPC: 3 → 4). Aporia then activates the effect of "Meklord Astro Mekanikle", equipping itself with "Red Nova Dragon" ("Mekanikle": 4000 → 7500/4000). Aporia then activates the second effect of "Mekanikle" to send " Granel Top 5 " from his hand to the Graveyard and grant its effects to "Mekanikle" until the End Phase. Aporia then activates the "Granel Top 5"-granted effect of "Mekanikle" to equip itself with "Black-Winged Dragon" ("Mekanikle": 7500 → 10300/4000). 
 "Mekanikle" attacks "Shooting Star Dragon", but Yusei removes from play " Guard Master " from his Graveyard in order to switch "Shooting Star Dragon" to Defense Position and prevent it from being destroyed by battle. The attack continues, but "Shooting Star Dragon" isn't destroyed.
 During the  End Phase , Aporia activates the final effect of "Mekanikle" and sends "Red Nova Dragon" to the Graveyard ("Mekanikle": 10300 → 6800/4000), but Yusei activates his face-down " Hardship ", equipping the latter to "Shooting Star Dragon" and reducing the ATK and DEF of "Shooting Star Dragon to 0 ("Shooting Star Dragon": 3300 → 0/2500 → 0) in order to reduce all damage he would take from the effect of "Mekanikle" this turn to 0. Aporia then activates the final effect of "Mekanikle" and sends "Black-Winged Dragon" to the Graveyard ("Mekanikle": 6800 → 4000/4000), but Yusei takes no damage. 
 Aporia activates his face-down " Infinite Feast " to take "Red Nova Dragon" and "Black-Winged Dragon" from the Graveyard and equip them onto "Mekanikle" ("Mekanikle": 4000 → 10300/4000). After that is done, "Infinite Feast" inflicts 2400 damage to Yusei (Yusei 2800 → 400) (600 damage for each time that a Synchro Monster got equipped onto a Meklord this turn) while Aporia gains 600 Life Points (Aporia 3400 → 4000).
 Turn 23: Yusei Fudo 
Yusei draws "Mystic Piper". During the Standby Phase, the effect of "Speed World 2" activates (Yusei's SPC: 4 → 5; Aporia's SPC: 4 → 5). Yusei activates the second effect of "Hardship" to send itself to the Graveyard and destroy "Shooting Star Dragon" and all Equip Cards on the field ("Meklord Astro Mekanikle": 10300 → 4000/4000). Yusei Normal Summons " Mystic Piper " ( 1/0/0) in Attack Position. Yusei then activates the effect of "Mystic Piper" to Tribute itself and draw one card (" Sonic Chick "). Since Yusei drew a monster, he activates the second effect of "Mystic Piper" to draw one more card (" Graceful Revival "). Yusei activates his face-down " Ghoul Summoner " to revive "Black-Winged Dragon" ( 8/2800/1600) in Attack Position and equip it with "Ghoul Summoner". 
 Yusei then activates the second effect of "Ghoul Summoner" to discard "Sonic Chick" and revive "Red Nova Dragon" ( 12/3500 → 4500/3000) in Attack Position and take damage equal to its ATK. Yusei then uses the effect of "Black-Winged Dragon" to place one "Black Feather Counter" on "Black-Winged Dragon" and nullify the damage ("Black-Winged Dragon": 2800 → 2100/1600). Yusei activates the second effect of "Ghoul Summoner" to discard "Graceful Revival" and revive "Shooting Star Dragon" ( 10/3300/2500) in Attack Position. Yusei then uses the effect of "Black-Winged Dragon" to place another "Black Feather Counter" on "Black-Winged Dragon" in order to nullify the damage ("Black-Winged Dragon": 2100 → 1400/1600).

 Mistakes 
         The animation went strange at one point in the episode.     
 In the dub, when Aporia ended his turn, the DEF of "Shooting Star Dragon" displayed are 4000 instead of 4500. 
 In the dub, when Yusei used the second effect of "Hardship" to destroy "Shooting Star Dragon" and all Equip Cards, the ATK of "Meklord Astro Mekanikle" decreased from 10300 to 0400, instead of to 4000. 
 When  Aporia  was removing " Granel Guard " to negate the destruction of " Meklord Astro Mekanikle ", in the English version,  Granel Attack  was removed instead, even though "Granel Guard" was still shown. 
 When Aporia activates "Meklord Astro Mekanikle's" ability to remove "Black-Winged Dragon from play, its Level is shown as 10 instead of 12. 
 When  Yusei  drew " Sonic Chick " from his deck via the effect of " Mystic Piper ", he then drew another card.  Yusei  said the second that was drawn was "Ghoul Summoner". He then said, "I now play the card I drew! The trap, Ghoul Summoner!" 
 When Aporia's "Mekanikle" attacked, Aporia's shoulder was painted improperly.
