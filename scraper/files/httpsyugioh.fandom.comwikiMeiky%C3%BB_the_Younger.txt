 Biography 
 The Meikyû Brothers were hired by  Maximillion J. Pegasus  to work as  Player Killers  in his  Duelist Kingdom  tournament. The two Dueled as a team, with their " Labyrinth Wall " card enabling them to change the playing field to resemble a complicated  underground labyrinth . The two guard an  underground area  of  the island . It is here that they met  Yugi Mutou  and  Katsuya Jonouchi , who needed to defeat the brothers in order to pass and move on to  Pegasus Castle . They began a Tag Duel, in which the brothers had a cohesive strategy, with their Decks built to play off of each other. In addition to changing the gameplay, the brothers' Decks focused on the Summoning of their powerful " Gate Guardian " monster, by gathering its component pieces onto the field.
 Although they came close to victory, the brothers were defeated when  Dark Yugi  and Jonouchi's " Black Skull Dragon ", powered by " Copycat " mimicking the brothers " Ryoku ", defeated their "Gate Guardian". With their victory, Yugi and Jonouchi obtained enough  Star Chips  to qualify for the tournament's final rounds. However, the brothers had another test that Yugi and Jonouchi needed to pass. They informed them that one of two doors was the true exit. The brothers claim that from then on, one of them would speak only lies, while the other would speak only the truth. Dark Yugi realized that both brothers were lying and tricked into admitting this via the use of a two-headed coin. He and Jonouchi were then able to move on.
