 Design 
 Appearance 
       Linework.     
 Axel Brody is of African descent. Unlike most students, Axel does not wear a school uniform, instead sporting a red tank top and black sleeveless vest and pants. He wears a gold pendant of unknown origin around his neck.
 
 Voice/Mannerisms 
 In the Japanese version, he occasionally speaks in English, and uses the word, " sōten " (送達) when sending monsters to the Graveyard to activate the effects of his " Blaze Accelerator " cards, thereby "dispatching" them.
 In the dub, the character is named Axel Brodie, after Axel Foley from the " Beverly Hills Cop " films.
 
 Abilities 
 Axel wields a retractable  Duel Disk  resembling a gun which can be stored in a holster at his waist. The disk can function as an actual gun, albeit one that fires cards. In the past, he trained extensively with his  father  (a mercenary) on jungle terrain, learning the art of survival. During his time at  West Academy , he adapted these skills to the performance of life-threatening wire stunts to master his drawing technique.
 
 Biography 
 Unlike the other overseas champions, Axel and  Thelonious Viper  do not leave their cabins for the duration of the journey to  Duel Academy . The two of them do, however, meet to discuss matters in private. Shortly after the beginning of the third year, Viper orders Axel to engage in a  Survival Duel  with  Jaden Yuki . While Viper regards him as his "long-cherished hope," he does not care whether Axel claims victory or is defeated; his true interests lie in the realization of Jaden's full potential as a Duelist, so that his  Bio-Bands  may absorb all his Duel energy. Before Axel has the opportunity to confront him, he is approached by  Syrus Truesdale , who he takes hostage in order to gain Jaden's cooperation. During the Duel, he is reminded of one of his  father 's teachings by Jaden's determination and spirit: although he is a "dog of battle," he must also protect his own life and be a passionate and burning warrior. He resolves to facing Jaden on his own terms, which Viper considers traitorous, but ultimately allows himself to be defeated in order to complete his mission. 
 Unsettled by the differences between the Survival Duels of West Academy and those taking place on the island, Axel searches Viper's hideout, discovering that he is operating out of the abandoned lab where  Wheeler  was trained. Arriving there moments after the Duel between  Chazz Princeton  and  Adrian Gecko , he demands that Viper reveal his true intentions for coming to Duel Academy. When the man refuses and insults his father, Axel attacks him, but is locked in a pit for his insolence. He eventually escapes and assists Jaden and company in reaching Viper. He is later found alive after having seemingly been crushed under a facility door. 
 
         Axel's Duel Disk     
 After Jesse sacrifices himself during the duel to save  Duel Academy , Axel joins Jaden and the others in a mission to rescue  Jesse Anderson  from the alternate dimension. After Jaden becomes  The Supreme King , he and  Jim Crocodile Cook  team up to oppose him. Upon witnessing Jim's defeat, Axel is alarmed by the king's strength and lack of remorse, and runs away scared from the castle with the  Eye of Orichalcum  in tow. Deeply disturbed, Axel tries to hide from the king, but after encouragement from a village that resists him - as well as Jim's sacrifice - Axel defends the village from the Supreme King's Army and one of  the Supreme King's lieutenants , thus becoming a local hero. He then teams up with  Aster Phoenix ,  Zane Truesdale , and  Syrus  and assaults the king's castle, bypassing  The Duelists of Death  and challenging Jaden to a Duel. The Duel ends up as a  stalemate , but Axel is able to lift the King's influence from Jaden with the Eye of Orichalcum at the cost of his own life.
 He is later discovered to be alive, and held prisoner with everyone else who died in the Duel Monsters Spirit World in an alternate dimension by  Yubel . He was returned to Duel Academy by Jaden after Jaden's and Yubel's souls fused.
 At the beginning of the fourth season, he returns on a mission from  Industrial Illusions , and saves  Atticus Rhodes  from  Yusuke Fujiwara . He later gives Jaden information about Yusuke, telling him that Yusuke had been missing from Duel Academy. After Jaden's Duel with Atticus, he appears to help Jaden from  Honest . He later investigates  Domino City  after its population begins to disappear under  Trueman 's attack. He later falls into a trap and Duels Trueman, but only to lose after succumbing to visions of a fire that his family was trapped in when he was a kid. Axel disappears and his parents forget that he ever existed. He is revived after Jaden defeats  Nightshroud  and was last seen alongside Alexis and Jesse at the graduation ceremony held at Duel Academy.
