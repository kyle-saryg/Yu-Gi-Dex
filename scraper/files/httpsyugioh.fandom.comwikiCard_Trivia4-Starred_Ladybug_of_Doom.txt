 This monster appears in the artwork of " Verdant Sanctuary ". 
 This card can be considered to be one of the first  Anti-Meta  cards. The initial  metagame  was all about  Beatdown  strategies (mostly with  Level 4  monsters). This card was most likely meant to serve as one possible direct counter for this formerly mainstream method of play.
