 Summary 
 The Duel between  Chazz Princeton  and  Axel Brodie  continues, with the latter having just been overtaken by  Tragoedia . Chazz realizes that he's no longer facing Axel, and is instead facing the same monster he faced when he dueled  David Rabb .
 Elsewhere,  Syrus Truesdale  regains consciousness after having lost to  Jesse Anderson . The latter appears not to remember having been controlled by Tragoedia, and isn't sure he had won the Duel until Syrus confirms it. Syrus says that he felt all the energy drain from his body after his loss and thus lost consciousness. He is about to ask something in regards to Jesse's Summoning of the " The Tripper Mercury ", but Jesse runs off after spotting a red dragonfly.
 Axel  activates  the  effect  of " The Blazing Mars ",  Tributing  his four " Machine Tokens " to inflict 2000 damage to Chazz, leaving him with only 100  Life Points . Axel  attacks  " Light End Dragon " with "Mars", but Chazz activates his  face-down  " Durability (Dragon's Endurance) ", halving the  ATK  of "Light End" to prevent its  destruction in battle  and reduce the  Battle Damage  to 0. Axel is impressed by Chazz's tenacity and Chazz begins his turn,  drawing  " Light and Darkness Dragon ". He activates the effect of "Light End", reducing its ATK and  DEF  by 500 to reduce the ATK and DEF of "Mars" by 1500. Chazz then activates his face-down " Immortal Dragon ",  Special Summoning  " Dynamite Dragon " from his  Graveyard . He Tributes both  monsters  to  Normal Summon  "Light and Darkness Dragon".
 Through Axel, Tragoedia, calls "Light and Darkness Dragon" "the ghost of  those priests " and the  Feather of Ma'at . He states that when he returns to his full form, he'll be able to fulfill his three thousand-year old grudge. He releases his hold on Axel, realizing he cannot get his revenge in his current, incomplete state. Axel cannot recall what's happened, but does remember another presence in his body. Chazz attacks "Mars" with "Light and Darkness Dragon", winning the Duel. Axel questions if the Duel had turned into a  Shadow Duel . Chazz asks if Axel is back to his senses and demands to know where Axel obtained "Mars" from. Axel cannot remember. Chazz realizes that Tragoedia has erased Axel's memory, and recalls  Jaden Yuki  telling him that Tragoedia's goal was to obtain " Winged Kuriboh " and "Light and Darkness Dragon". He heads towards the mountains, knowing that Jaden's Duel had taken place there. He believes Tragoeida would have already appeared to Jaden as well.
 Jaden is in the midst of his Duel with  Atticus Rhodes , with Tragoeida controlling the latter. Jaden's  field  is empty and he has 1800 Life Points. Atticus has " Synthesize Sphere ", " Troposphere ", a  Set  card and 2900 Life Points. Jaden thinks that whether he's controlled by a monster or not, Atticus is definitely one of the two best Duelists at  Duel Academy . Despite this, he knows he must win to awaken  Koyo Hibiki . He  Normal Summons  " Masked Hero Bassols " and then activates " Mask Change II ". This lets him  discard  a card and Tribute a " Masked Hero " to  Transformation Summon  a "Masked Hero" of the same  attribute  of the Tributed monster. He Tributes the  EARTH -attribute "Bassols" to Summon " Masked Hero Dian " in  Attack Position . "Daian" attacks and destroys "Synthesize Sphere", reducing Atticus to 1100 Life Points. This activates the effect of "Daian", letting Jaden Special Summon a  Level  4 or lower monster from his  Deck  when it destroys a monster in battle. He Summons "Winged Kuriboh" in Attack Position. Tragoedia senses it as the final piece of him, perplexing Jaden. Atticus activates his face-down " Atmospheric Regeneration ", Special Summoning " Breeze Sphere " from his Graveyard as a " Sphere " was destroyed in battle. Jaden  Sets  " Transcendent Wings " to end his turn, urging Atticus to come and get him.
 Atticus draws " The Suppression Pluto ", commenting that he's drawn the perfect card. He activates " The Eye of Truth ", forcing Jaden to reveal his  hand , which contains " Masked Hero Dusk Crow " and " Mask Change ". Jaden is confused as why Atticus checked his hand. Atticus Tributes "Troposphere" and "Breeze Sphere" to Summon "Pluto", which he calls the "Devil of Hades". He activates its effect. He may declare a card name once per  turn . If that card is in the opponent's hand, he gains  control  one card on his opponent's field for the duration of the turn. He declares "Mask Change" and takes control of Jaden's face-down "Transcendent Wings", confirming his suspicions as to what the card was. Tragoedia declares that he will now take back the piece of himself and that he's been awaiting this day for three thousand years. He then states that Jaden's greatest wish has now died out. "Pluto" attacks and destroys "Winged Kuriboh" and Jaden's Life Points fall to 0.

 Mistakes 
       " Winged Kuriboh " with its  Level  as two     .
