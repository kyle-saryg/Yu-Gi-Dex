 Summary 
       Kite Tenjo  and  Quinton  speed towards the Space  Duel Field .     
 Quinton  and  Kite  speed towards the Space  Duel Field . Quinton says that Kite has finally come, while Kite says "Chris", before correcting himself and calling him Quinton instead. Kite recalls watching Quinton leave years ago, and wonders why he did. At the  Duel Coaster Stadium ,  Bronk  wonders what's going on, as they haven't shown any  Duels  in a while. He wonders if Yuma is alright and  Caswell  adds that something's not right here.  Orbital 7  suddenly speeds through the air, flying towards the entrance to the  Duel Coaster 's underground section. He says he can't wait for Kite anymore - he needs to go to him now, even if Kite will turn him to scrap for following. 
 Yuma  speeds along on his Duel Coaster, having no clue where's he going.  Tori  tells him to slow down, but Yuma says he has to find an opponent.  Astral  says if he isn't careful and Tori finishes by saying they'll hit a trap again. There's an explosion overhead and Yuma wonders if someone else hit a trap. Orbital 7 comes flying through the air out of the explosion and lands on the coaster between Yuma and Tori. He calls them "the crazy duo". Tori asks if he's alright, and Orbital calls her "the scary girl". Tori angrily grabs him and threatens to throw him off the coaster (in the dub, Tori instead threatens to rearrange Orbital's wiring). He says he needs to get to Kite and Yuma remembers  Dextra  falling to  Vetrix  for Kite's sake. Yuma says he has something to tell Kite and tells Orbital to lead them to him. Orbital agrees.
 
       " Tannhauser Gate " makes " Planet Pathfinder " and " Solar Wind Jammer "  Level  9.     
 Kite and Quinton have arrived at the Space Field and both appear on the flat surface of the space station's roof. Quinton says he knew the day where they would fight would come. Quinton remembers watching  Hart  and thinks the day he found out the truth, his heart became surrounded by hatred and revenge. Kite says he will make Quinton pay for hurting Hart. They begin the  Duel , with Quinton saying he'll take the first  turn . He  Normal Summons  " Planet Pathfinder " and  Special Summons  " Solar Wind Jammer " from his  hand  via its own  effect  by halving its  ATK . He  activates  " Tannhauser Gate " and explains that it lets him change the  Levels  of two his monsters to their combined total. He changes the Level 4 "Planet Pathfinder" and the Level 5 "Solar Wind Jammer" to Level 9. Kite says he has two Level 9 monsters. Quinton  overlays  them to  Xyz Summon  " Number 9: Dyson Sphere " in  Attack Position . The monster fails to appear though and Kite asks where it is. Quinton ignores him and explains the effect of the Duel Field, " Space Field ". When a player Xyz Summons, they  draw a card . Quinton  Sets  a card and ends his turn, with Kite again questioning where his monster is. 
 
       " Photon Delta Wing " is Summoned.     
 Quinton asks him what's wrong and tells him it's his turn. Kite thinks that even if the monster can't be seen, its still there as a Summon was declared. He Normal Summons " Photon Delta Wing ". He orders it to  attack  with  "Photon Missile" . The missiles miss Quinton and are absorbed by a  black hole  behind him. Quinton apologizes, saying his attacks can't reach him. He asks if that will be all and begins his turn. 
 Quinton orders "Dyson Sphere" to attack "Delta Wing". A  white hole  appears behind him, which blasts "Delta Wing" with spears of light,  destroying  it and bringing Kite down to 3000  Life Points . Kite asks what's going on here and Quinton says he knew Kite wouldn't understand - Quinton's Dueling has gone far beyond his imagination. Yuma's Duel Coaster appears in the air and Tori asks if this is the Space Field, which Astral confirms. Orbital says he's confirmed the signal from Kite's  D-Pad  and they fly towards the space station. Tori asks why he's speeding up and Yuma says the coaster's controls aren't responding to him. They crash between Kite and Quinton, with Tori calling Yuma an idiot and Orbital asking Kite if he's alright. 
 
         Yuma  angry at Kite for showing no concern for  Dextra .     
 Yuma gets up and says he has something he needs to tell Kite. He explains that Dextra was defeated by Vetrix. Kite's eyes widen and Yuma continues that Dextra fought Vetrix for him. Kite responds that he doesn't care. Yuma grabs Kite by the collar and Quinton calls out to Yuma. He calls him  Kazuma 's son and says that everyone has now gathered here - it must be fate. Yuma says he has something to ask Quinton - where is his father? Quinton says he'll tell them everything he knows before they continue the Duel. Kite says he has no time to listen to such a story and asks to continue their Duel. Quinton says the story is relevant to him too and that the Duel can wait. He asks if Kite didn't wonder why  Quinton's family  suddenly appeared in the  World Duel Carnival , why they targeted Hart and why they were trying to take revenge against their father -  Dr. Faker . Yuma is surprised to hear that Faker is Kite's father and wishes to know why they want revenge. 
 Quinton explains that five years earlier, Kite's father, Faker, and Quinton's own father,  Byron Arclight , were conducting research about opening the doorway to other dimensions. They worked from  Heartland Tower . Faker says they found dimensional distortions all around the world, but he can't pinpoint their exact location. He angrily slams his hands onto his keyboard. Byron appears behind him with a drink and tells him drink it and calm down a bit. Faker turns and knocks the drink from Byron's hands, with the mug falling to the floor and shattering. He says he has no time to do that - he must find the door to the other dimensions. Byron tells him there is one other person attempting to find that doorway. Quinton is standing at another console and he tells him to bring up that person's image, calling Quinton "Chris". Byron says he's an interesting man - an adventurer named Kazuma Tsukumo. Kazuma sits on a rock in the desert, watching the sunset. He says it's peaceful and that no one should bother him here. A helicopter appears overhead and he guesses he was wrong. 
 
         Kazuma Tsukumo  arrives after being found by  Chris .     
 Kazuma enters Heartland Tower with Chris and complements the amazing equipment they have. Byron thanks him for coming so quickly and shakes his hand, introducing himself as Byron Arclight. Kazuma says they have a gravity wave map and an electromagnetic wave map, both very impressive. Faker yells he has no time to be flattered - he analyzed all the distortions and still can't find it - something has to be missing. Byron asks for Kazuma's opinion about the door's location. Kazuma steps forward and says finding the door will change mankind's history and make those that discover it rich and famous. Faker says he has no need for either of those things, he simply must find the door. Kazuma smiles and says he feels relieved to hear that. Kazuma says what interests him about the door is its potential for a real adventure. Byron asks if that was a test, then. Faker tells Kazuma to look at the electromagnetic wave map. He explains that after the appearance of the doorway, he found odd phenomenons in twenty-one places around the world. He says he was positive he could determine the next place the door would appear if he analyzed those places. Kazuma calls it the twenty-first dimensional equation and Faker says there is only one more step. Kazuma says he's missing something. Faker says that's impossible, but Kazuma clarifies that there are not only twenty-one locations. He says that by just sitting around in a lab, they've missed some things. He reveals there are twenty-three locations, meaning there are two more. Kazuma says the true answer is the twenty-third dimensional equation.
 Quinton says that by analyzing that new data, they pinpointed the location and headed there. Faker tells the rest to stay behind, just he, Byron and Kazuma will go. Byron tells Chris it will be fine. In the present, Quinton says that what he saw ends there. From here on is the story his father told him. Guided by Kazuma, they climbed down into the valley. While making camp one night, Byron asks if they'll really make it and Kazuma responds by explaining " kattobingu ". He shows Byron a picture of his family. Kazuma says his son loves Dueling and Byron says his own son is the same way and says that he has three sons, also telling him that Faker has two. Kazuma asks just what is it that Faker is after. Byron says he doesn't know, but he does know that Faker is a true genius. He says that no matter what the reason is, he wants to help with Faker's work. Kazuma says that Faker must be happy to have a friend like him. In his tent, Faker types on his console. He translates some runes and reads them saying that "by offering two souls, a great doorway will appear" (in the dub, he says "Deliver two souls for mysteries untold"). He smiles. Q
 
         Dr. Faker ,  Byron Arclight  and Kazuma Tsukumo venture to find the door to other dimensions.     
 Quinton explains that after three days, they finally arrived. Byron asks if its ruins of an ancient civilization and Faker sees three markings on the ground. He says this is the place for sure. He steps on a floor slab with an inscription on it. The inscription glows red and the door slams shut. A giant slab falls from the ceiling. Kazuma jumps, pushing Faker out of the way in time. Kazuma tells Byron not to move and says that traps must have been set to deter intruders. Later, they descend some stairs, with Kazuma saying that up to now has been child's play. They must use all of their bravery and knowledge from this point on. Byron asks if Faker is alright, with Faker saying he's fine. He lags behind the other two a bit though. 
 
         Faker sacrifices Byron and Kazuma.     
 Bryon and Kazuma reach the very top of a set of stairs, which just leads to the top of a pillar. Kazuma says its a dead-end, but there must be something here. The runes below them glow red and electricity pulses through their bodies as they turn red as well. Below them, Faker says that the moment has come. He says he feels sorry for them and Byron asks what's he's doing. Faker explains that the runes below them say "by offering two souls, a great door will appear ("Deliver two souls for mysteries untold" in the dub). Byron asks if he's trying to use them as sacrifices and Faker says he must find the door at any cost.  Kazuma asks if Byron wasn't his friend. Faker says that friends are useless. The stairs collapse and Faker says that if Byron is his friend, he should be happy to to be sacrificed and that it's the best an average person like him could hope for. The pillar collapses and they fall towards a portal. Kazuma barely hangs on and grabs Byron's hand, yelling "kattobingu". Byron tells him to let go of him, as if he doesn't, Kazuma will fall too. Kazuma says he's heard it said that if Duel someone, you become friends - and to him adventuring is his Dueling. Faker tells them to disappear and the piece of rock that Kazuma is hanging on to falls. They both fall towards the portal, with Byron yelling he won't forget this. 
 
         Byron Arclight  returns.     
 In the present, Yuma says that was his father's last adventure then. Astral compares the sacrifice to Xyz Summoning. Quinton says his own father returned though. He has wandered through the other world, with only revenge on his mind. Because of that, he had changed. His father is currently known as  Vetrix . Everyone is surprised. Quinton says that the true culprit is Faker - and Quinton will make him pay. Kite says he has only Hart, he has no interest in what Faker does. He says they'll continue the Duel now and tells Yuma to move out of the way. Kite Special Summons " Photon Thrasher " in Attack Position, explaining he can do so when he  controls  no  monsters . He Normal Summons " Photon Pirate " and explains that it can  banish  a " Photon " monster in his  Graveyard  to increase its ATK by 1000 until the  End Phase . He banishes "Delta Wing" to increase the ATK of "Pirate" to 2000. Quinton says there are two monsters with 2000 or more ATK and Yuma says Kite's  ace card  is coming. 
 Kite  Tributes  "Thrasher" and "Pirate" to  Tribute Summon  " Galaxy-Eyes Photon Dragon " in Attack Position. Kite remembers that last turn, he took 1000 damage when his "Delta Wing" was destroyed by battle with Quinton's "Dyson Sphere". So that means that Quinton's "Number 9" must have 2800 ATK, since "Delta Wing" had 1800 ATK (1800 ATK on "Delta Wing" + 1000 Battle Damage = 2800 ATK on "Dyson Sphere"). He tells "Galaxy-Eyes" to attack with  "Photon Stream of Destruction" , but Quinton says he's foolish. The blast goes through Quinton and he takes no damage. He says he'll show Kite his "Number" now. Bright light streams out from the sun, blinding everyone. A black object appears from behind the sun, which is quickly engulfed by a tube in the center of the object. Two small satellites float around it. Quinton says its the gigantic monster that even consumes the sun - "Number 9: Dyson Sphere". Quinton claims that no matter what the monster is, "Dyson Sphere" cannot be defeated.
 
 Featured Duel: Kite Tenjo vs. Quinton 
         Kite Tenjo  vs.  Quinton .     
 This  Duel  takes place at a  Duel Field , " Space Field ". It is a treated as a  face-up   Field Spell Card . Its  effect  allows players to  draw a card  each time they perform an  Xyz Summon . The  Duelists  begin with the amount of  Life Points  they had at the end of the  Duel Coaster .

                 No. 9 Canopy Star - Dyson Sphere   " Number 9: Dyson Sphere " is Summoned.     Quinton  draws " Planet Pathfinder " and subsequently Normal Summons it ( 4/1000/1000) in Attack Position. He then  Special Summons  " Solar Wind Jammer " from his hand in  Attack Position  via its own effect by halving its  original ATK  ( 5/800 → 400/2400). Quinton  activates  " Tannhauser Gate " to target both his monsters and change their  Levels  to the sum of their original Levels ("Planet Pathfinder":   4 → 9; "Solar Wind Jammer":   5 → 9). He then  overlays  "Planet Pathfinder" and "Solar Wind Jammer" in order to Xyz Summon " Number 9: Dyson Sphere " ( 9/2800/3000, ORU: 2) in Attack Position, though its form and stats are hidden from Kite at this point. As Quinton Xyz Summoned, he draws a card via the effect of "Space Field". Quinton  Sets  a card.
 Turn 2: Kite 
 Kite  draws. He then Normal Summons " Photon Delta Wing " ( 4/1800/900) in Attack Position. "Photon Delta Wing"  attacks  "Dyson Sphere", but Quinton activates the second effect of "Dyson Sphere" to  negate  the attack. 
 Turn 3: Quinton

Kite activates the effect of "Photon Pirate" to banish "Photon Delta Wing" and increase the  ATK  of "Photon Pirate" by 1000 until the  End Phase  ("Photon Pirate": 1000 → 2000 ATK). Kite  Tributes  "Photon Thrasher" and "Photon Pirate" in order to Special Summon " Galaxy-Eyes Photon Dragon " ( 8/3000/2500) from his hand in Attack Position via its own effect (as the Tributed monsters had at least 2000 ATK).
