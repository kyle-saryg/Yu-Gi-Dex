 The shocking sequel to "Yu-Gi-Oh!: Duelist" and prequel to "Yu-Gi-Oh!: Millennium World!" When the follower of an old enemy returns to take revenge, Yugi Mutou must duel to save a friend's life. But can he overcome the power of the three "Jashin," the terrifying Evil God Cards? [1] 
 A Wicked Shadow! 
 It's been many duels since Yugi defeated Maxmillion Pegasus, the super-rich designer of the collectible card game "Duel Monsters." But Yako Tenma, Pegasus' protégé, has never forgiven Yugi for his master's horrible fate. To draw Yugi out, Yako kidnaps Anzu Mazaki and takes her to the heart of the KaibaCorp building, guarded by dozens of the world's most dangerous gamers! But Yako's true plan for Anzu is much worse than mere revenge… [2]

 Ito-kun was one of my assistants who worked on "Yu-Gi-Oh!", and now he's going to write a brand new "Yu-Gi-Oh!! series. I'll be looking forward to every episode. Enjoy everyone! [2] 
 
 Message from Akira Ito 
 Kazuki Takahashi sensei's "Yu-Gi-Oh!" has come to an end, and now there's no more new chapters for us to read. "Yu-Gi-Oh! R" focuses on things that we couldn't include in the original series. I hope you like it! [2]

 Story 
 When the tenth grader Yugi solved the ancient Egyptian Millennium Puzzle, another spirit took up residence in his body…Yu-Gi-Oh, the King of Games! Using his gaming skills, Yugi fought many ruthless enemies at "Duel Monsters," the most popular collectible card game in the world. Eventually, Yugi's skills got the attention of Maximillion Pegasus, the game's multimillionaire creator…and the bearer of another Egyptian artifact, the Millennium Eye. Using his strange powers, Pegasus stole the soul of Yugi's grandfather and forced Yugi to participate in "Duelist Kingdom," a tournament on a remote island. After many tough battles, Yugi beat Pegasus and rescued his grandfather's soul. After the battle, Pegasus suffered a terrible fate. 
 But Yugi's other great rival, Seto Kaiba, the teenage CEO of Kaiba Corporation, was not so easily defeated. Discovering that Pegasus had created three incredibly rare cards known as the "Egyptian God Cards," Kaiba announced a new tournament, "Battle City," to draw out the owners so he could get the cards for himself. But Yugi won the tournament and acquired the most powerful cards in the world: "Slifer the Sky Dragon," "The God of the Obelisk" and "The Sun Dragon Ra". Within the cards dwells a mystic power which is linked to Yu-Gi-Oh's Egyptian past. But now, an new enemy has appeared… [2] 
 
 In the Next Volume… 
 What is the truth behind the mysterious "R.A Project"? To find out, Yugi must face the terrifying power of the Three Evil Gods! But while Yugi fights for his friend's life, another duelist races across the Atlantic Ocean to join in the battle. Kaiba is back, but whose side will he be on?
