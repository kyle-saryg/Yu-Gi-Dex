 " Advanced Dark " itself helps to minimize any battle damage you take while you control " Advanced Crystal Beast " monsters, allowing for consistent swarming of this card and other "Advanced Crystal Beast" monsters via " Advanced Crystal Beast Ruby Carbuncle ". 
 Equipping this card with " Rod of the Mind's Eye " allows it to consistently inflict more battle damage from its direct attack.
 You can instead equip "Rod of the Mind's Eye" to "Advanced Crystal Beast Ruby Carbuncle" or " Advanced Crystal Beast Emerald Tortoise " if you control either of them alongside this card.
