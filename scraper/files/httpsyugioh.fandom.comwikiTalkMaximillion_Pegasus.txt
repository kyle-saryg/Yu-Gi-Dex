 Umm, which episode does Pegasus appear in GX?  J0V1  12:50, 22 May 2008 (UTC)
 
 The Winged Dragon of Ra one is  episode 85 . 
 The time he duelled Crowler and Bontaparte was  episode 092 
 The time he mentioned his top 5 duellists, I think was  episode 106 
 And meh a few more.

 Age? 
 Is Pegasus really only 24 years old in the first show?  I thought he was much older than that!  There must be some kind of mistake, here.

 During Duelist Kingdom in the manga, it gave profiles on a few of the competitors and Pegasus himself. It gave Pegasus' age there, it being 24. --  Deltaneos  ( talk ) 00:26, 27 February 2009 (UTC) 
 What does the j stand for?
 
-I guess if Pegasus was in Yugioh 5ds he would maybe 51 years old. He would still have gray hair.:)
also, anyone in anime is usually young lol  Darthdj31  03:32, November 26, 2009 (UTC)
 
 In the anime he would be 51 in the manga he is dead -- KiumaruHamachi  22:15, January 18, 2010 (UTC)KiumaruHamachi 
 About his Manga death 
 In which Bunkobon afterward does it state that Pegasus went to heaven after his death? And could I see a translation of those parts?  Mrzisawesome  ( talk  •  contribs ) 15:02, July 10, 2011 (UTC)
 
 I don't know, but the original source of that edit was  this wiki . It seems reliable, but wikis aren't very good as primary sources. --  Deltaneos  ( talk ) 10:52, July 24, 2011 (UTC) 
 Also, when I read Yu-Gi-Oh! R Manga 5, they showed us that Pegasus turned around and walked away, not look back when he "entered" the Light. That can referring that Pegasus confirmed to give his life and went to Heaven. -- F r e d C a t  11:47, July 24, 2011 (UTC) 
 Was that in R volume 5 or chapter 5? I can't find that scene in volume 5.  Mrzisawesome  ( talk  •  contribs ) 01:05, January 6, 2012 (UTC) 
 Canonical 
 Why isn´´t Yu-Gi-Oh R! listed under non-canonical?-- 77.13.152.190  ( talk ) 00:02, January 6, 2012 (UTC)
 
 I think it is canonical, since Takahashi came up with the concept and supervised it. Besides, it fits in perfectly after Battle City.  Mrzisawesome  ( talk  •  contribs ) 01:06, January 6, 2012 (UTC) 
 Anime age 
 In episode 40, Pegasus said that he met Cyndia 14 years before Duelist Kingdom and that she died shortly after Pegasus turned 17. So he can't be older than 31. Since he and Cyndia look much older in the funeral scene than the scene where they met, he would have to be a few years younger than 31.
 In episode 165,  Duel Monsters  existed in a flashback from 12 years earlier. I think the non-flashback portion of that episode is set less than a year after Duelist Kingdom.  Duel Monsters  didn't exist until months after Cyndia died. That would make Pegasus at least 17 + a few months + 12 - a few months = at least 29 (28 at a stretch). Although he looks younger than 15 in the scene where he met Cyndia.
 I'm guessing at the time episode 40 was written, they intended to use the same dates as the manga, making him 10 when he met Cyndia and 24 in Duelist Kingdom. The 12-year flashback either changed that or is a plot hole.
 I don't think "he doesn't look 24" is a valid argument. If that were the case, he couldn't be 24 in the manga either. For the record, his manga age has been stated in:
 
 Yu-Gi-Oh! Duelist  Duel 18: " On My Own " 
 Yu-Gi-Oh! Duelist  Duel 73: " The Tragic Tale of the Millennium Eye "  (not stated but it can be calculated) 
 Yu-Gi-Oh! Character Guidebook: The Gospel of Truth  page 56 
 Yu-Gi-Oh! Character Guidebook: Millennium Book  page 112

 Yeah, also read something similar to what you said in  another place ; that is age is between 24 and 31. But it seems we can't draw a precise conclusion, I suppose. Should we point his age as "between 24 and 31" or something?  Becasita   Pendulum   ( talk  •  contribs )  21:25, July 2, 2016 (UTC) 
 That site has the extra detail that Pegasus acquired the Millennium Eye 7 years before the preset day events. That would make him 17 + time between Cyndia's death and him getting the eye + 7. From his dialogue,  "For months I stared at the blank canvas of my heart. At that time I heard about how according to Ancient Egyptian belief, souls lived on after death. Perhaps I could meet Cyndia if I used the technique handed down in Ancient Egypt." , my interpretation is that he spent months mourning her death, during which he learned about the Egyptian beliefs and after which he acted on what he learned, meaning he's 24 and a few months. But where in the anime, does it say that it's seven years since Pegasus got the Millennium Eye? --  Deltaneos  ( talk ) 22:14, July 2, 2016 (UTC) 
 Hum, I have no idea. Only watched the dub and last time was years ago. Would have to re-watch those parts where he talks about his past.  Becasita   Pendulum   ( talk  •  contribs )  22:32, July 2, 2016 (UTC)
