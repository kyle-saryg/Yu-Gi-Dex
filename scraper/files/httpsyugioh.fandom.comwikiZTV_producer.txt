 The  ZTV producer  (ＺＴＶプロデューサー  Zetto Tī Vi purodyūsā ) is a character appearing in the  Yu-Gi-Oh!  manga .
 He is portrayed as a selfish corrupt executive of the television studio,  ZTV . He takes advantage of underprivileged people to boost ratings and cheats his way out of giving away prize money. [1] 
 
 Biography 
 He was a producer of the TV game show,  The Get the Million Game . He was pleased to find out that  Katsuya Jonouchi , who was poor and trying to pay off his father's gambling debts, would be on the show. He thought the audience would love to see a poor person struggling and love it even more to see him fail last minute. [1] 
 
       The producer's "Mind on Air"  Penalty Game .     
 He and a  technician  tried to rig the final stage of the game, to prevent Jonouchi winning the prize money. This was to be done by pressing a button, which would prevent the wheel in the final game from stopping on the ¥1,000,000 (about $10,000 U.S. at the time) section. The button was colored red to distinguish it from the other buttons on the switchboard. [1] 
 Yugi Mutou  overheard the producer and technician talking about their plans and switched to  Dark Yugi  and followed them backstage. The producer tried to shoo him away, but Yugi threatened to tell people that they had the game rigged if they didn't play a game with him. The producer told the technician to take the rope Yugi wanted them to take for the game. The technician and Dark Yugi each tied a rope to their arm and pulled with a 50-50 chance of pulling a bucket of paint on top of themself. The bucket landed on the technician's head. The producer worried about getting paint on his own suit, rather than his assistant's well being. With no time left, the producer went to press the button on the switchboard, but found the red paint from the bucket had splattered onto it, making the button indistinguishable from the others. Jonouchi went on to win the game. [1] 
 While the producer started to panic at losing ¥1,000,000, Dark Yugi placed a  Penalty Game , "Mind on Air", on the producer, which drove him insane, leading him to demand money on camera from the viewers while insulting them as lazy couch potatoes. Jonouchi's check turned worthless when the television studio went bankrupt from this debacle. [1]
