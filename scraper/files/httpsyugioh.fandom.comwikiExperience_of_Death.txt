 Events 
       The Experience of Death in Virtual Reality, inflicted on  Sugoroku Mutou     
 The Experience of Death was first executed by Dark Yugi to Kaiba, following Kaiba's theft of the " Blue-Eyes White Dragon " card and subsequent loss in  their game  of  Duel Monsters . This caused him to believe he was sent to the  Duel Monsters Spirit World , where he repeatedly suffered death at the hands of monsters. [1]  Although Kaiba recovered, he continued to suffer nightmares of the experience. [2] 
 Kaiba simulated the Penalty Game with his  Battle Boxes , which used Solid Vision to create realistic virtual reality projections of the monsters. He found that the average person was driven insane after ten minutes of exposure. [2] 
 Kaiba subjected  Sugoroku Mutou  to the Experience of Death, after defeating him in  a game  of  Duel Monsters  at the  Kaiba Land  opening. [2]  He ended the simulation in exchange for  Yugi Mutou 's agreement to participate in  Death-T . [3] 
 Following  Mokuba Kaiba 's defeat to  Dark Yugi , in  Death T-4 , Kaiba subjected Mokuba to the Experience of Death, despite being his brother. However, Mokuba was saved by Dark Yugi. [4]
