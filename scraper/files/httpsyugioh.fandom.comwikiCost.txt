 A  cost  (Japanese: コスト  Kosuto ) is an action that must be performed in order to activate a card or  effect , to perform another action, or to keep a card on the field. This is distinct from  activation conditions , which are requirements that must be met in order to activate a card or effect.
 As the name suggests, costs usually involve the player making a sacrifice of some type, such as  paying   Life Points  (e.g. " Seven Tools of the Bandit " requires the player to pay 1000 Life Points);  discarding ,  Tributing ,  banishing , or  detaching  a card(s) (e.g. " Cannon Soldier " requires 1 monster to be Tributed); or  sending  a card(s) to the  Graveyard  (e.g. " Hidden Armory " requires the top card of the  Deck  to be  sent  the  Graveyard ).
 If a cost cannot be fully paid (such as if an active effect prevents the cost from being paid, or the player cannot fulfill the requirements for the cost), none of the cost can be paid and the effect cannot be activated. For example, if a cost specifies that a card must be  sent  to the  Graveyard  while " Macro Cosmos " is on the field, the effect cannot be activated.
 Because costs are distinct from effects, if a card is moved to a different location due to a cost, cards and effects that can only be activated when the card is moved by a card effect cannot be activated. For example, the effect of " Shaddoll Dragon " cannot be activated if it is sent to the Graveyard as a cost to activate " Phoenix Wing Wind Blast ". Likewise, even if a card's effect is being negated (such as by " Skill Drain "), it is still possible to activate its effects (which would require paying the cost).

 Activation cost 
 An activation cost is a mandatory action that must be done to activate a card or effect, separated from the rest of the effect by a semicolon (or the word "to," / a comma / the word "then", in most cases without  PSCT ), which must be paid at the beginning of the effect's  activation . The cost itself is not activated, cannot be negated, and occurs at activation time not resolution time.
 When an effect features a cost, if the  timing  is correct (up to the colon), the cost is paid and any  targeting  is done (up to the semicolon for cards with  PSCT , and normally up to the word "to" / comma / "then" for cards without PSCT), then the activation is placed on the  Chain  (or starts a Chain if there is not a current Chain). After either the rest of the Chain resolves or both players decide not to Chain to the activation, the card or effect  resolves .
 If a cost starts with "You can...", the effect is optional and the cost is only paid if the player chooses to activate the effect. Even if the effect is mandatory, the effect cannot be activated if the cost cannot be paid, and no cost is paid if all of it cannot be.
 A cost is not an effect. As such, the cost is paid before the effect takes place, regardless of whether or not the effect is negated. If a monster's effect is negated as long as it's on the field, and its cost requires it, or the card affecting it, leaves the field, the monster can resolve its effect. For example, if " Stardust Dragon " or " Stardust Warrior " activates its effect while affected by " Skill Drain " or " Fiendish Chain ", because it is not on the field when it resolves (due to  Tributing  itself as a cost), its effect is not negated by "Skill Drain" or "Fiendish Chain". This was called Release Escape in the  Yu-Gi-Oh 5D's  anime. [1] 
 
 Costs from Continuous Effects 
 Cards such as " Chain Energy " and " Dark Panther " have  Continuous Effects  that impose a cost on performing certain optional actions, such as  declaring  an  attack  or  Summoning  monsters. If the player cannot pay the cost for the Continuous Effect, they cannot perform the action.
 
 Maintenance costs 
 Main article:  Maintenance cost 
 A maintenance cost is a cost required to keep a card on the field. These costs are typically paid during a player's  Standby  or  End Phase .
 
 Examples 
 Activation costs 
 Negation of "Seven Tools of the Bandit" 
 Step 1: Player A  activates  " Mirror Force ". 
 Step 2: Player B activates " Seven Tools of the Bandit " and  pays  1000  Life Points . 
 Step 3: Player A activates " Solemn Judgment " and pays half their Life Points. 
 Step 3  resolves : "Solemn Judgment"  negates  and  destroys  "Seven Tools of the Bandit". 
 Step 2 doesn't resolve because "Seven Tools of the Bandit" was negated. The Life Points paid when "Seven Tools of the Bandit" was activated are not refunded. 
 Step 1 resolves: The effect of "Mirror Force" resolves. 
 Negation of "Premature Burial" in a Chain 
 Step 1: Player A  activates  " Premature Burial " and  pays  800  Life Points , and then chooses the " Jinzo " in their  Graveyard  as the  target . 
 Step 2: Player B  chains  " Magic Jammer " and  discards  1 card from their  hand  to  negate  "Premature Burial". 
 Step 2  resolves : "Magic Jammer" negates the effect of "Premature Burial". 
 Step 1 does not resolve because "Premature Burial" was negated. No monster is  Special Summoned . The Life Points paid when "Premature Burial" was activated are not refunded. 
 Destruction of "Premature Burial" in a Chain 
 Step 1: Player A  activates  " Premature Burial " and pays 800 Life Points, and then chooses the " Jinzo " in their  Graveyard  as the  target . 
 Step 2: Player B activates " Mystical Space Typhoon " to  destroy  "Premature Burial". 
 Step 2  resolves : "Mystical Space Typhoon" destroys "Premature Burial". 
 Step 1 does not resolve because "Premature Burial" was destroyed; because it is an  Equip Spell Card , the card's effect relies on it continuing to be in play in order to activate. No monster is revived. The Life Points paid when "Premature Burial" was activated are not refunded. 
 Chaining "Mask of Restrict" to the effect of "Cannon Soldier" 
 Step 1: Player A  Tributes  a monster and  activates  the effect of their " Cannon Soldier " during their  Main Phase 2 . 
 Step 2: Player B activates " Mask of Restrict ",  chaining  it to the effect of "Cannon Soldier". 
 Step 2  resolves : "Mask of Restrict" is in play and prevents monsters from being  Tributed . 
 Step 1 resolves: The monster was already Tributed before "Mask of Restrict" was successfully resolved. Therefore the effect of "Cannon Soldier" resolves and Player B loses 500 Life Points. Because "Mask of Restrict" is active, further Tributes cannot take place.
