 Cannot be Special Summoned from... 
 A less limiting restriction than the one above. This allows cards to be Special Summoned from any place except the one or ones mentioned in the text. This restriction usually applies on the  Graveyard , and because you cannot Special Summon from it, you have no choose but to move those cards from the Graveyard by using cards like " Monster Reincarnation " or " Pot of Avarice " for example.

 Must first be Special Summoned... 
 This refers places a restriction on how the card must be  first   Special Summoned . The card cannot be Special Summoned by an external effect until the summoning condition has been properly fulfilled, after which, the monster in question may be Summoned with cards such as " Monster Reborn ". If the card was sent to the  Graveyard  before being Summoned correctly, it cannot be Special Summoned; likewise, if the card was Special Summoned correctly the first time, but is then sent from the field or the Graveyard back to the  hand ,  Deck  or  Extra Deck , the Summoning Conditions are then reset. These cards are referred to as  Special Summon-only monsters  or sometimes referred to as  Semi-Nomi  monsters.

 Must be Special Summoned... 
 This is much like the first example, but this time, it prevents the card from being  Special Summoned  by any effect other than the one on its effect, preventing it from being Special Summoned by cards such as " Monster Reborn ". " LV " monsters' support cards, such as " Level Modulation ", get around this by including  Ignoring its Summoning conditions  in their card text. However, even with this restriction lifted, such cards can only Special Summoned from the Graveyard if they have been properly Summoned first. " Level Up! " is able to bypass this completely, since it Special Summons directly from the Deck. These cards are referred to as  Nomi  monsters. Cards such as " Dark Armed Dragon " and " Destiny HERO - Plasma " are Nomi monsters and can only be Special Summoned with its Summoning Condition from the hand. " Stardust Dragon/Assault Mode " is also a Nomi monster and can only be Special Summoned from the Deck with " Assault Mode Activate ".
