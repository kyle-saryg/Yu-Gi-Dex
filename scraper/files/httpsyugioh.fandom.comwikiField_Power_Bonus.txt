      The  Duelist Kingdom island  featured numerous terrains, allowing for various Field Power Bonuses.     
 In the  Duelist Kingdom  arc of the anime and manga, each  Dueling Arena  had the properties of a specific type of land mass. If a monster was Summoned on a terrain it favored, it would receive a 30% increase in its  ATK  and  DEF . This was called a  Field Power Bonus . Unlike  Field Spell Cards , arenas sometimes had multiple types of field in play simultaneously, that could power up different monsters depending on which  Monster Card Zone  they were played on. In practice, this could be likened to having multiple  Field Spell Cards  in play. The following were seen:
 
 Ocean 
 Land 
 Meadow 
 Wilderness 
 Graveyard 
 Mountain 
 Forest 
 Desert 
 Night 
 DARK  Attribute monsters (when said cards are played at night) 
 The  Field Power Bonus  rule was also utilized in the  first series of the anime . However, it didn't appear to matter what side of the field you were sitting on when playing monsters on certain field squares.
 The second series anime made reference to monsters with the Field Power Bonus not being affected by attacks that used  Magic Cards  to power the monster up (such as " Feral Imp " equipped with " Horn of the Unicorn "). While Yugi Muto was explaining the Field Power Bonus, a series of lands appeared on screen, including an unseen "arctic" or snow-laden land. 
 Some video games, such as  Yu-Gi-Oh! The Duelists of the Roses  also utilizes the concept of Field Power Bonus. In the game, your  Monster  gains 500  ATK  and  DEF  if the Field it is on is favorable to it, but a monster whom the field is not favorable to loses 500 ATK and DEF. For Example: spaces with the Yami field favors  Fiend  and  Spellcaster -types, but not  Fairy  types.
