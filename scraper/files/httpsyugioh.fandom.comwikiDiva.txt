 Design 
 Appearance 
       Full body view of Aigami     
 Diva has tanned skin, golden eyes and dark teal hair that spikes outwards in the back, features two small spikes pointing upwards (in a manner similar to horns) and four ponytails (two short ones framing his face and two long ones in the back) bound with golden rings. Diva wears a sleeveless green trench coat that features a high collar and a black border outlined in orange that is patterned with black triangles that are also outlined in orange, a lavender long-sleeved shirt that reaches past his waist with the cuffs rolled back to form spikes at his elbows, a light green sash around his waist, tan pants, and simple brown boots tied at the cuff with tan laces. Diva also wears a large golden ankh-shaped adornment that is clipped onto the golden rings of his right bang, twin golden bracelets with curved designs engraved on them, and a pendant that resembles a miniature simplified  Millennium Puzzle . While in disguise as "Aigami", he wears the closed-coat variant of the  Domino High School  male uniform, and lacks his golden jewelry while doing so while wearing both his uniform and his normal clothes.
 
       Diva's face after being corrupted by the Millenium Ring     
 After he is corrupted by the evil remaining in the  Millennium Ring , Diva takes on a horrifyingly grotesque, demonic appearance. His skin becomes dark greenish-gray with numerous cube-like structures protruding all over his body - there are two different versions: the larger, more prominent ones, which are a sickly pinkish-purple color and feature black vein-like cracks, cover most of his body, as well as forms a rigid cube-like tail, and the smaller, less prominent ones, which are a dark gray/black color, appear in places like his hair, and even form a pair of rigid cube-like wings. His arms lengthen considerably while also gaining a single spike on the elbows and his fingertips elongate into talon-like claws. His legs become double-jointed (similar to those of a grasshopper) and also seem to feature a single spike; his feet become digitigrade (meaning he walks on his toes, with his heels constantly in the air) and feature large talon-like toenails. His hair turns white and becomes more unruly and unkempt, his teeth become yellow and sharper, his tongue becomes long and blue, and his ears become pointed. Most notably, the Millennium Ring becomes fused to his chest with pronounced blood vessels surrounding it. The cubes on his left arm function as an organic  Duel Disk , while his eyes can freely move about the sides of the ones protruding from his head.
 
 Personality 
 As a street orphan who was saved by  Shadi Shin . He held him very dear as a father figure, and closely followed his teachings and ideals of the Prana, which were eventually strongly twisted by revenge after Shadi was killed by Dark Bakura. Despite this, he did still hold his sister and Mani very closely to him, horrified when Mani is killed by the Millennium Ring.
 As Dark Diva, unlike his true self, who desires a world of peace without hatred, after being influenced by the Millenium Ring's evil, Diva is obsessed with creating a world of darkness and despair, and is notably quite sadistic, as he ruthlessly struck down his own sister, and relished the idea of using a Duel with Kaiba and Yugi to make them suffer slowly, rather than disintegrating them quickly like everyone else.
 
 Etymology 
 Aigami's name comes from the  Sanskrit  word आगामी (Aaigami) meaning "the forthcoming" or "the accumulating" when referring to the concept of  karma . [4]  This moniker is appropriate since it alludes to his upcoming plans related to  Prana . 
Aigami's real name Diva refers to the Sanskrit word  Deva  which are heavenly and divine beings in Dharmic religions such as Hinduism,  Jainism , and  Buddhism . Conversely, his name can be alluding to the  Ancient Iranian  words  Daeva  or  Dev  which refers to evil deities and monstrous beings. It is believed that the word Dev in the  Proto-Indo-Iranian language  meant deity, however a schism created a divide in the meaning. This seems to be appropriate for the character as he believes to have a rightous cause, however harbors a corrupted side.
 
 Voice and Mannerisms 
 In the English dub, Diva speaks with a deep baritone voice that carries an air of sophistication to it, and often talks down to others due to him being chosen by the Prana.
 
As Dark Diva though, he speaks in a much deeper and more demonic tone of voice that has a very stuffy and nasally-type sound to it, and frequently laughs while declaring his opponents' efforts to be futile while also declaring his intentions to create a world of darkness and despair. 
 Biography 
 Childhood 
 Aigami, his sister,  Sera ,  Mani , and other orphans once lived with a  slave merchant . They got to sleep in his house, but would have to beg on the streets for money, which the merchant would keep for himself. If he was not satisfied with the amount they brought back, he would scold and refuse to feed them. [5] 
 After Diva and Sera returned an unsatisfactory amount of money, they were scolded by the slave merchant and apologized to the other children for costing them a meal. Mani insisted it was not their fault and that no matter how much they brought back the slave merchant would say it was not enough. He offered them a pillow, saying hugging it almost feels like having a big meal. After hearing the group laughing, the merchant entered the room and angrily grabbed Diva, demanding to know what was funny. [5] 
 Shadi Shin  arrived, declared that he was freeing the children and immobilized the slave merchant. He pushed on the children's heads, making gold symbols momentarily appear, then teleported each child away, before using the  Quantum Cube  to make the slave merchant disappear. [5] 
 
       Diva and his friends, under  Shadi 's care     
 Aigami and the other orphans then began to live in Egypt.  Shadi  played a mentor-like role in their lives and taught them about the  Millennium Items . In the  Shrine of the Underworld , he informed them that three of the items were weak to evil, three represented justice and the seventh, the  Millennium Puzzle , contained both justice and evil. He considered Aigami to be of the same level as the person destined to solve the Millennium Puzzle. Shadi told them that when the seven items are gathered, the door to a better world would be opened and that the three of them could enter this world, because they had been chosen. [5] 
 Bakura's father  entered the shrine, while Shadi was teaching Aigami, Sera and Mani about the Items. He offered to buy the  Millennium Ring , but Shadi instead got the ring to test him. The event led to Bakura's son,  Ryo Bakura , coming into contact with the ring, awaking  Dark Bakura , who attacked Shadi. Aigami, Sera and Mani rushed to Shadi, who handed him the  Quantum Cube , before he died. [5] 
 Aigami, Sera and Mani resided with a group of children, on a plateau above the clouds. Aigami decided to leave one day and went with a group of children. Mani also left to keep an eye on him. [5] 
 
 Transcend Game 
         Aigami returns  Tomo 's balloon.     
 Following  Seto Kaiba  overcoming  Sera 's obstacle in an attempted ascension to the netherworld, Aigami approached Sera. He remarked that Sera had been very close and that Kaiba was not somebody they could easily eliminate. While speaking to her, he retrieved a balloon  Tomo  had let float away and returned it to him. [6] 
 
 Harassed by Scud's gang 
 Worried about the possibility of  Seto Kaiba  finding the  Millenium Puzzle  in his excavation of the Ceremonial Chamber, Aigami sent  Mani  to infiltrate the excavation team to keep track of their progress. If found, they simply needed to banish whoever was there and hide the puzzle away.
 Just in case this failed, Aigami decided that the next best thing to ensure the Pharaoh couldn't return was to eliminate his vessel; however, unknown to Aigami, Yugi had no intention of ever using the puzzle again as he knew full well that Atem's spirit was no longer within it. Aigami altered the memories of people of  Domino City , implanting the notion that he had been a new student at  Domino High School . When  Yugi Mutou ,  Anzu Mazaki ,  Katsuya Jonouchi , and  Ryo Bakura  saw him at school, they were convinced that they knew him from before, but struggled to remember his name, before Honda finally said it was Aigami. [5] 
 
         Scud , filming Aigami     
 Scud  and his gang approached Aigami under a bridge. Scud approached him with a camera, while making provocative remarks about his cute face. (In the English dub, Scud said that Aigami was to star in his new documentary on bullying.) Aigami made pleas for the stop, which proved fruitless.  Katsuya Jonouchi  then jumped down from the bridge and intervened. Scud decided to drop the matter for the time being, but instructed Aigami to meet the gang at the the abandoned factory in District 3 at midnight. Jonouchi, Anzu and Yugi asked if Aigami was okay and Jonouchi offered to help, if Scud's gang were still giving him trouble. Aigami thanked them and insisted he was okay. After Aigami left, Jonouchi was puzzled by how he had no recollection of when Aigami joined their class. [5] 
 Per Scud's orders, Aigami met the gang at midnight. The gang brought lights and weapons. Scud continued to film, saying he would make Aigami world famous and that the theme of this video would be pain. (In the dub, he said that this is the part where Aigami cries and not due to an onion.) The gang were surprised to see Aigami laughing too. Aigami asked if he resided in their memories and who they thought was allowing scum like them to exist. (In the dub, he said it was time for them to vanish and that he had the power to change their world into some place grand, where they do not deserve to exist.) He produced the  Quantum Cube  and the bulbs in the lights the gang brought all blew. Numerous children of the  Prana  appeared in spirit form and surrounded the gang. Aigami used the cube in conjunction with the collective consciousness to make Scud's body disappear. (In the dub, one of the gangsters said that Scud was history, but Aigami disagreed, commenting that history is remembered.) He then made the other members of the gang disappear too. Before leaving, he picked up their camcorder. [5] 
 
 Millennium Puzzle excavation 
 Aigami teleported to  a mall , where he watched over Yugi and his friends. He watched bitterly as Bakura had a good time with his friends, remembering  Dark Bakura . He was interrupted by  Mani , who tried to dissuade him from attempting to harm Bakura, as they both knew the  Millennium Ring  was a source of evil that could have forced Bakura's horrible actions. However, Aigami firmly believed that the Ring wasn't responsible for Shadi's death, and that Bakura truly was an evil person. At that moment, Mani informed him that  Seto Kaiba  had found the Millennium Puzzle. [5] 
 
         Diva Duels  Kaiba .     
 Aigami teleported to the  Mortuary Temple , where Kaiba was excavating the Millennium Puzzle. Kaiba was aware Aigami was present in the crowd and that he was after the Millennium Puzzle. Kaiba called Aigami out by the name "Diva" and a KaibaCorp employee threatened him with a gun, an act which Diva mocked, before using the Quantum Cube to make the gunman disappear. Aigami proceeded to explain to Kaiba that the gunman had disappeared through the power of collective consciousness, that everything that occours in the world is registered in people's collective awareness. Because the Plana's wave patters outnumbered the collective consciousness of humanity by a factor of seven, their perceptions allowed them to teleport the gunman to a different dimension. He then unsuccessfully attempted to use the cube on Kaiba, whose latest  Duel Disk  technology was able to counter the Cube's power through the amplification of his own ego, allowing for the Plana's collective consciousness to be repelled. The two faced each other in a Duel instead. [5] 
 Diva seemed to take the advantage in the Duel. However, Kaiba pulled the card, " Obelisk the Tormentor ", straight out of the ground and Summoned it. Diva thought that this was impossible, since "Obelisk" was  the pharaoh 's card. Kaiba then used the effect of "Obelisk" and was on the verge of defeating Aigami, before leaving the Duel as Mokuba had prepared an escape. [5] 
 Once the KaibaCorp computer finished scanning the Millennium Puzzle pieces, Mokuba mounted the glass case containing the pieces onto a helicopter and taunted Aigami. Aigami teleported himself onto the case and stuck his hand through the glass. Mokuba saw what he was doing and headbutted him away, but Aigami managed to secretly take two pieces of the puzzle. [5] 
 While observing Yugi, who was rehearsing his graduation speech, Diva was approached by Sera, who asked if he had faced Kaiba. He handed her one of the puzzle pieces and instructed her to keep it safe. He also stated that he could kill Yugi as insurance that the  plana  remains theirs, which Sera was less enthusiastic about. [5] 
 
 Befriending Yugi's group 
 Aigami later spoke with Yugi, Jonouchi, Anzu, Honda and Bakura, claiming to be interested in getting to know them better, so the group went bowling and ate at a fast food restaurant. They discussed  Duel Monsters  and told Aigami about some of their adventures. [5] 
 
         Aigami pressures  Bakura  to talk about his time in Egypt.     
 Later, Jonouchi and Bakura headed to  Kame Game  to play  Duel Monsters  with Yugi. On the way, he showed them the Quantum Cube, but claimed it was just a Deck case. After Bakura brought up the topic of the  Millennium Ring , Diva used the cube to transport the three of them somewhere else. [5] 
 When Jonouchi asked what was going on, Diva used the cube to send Jonouchi to another dimension, which was slowly dissolving into oblivion. Diva appeared in the sky in that dimension and taunted Jonouchi, saying he was worthless and could not escape. [5] 
 Diva approached Bakura and asked if he did not remember their earlier meeting and showed him a vision of the event, where Dark Bakura killed Shadi. Bakura was shocked and wept. He pleaded that it was the ring's doing and apologized for taking away someone special to Diva. They were interrupted by Mani, who had became corrupted by the evil of the Millennium Ring and attempted to kill Bakura. However, Mani regained control of himself, threw Bakura aside and told Diva to run. Bakura was sent to one dimension, while Diva and Mani were sent to another, where Mani died and disappeared. Diva considered picking up the Millennium Ring, but stopped when he heard Yugi calling for Jonouchi. [5] 
 At the  Domino City Plaza  Aigami reveals to Yugi that he is a Prana whose real name is "Diva", and that the "Aigami" Yugi knew was merely an illusion, implanted in his memory. [5] 
 
 Duel Disk exhibition 
         Diva, abducted by the  KaibaCorp special forces     
 Diva is abducted and blindfolded by a group of men from KaibaCorp. He is brought before Kaiba, who demands the pieces of the puzzle. After refusing to hand them over, he is taken to  Kaiba Land . [5] 
 Diva wakes up tied to a chair in a glass prison, with Mokuba on the other side of the glass. Kaiba monitors their interaction externally. Diva taunts Mokuba, who affirms that Kaiba will never get both pieces. However, Mokuba claims to already know where the other piece is. [5] 
 At Kaiba Land, Kaiba introduces Yugi and Aigami and declares that he'll be Dueling each of them for the ownership of the remaining pieces of the Millennium Puzzle. Sera also appears and apologizes to Diva. Yugi declares that he'll be Dueling Diva first instead. [5] 
 Yugi and Diva begin to  Duel . After reducing Yugi to just a few Life Points, Diva claims he is not doing anything wrong; he just wishes to go the new dimension and leave the current corrupt world behind to create a new world. He invites Yugi to join him, but Yugi refuses to give up on the current world and its future. Yugi turns the Duel in his favor and defeats Diva, reiterating that he believes in the future. Diva disappears after the Duel, returning Bakura to the normal world. [5] 
 
         Diva, distorted by the  Millennium Ring     
 Diva then appears in the same dimension Mani died in, and finds the Millennium Ring there. Without touching it, he gets engulfed in its evil. He is then transformed into a monstrous being, with the ring fused with his chest. Diva then returns and Duels Yugi and Kaiba.  Atem  then comes back from the afterlife and defeats Diva, reverting his body back to his previous state. With Atem's revival, Diva and the other kids all lost their plana.
 He and Sera then part ways with Mani, who was revived, on good terms. [5] 
 
 Deck 
 Aigami uses a  " Cubic " Deck , which is largely focused on continuously Summoning and "leveling up" his "Cubic" monsters from their base form, " Vijam the Cubic Seed ", and using their effects to overpower his opponent within the space of a single turn.

 Trivia 
 While in the original Japanese version, Diva remains himself despite the changes to his body and personality, in the US dub it is unsure whether his post-transformation self is intended to be Diva, with a distorted personality, or a completely different character, much like Dark Bakura. The way he talks contains elements that suggest that he is still Diva (eg. "Yes, it's me, dear sister." upon Sera asking "Diva, is that you?", or "And now, at long last, sister, I will bring forth a perfect, new world! The one we've been dreaming of!"), but some other things he says makes it seem as if he could be a different entity entirely (eg. "Diva? Diva is no longer in control. I am! His fear invited me into his soul! He has saved me!" after Sera asks "Diva, what are you doing?"). It's unclear whether this ambiguity is intentional or not.
