 Having learned about  Ai 's sorrow,  Playmaker  tries to convince him to stop the battle. However, Ai has already made up his mind, and won't back down no matter what. As the two's battle continues to rage on, Ai makes a proposal to Playmaker.
 
 Featured Duel: Playmaker vs. Ai 
 Duel continues from the previous episode . 
 Turn 5: Playmaker 
" Cyberse Quantum Dragon " have just attacked Ai's " The Arrival Cyberse @Ignister ". The attack fails and "Quantum" is destroyed, but Playmaker takes no damage since the effect of " Exslayer " makes all  Battle Damage  involving monsters it points to 0. The effect of " Darkwight @Ignister " activates; inflicting 500 damage to Playmaker since one of his monsters were destroyed (Playmaker 3475 → 2975 LP).  Playmaker   sets  a card and ends his turn.
 Turn 6: Ai 
The effect of "The Arrival" activates, destroying "Exslayer" to summon an " @Ignister Token ". However, Playmaker activates the effect of " Cyberse Synchron " from his  GY ; banishing itself to prevent "Exslayer"'s destruction. "The Arrival" attacks " Firewall eXceed Dragon ". "eXceed Dragon" is destroyed and but "Exslayer"'s effect makes the  Battle Damage  0. The effect of "Darkwight" activates; Playmaker takes 500 damage (Playmaker 2975 → 2475 LP). 
 Turn 7: Playmaker 
He uses "Exslayer" to  Link Summon  " Linkross " (900/LINK-1/↓). Then, the effect of "Lincross" allows him to summon 2 " Link Tokens " (equal to the Link Rating of its Link Material). Playmaker summons " Metal Molephosis " (1000/1000) and activates his effect, declare an Attribute and a Type, and make all Normal Monsters he currently controls so. changing his "Link Tokens" to  DARK   Dragons . He then uses "Metal Molephosis" and LINK-1 "Linkross" to Link Summons " Proxy F Magician " (1400/LINK-2/↙↘). The effect of "Proxy F" allows Playmaker to  Fusion Summon  using Monsters on his field since if he has a Fusion Monster on his field or in GY. Using the 2 Link Tokens, he Fusion Summons " Borreload Furious Dragon " (3000/2500). As a Fusion Monster is Fusion Summoned to a zone "Proxy F" points to: its effect  allows him to summon a monster with 1000 or less ATK to his field, Playmaker Summons " L2 Cachevalier " (1000/1000), whose effect allows him to summon a LINK-2 or lower monster from his GY with negating its effects, so Playmaker summons "Exslayer" (1000/LINK-2/↙↓). Using "Cachevalier", LINK-2 "Proxy F" and "Exslayer", Playmaker Link Summons " Firewall Dragon Darkfluid " (3000/LINK-5/←↑→↙↘). When Link Summoned, "Darkfluid" gains 1 counter for every Cyberse monster in Playmaker's Graveyard of a different monster card type ( Ritual ,  Fusion ,  Synchro , or  Xyz ) a Ritual "Cyberse Magician", a Fusion "Cyberse Clock Dragon", a Synchro "Cyberse Quantum Dragon", and an Xyz "Firewall eXceed Dragon" ("Darkfluid" 0 → 4 counter).  
 Playmaker attacks "The Arrival Cyberse @Ignister" with "Firewall Dragon Darkfluid". During the Battle Phase, "Darkfluid" gains 2500 ATK for each counter it ("Firewall Dragon Darkfluid": 3000 → 13000 ATK). Ai activates the effect of "The Arrival", removing 1 counter from it to target 1 monster he controls, and make it unaffected by his opponent's card effects this turn. He targets "The Arrival". Since a Link Monster it points to is battling, the effect of "Judgment Arrows" doubles that monster's ATK ("The Arrival": 11000 → 22000 ATK). Playmaker actives the effect of "Borreload Furious Dragon": targeting a monster he controls and a card Ai controls, destroying both of them. He targets and destroys "Borreload Furious Dragon" and "Judgment Arrows". The effect of "Judgment Arrows" activates: as it was destroyed, all monsters it points to are destroyed. Ai actives the effect of "FA.I.ghting Spirit": banishing it from his Graveyard to prevent his "@Ignister" monster from being destroyed this turn. An effect of "Judgment Arrows" fail ("The Arrival": 22000 → 11000 → 10000 ATK). The attack continues, but Ai activates the effect of "Wind Pegasus @Ignister" in his Graveyard: since a Spell/Trap he controls was destroyed, he can banish "Wind Pegasus" from his Graveyard to shuffle 1 monster on the field into the Deck. He attempts to return "Darkfluid" to the Extra Deck, but Playmaker actives the effect of "Darkfluid", removing one of its counters to negate Ai's effect ("Darkfluid": 13000 → 10500 ATK, 4 → 3 counters). The attack continues, "The Arrival" isn't destroyed (Ai: 1100 → 600 LP). Because "Darkfluid" activated its counter-removing effect while attacking, it can attack again. Playmaker attacks "The Arrival" again with "Darkfluid" (Ai: 600 → 100 LP). At the end of the Battle Phase, the ATK of "Darkfluid" returns ("Darkfluid": 10500 → 3000 ATK).
 Turn 8: Ai 
Ai activates the effect of "The Arrival" to place another counter on it, but Playmaker activates the effect of "Darkfluid" to remove a counter ("Darkfluid": 3 → 2 counters) to negate the effect. Ai then activates the other effect of "The Arrival" to destroy "Darkfluid" and Summon an "@Ignister Token". Again, Playmaker negates the effect by removing a counter from "Darkfluid" ("Darkfluid": 2 → 1 counters). Since his monster effect was negated, Ai activates the effect of " Gatchiri @Ignister " in his hand, Special Summoning it (0/3000) in Defense Position. Ai Sets a card. ("The Arrival": 10000 → 12000 ATK).
 Ai attacks "Firewall Dragon Darkfluid" with "The Arrival Cyberse @Ignister". During the Battle Phase, "Darkfluid" gains 2500 x the number of counters on it ("Darkfluid": 3000 → 5500 ATK). Playmaker sends "Transcode Talker" from his Extra Deck to the Graveyard to activate "Link Pressure", increasing the ATK of "Darkfluid" by its Link Rating x 1000. Link-5 -"Darkfluid" ("Darkfluid": 5500 → 10500 ATK). The attack continues, and "Darkfluid" is destroyed (Playmaker: 2475 → 975 LP). Ai activates the effect of "Darkwight @Ignister" to inflict another 500 damage to Playmaker (Playmaker: 975 → 475 LP). As his monster destroyed "Darkfluid" by battle, Ai Summons " Gussari @Ignister " (3000/3000) from his hand in Defense Position. Ai now controls a new card ("The Arrival": 12000 → 13000 ATK). If a Link Monster "Gussari @Ignister" is linked to destroys a monster by battle, Playmaker will take damage equal to that Link Monster's ATK.
 Duel continues in the next episode . 
 
 Errors 
 In the English Dub, when Playmaker activates "Link Pressure", he says that "Darkfluid" gains 1000 ATK x the Link Rating of "Transcode Talker" instead of "Darkfluid" gains 1000 x its own Link Rating.
