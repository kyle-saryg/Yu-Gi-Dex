" Awakened Memories ", known as " Memories Brought Back " in the Japanese version, is the seventy-sixth episode of  Yu-Gi-Oh! VRAINS  anime. It aired in Japan on November 7, 2018. It aired in English on Teletoon on May 10, 2020.
 Skye , who is starting to have doubts about  SOL Technologies ' cruel methods, starts searching for  Aqua . On the other hand,  The Shepherd  has found out where Aqua is. He goes after Aqua and attacks her, but  Ghost Gal  then appears before him and blocks his path.
 
 Summary 
 In the real world,  The Shepherd  visits his mother, reflecting back on his past where both of them were in an accident due to the AI malfunctioning. Shepherd steels his resolve, believing that AI must not be allowed to control the lives of people and declares that he will not let humanity be conquered by said AI.
 Meanwhile,  Skye Zaizen  and  Emma Bessho  confront  Akira  on the situation on  Earth . Akira says that despite him believing that the  Ignis  have free will and despite him disagreeing to what has happened, he cannot disobey orders. Skye then solemnly remarks that because of the actions of SOL Technologies, it is only natural that the Ignis will hate humanity.
 At the same time,  Varis  explains to  Yusaku  and  Ai  that because SOL Technologies lack the necessary equipment and has converted him into a source code they can not fully comprehend, Earth cannot be reformed back like what happened with Ai. When Ai claims that Varis could not be trusted, Yusaku makes the educated guess that there's a spy at SOL Technologies working with the  Knights of Hanoi . Ai was devastated as he cries, saying that for the first time, he felt hatred towards humanity.
 At night, Skye has a dream about her friend,  Miyu Sugisaki  in which the latter disappears halfway through the dream. When she wakes up from the nightmare, Emma tells her that she is close to locating  Aqua . Inside  LINK VRAINS , Aqua makes a simple monument for Earth, stating that despite the cruelty of what was done to him, she will still be on the side of humans, believing in coexistence. Just as she is about to move, Shepherd locates her and begins to attack her. Aqua tries to initiate a duel with Shepherd but the latter rejects it and continues his assault. 
 Just as Aqua is about to be hit, she is saved by Skye and Emma, and through her, Skye and Emma learn about Aqua's origin: Miyu, a childhood friend of Skye. Skye then resolves to help Aqua after learning that  Lightning  has currently infected Miyu with a virus that rendered her in coma despite Aqua's best efforts to save Miyu. 
 In order to protect Skye and Aqua, Emma decided to enter a Deletion Duel (Player Killing Speed Duel in Japanese), where the loser will not only be logged out of LINK VRAINS, but will also have their account deleted and can never go back again.
