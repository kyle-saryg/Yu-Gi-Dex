 History 
       The engineers, including Tanda (left)     
 Engineers from this crew, worked at the  Valley of the Kings  excavation to retrieve the  Millennium Puzzle . [2] 
 The lab researchers worked in the  virtual Dark Yugi  reconstruction of the pharaoh. Following Kaiba's  Duel  with him, they regarded the battle a success, but Kaiba was dissatisfied. Regardless of how accurate they had reconstructed the pharaoh, it was not the real thing, making it inadequate. [2] 
 The crew conducted the necessary preparations for the robot to reconstruct the Millennium Puzzle in space and noted Kaiba of their progress at the earthport, before Kaiba departed to the  space station . [2]
