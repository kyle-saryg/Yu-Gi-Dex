 Featured Duel: Yami Marik vs. Yugi Muto - Part 4 
 Duel continues from previous episode. 
 Yami Yugi has 1000  Life Points  remaining and controls "Obelisk the Tormentor" (4000/4000) and "Dark Magician Girl" (2000/1700) in Attack Position and two set cards.
 Yami Marik has 700 Life Points remaining and controls "Egyptian God Slime" (3000/3000) and "Bowganian" (1000/700) in Defense Position and " Jam Defender ".
 Turn 13: Yami Marik 
Yami Marik has just managed to take " Monster Reborn " back from his  Graveyard  via " Mining for Magical Stones ". He then Sets a card and Normal Summons " Swallowtail Spike Lizard " (1900/700) in  Defense Position . As long as it remains in Defense Position, Marik will gain 1000  Life Points  during each of his Standby Phases.
 Turn 14: Yami Yugi 
Yami Yugi draws. He then Normal Summons " Gazelle the King of Mythical Beasts " (1500/1200) in  Defense Position  and Sets two cards. On Yami Yugi's End Phase, the effect of " Bowganian " activates ( Yugi  1000 → 700).
 Turn 15: Yami Marik 
Yami Marik draws "Surprise Attack from Beyond". On Yami Marik's Standby Phase, the effect of "Swallowtail Spike Lizard" activates ( Marik  700 → 1700). Yami Marik activates "Monster Reborn" to revive " The Winged Dragon of Ra " (0/0) in Attack Position. 
 Marik then transforms "The Winged Dragon of Ra" into  Egyptian God Phoenix . Yami Marik then activates the Egyptian God Phoenix effect of "The Winged Dragon of Ra" to pay 1000 Life Points ( Marik  1700 → 700) and attack and destroy " Obelisk the Tormentor ", but Yami Yugi activates his face-down "Monster Reborn" to revive " Slifer the Sky Dragon " (X000 → 2000/X000 → 2000) in Defense Position and use its effect - when it is Special Summoned from the Graveyard, "Slifer" will be the attack target. The "Egyptian Phoenix" effect of "The Winged Dragon of Ra" then destroys "Slifer the Sky Dragon". "The Winged Dragon of Ra" then returns to Marik's  Graveyard  in its normal form. 
 Marik activates " Surprise Attack from Beyond " to allow himself to repeat his  Battle Phase  and Special Summon "The Winged Dragon of Ra" from his Graveyard (0/0) in Attack Position. "The Winged Dragon of Ra" is now in its normal form. Yami Marik then pays all but 1 of his Life Points ( Marik  700  → 1) in order to activate the second effect of "The Winged Dragon of Ra", increasing its ATK and DEF by the total amount of  Life Points  payed ("The Winged Dragon of Ra": 0 → 699/0 → 699). This effectively "fuses" Marik with Ra.
 Yami Yugi then activates his face-down " Soul Taker " to increase Yami Marik's Life Points by 1000 ( Marik  1 → 1001) and allow Yami Yugi to use one of Marik's monsters as a  Tribute  immediately. He chooses " Egyptian God Slime " and, according to  Battle City Rules , a Fusion Monster is treated as a number of Tribute Monsters equal to its number of Fusion Material Monsters. Yami Yugi then Tributes "Egyptian God Slime" (since it is treated as a  double   Tribute ) in order to activate the first effect of "Obelisk the Tormentor" and make its ATK and DEF infinite as well as allow it to attack even though it is Yami Marik's Battle Phase.
 Yami Marik tributes "Bowganian" and "Swallowtail Spike Lizard" and pays all but 1 of his Life Points ( Marik  1001 → 1), in order to increase the ATK and DEF of "The Winged Dragon of Ra" by the total amount of  ATK / DEF  and  Life Points  tributed/payed ("The Winged Dragon of Ra": 699 → 3899 → 4899/699 → 2399 → 3399). Yami Marik then activates his face-down " Class System " to negate the attack made by "Obelisk" as its Level isn't higher than the Level of "The Winged Dragon of Ra".
 "The Winged Dragon of Ra" attacks "Obelisk the Tormentor", but Yami Yugi activates his face-down " Magical Dimension " to Tribute "Obelisk the Tormentor" and "Gazelle the King of Mythical Beasts" in order to  Special Summon  " Dark Magician " (2500/2100) in  Attack Position . Since "Obelisk" has left the field, the attack made by "The Winged Dragon of Ra" is negated as it has lost its original target. Yami Yugi is about to activate his face-down " Ragnarok ", which will remove "The Winged Dragon of Ra" from play.
 Duel concludes next episode. 
 
 Differences in adaptations 
 In the dub, whilst  Marik  is possessing  Téa , balls of yellow light are added to Téa's eyes. 
 When  Marik  is thinking how  Yami  could be so forgiving after all he has done to him,  Marik 's flashback is changed in the dub to show Marik on his ship, then  Lumis and Umbra  and various Rare Hunters, before showing mind-controlled  Téa  and  Joey . In the Japanese version, the flashback shows  Pandora , then the  Silent Puppet . 
 As in previous episodes, cut is a shot of  Marik  wagging his tongue.
