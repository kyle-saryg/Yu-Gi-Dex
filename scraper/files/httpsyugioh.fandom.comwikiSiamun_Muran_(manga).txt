 Siamun Muran  is a character in the  Yu-Gi-Oh!  manga . This is the manga version of  Shimon Muran . Simon served as a  High Priest  to  Pharaoh Akhenamkhanen  and vizier to  Pharaoh Atem . His name means "son of Amun".
 
 Biography 
 Siamun was originally one of the Pharaoh  Akhenamkhanen 's guardians, and he was granted the Millennium Key to hold. His Ka (or his monster spirit) that he summoned was " Exodia the Forbidden One " and he swore to seal it and never use it again after he destroyed the force that was attacking the Egyptian capital. He apparently gave up his position of guardian to  Shada , and to him he relinquished the  Millennium Key .
 He plays a largely minor role in the  King's Memories  arc at first, as he introduces much of the ancient ways and terminology to the Pharaoh  Atem .
 
When Atem reexperienced his past through the  Memory World , he awoke shortly before the exorcism of  Dark Spirit of Chaos , with little knowledge of his life prior to that point. Siamun told Atem off for sleeping and Atem mistakenly called him " Grandpa ". Siamun mistook Atem's lack of knowledge, as a symptom of his tiredness and explained the nature of monster ka and some of the roles of the  Millennium Items  to him. [2]       Siamun, with his face covered     
 Siamun designed Atem's tomb, filling it with several traps and  Shadow Games  to stop thieves. He informed  Atem  that  Akhenamkhanen's  tomb had been a prototype for this one and that no thief, regardless of skill, would be able to get past the traps of a royal tomb. However, as he was speaking  Thief King Bakura  entered the palace, carrying treasures he had stolen from Akhenamkhanen's tomb and dragging Akhenamkhanen's mummy with a piece of rope. [3]  Atem then drove Bakura off by summoning " The God of Obelisk ".
 When  Zorc Necrophades  was summoned and begins to march on the city, Siamun takes up the Millennium Key and summons Exodia to combat Zorc. Although Exodia experiences some success, eliminating the Army of the Dead, Zorc overpowers Exodia because its power is based on Siamun's, while Zorc can draw power from the darkness. Therefore, Exodia is destroyed and Siamun is killed.
