      Isolation Dome     
 The  Isolation Dome  is a dome that isolates a room its used in from the rest of the world.
 
 Overview 
 When activated, the switches pop up from the ground and power surges around the tips to close it inside a barrier. The dome also separates from the earth and floats around in space. It was first used by  Leo Akaba  to prevent  Yuya Sakaki  and  Yuri  from going inside  ARC-V  to become  Z-ARC .  Declan ,  Riley ,  Sora , and  Aster  were also trapped with them until Yuya became the  Supreme King Z-ARC , causing the dome to explode and returning the room back to  Duel Academy . [1]
