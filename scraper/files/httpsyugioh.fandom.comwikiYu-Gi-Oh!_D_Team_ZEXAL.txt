 Summary 
       Yuma Tsukumo  in  Yu-Gi-Oh! D Team ZEXAL .     
 In contrast to the  first manga , this one focuses on humor and all characters are drawn in a   chibi  style. Different from the canon series, which aim at a juvenile public, this manga series aims at younger children, and teaches them how to play the  Yu-Gi-Oh!  OCG  with a light and humored plot. 
 In this story,  Yuma Tsukumo ,  Kotori Mizuki ,  Takashi Todoroki , and  Tetsuo Takeda  form a  Dueling Team  named  ZEXAL . Also, Yuma knows  Astral  since the beginning, but he is still the only one who can see him.

 Rules 
 The rules used in the manga, as well as the cards, are the  OCG  ones. This means that "Number" monsters can be destroyed in battle by monsters that aren't "Numbers".

 Differences from other series 
       The  OCG  artworks used in the manga.     
 This is the first  Yu-Gi-Oh!  series to illustrate the characters using a chibi style. However, the monsters are illustrated normally. 
 The illustrations for the cards are taken directly from the  OCG . 
 
 Trivia 
 Out of the three Yu-Gi-Oh! anime and manga series to bear the name ZEXAL, this is the only series to showcase all the different types of Extra Deck monsters known to date ( Fusion ,  Synchro  and  Xyz ).
