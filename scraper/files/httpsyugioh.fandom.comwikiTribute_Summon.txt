GX  anime series, is a form of  Normal Summoning  a  Level  5 or higher  monster  by  Tributing  at least one monster you  control . It was previously referred to as a  Sacrifice Summon  ( 生 け 贄 召 喚   Ikenie Shōkan ) in the OCG and the  Yu-Gi-Oh!  and  Yu-Gi-Oh! GX  anime series.

 Mechanics 
 By default, Level 5 and 6 monsters require one Tribute, while Level 7 and higher require two Tributes. Tribute Summon counts toward the turn's Normal Summon/Set limit.
 Tributing a monster for a Tribute Summon is part of a  Summoning condition . Therefore, if the Tribute Summon is  negated , the Tributed monster(s) will not return to the field.
 If no cards are Tributed to perform the Normal Summon of a Level 5 or higher monster (as in the case of " Mausoleum of the Emperor "), the Summon is not a Tribute Summon, unless a card specifies otherwise (such as " Tribute Burial ").
 
 Tribute Set 
 Main article:  Tribute Set Tribute Set  is to Set a Level 5 or higher monster. 
 Other Tribute requirements 
 Three Tributes 
 Main article:  Normal Summon with 3 Tributes 
 Some Level 8 or higher monsters can be Normal Summoned with three Tributes, instead of just two, and activate a further effect when Tribute Summoned this way.
 Some monsters can only be Normal Summoned with three Tributes, some of which even specify the Tribute requirements (such as " Steelswarm Hercules ", and most  Main Deck   Match winners ). Many of those monsters  cannot be Special Summoned .
 
 Substitute Spell/Trap for Tributes 
 Main article:  Uses Spell/Trap Cards as Tributes for Normal Summon 
 Some monsters allow  Spell  or  Trap Cards  to be Tributed in place of monsters, such as " Dinomight Knight, the True Dracofighter " and " Ancient Gear Castle ". 
 
 Summon with less Tribute than required 
 See also:  Normal Summon without Tribute  and  Normal Summon with 1 Tribute 
 Some high-Level monsters are allowed to be Normal Summoned with fewer or no Tributes. " Fog King " can be Tribute Summoned with 1 Tribute, or Normal Summoned without a Tribute. " Mausoleum of the Emperor " allows either player to  pay   Life Points  instead of Tributing monsters. Depending on their stats, these monsters usually have a negative effect when summoned by their reduced Tribute requirement, such as having less ATK, leaving the field at the end of the turn, or not being allowed to attack.
