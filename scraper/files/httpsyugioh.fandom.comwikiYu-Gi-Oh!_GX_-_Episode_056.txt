 Summary 
   This summary is currently incomplete. 
 As  Chazz Princeton  will still be staying at the  Slifer Red  dorm, he used his family's money to build an add-on to it for him to occupy. It's the size of a small house by itself, and is complete with an indoor pool and two floors. He starts by recording Syrus getting into a fight with  Hassleberry .  Alexis Rhodes  arrives and explains that she has moved out of the  Obelisk Blue  dorm, due to  Dr. Crowler  and  her brother 's urgings to make Alexis and Atticus a singing duo. Chazz gives the whole group a tour of his expansion and Alexis asks if she can stay here at the Slifer Red dorm. Chazz allows her to have the expansion and thus has to move back in with  Jaden Yuki  and  Syrus Truesdale .
 Bastion Misawa  arrives and informs Syrus that Dr. Crowler has set up a Duel between him and an Obelisk Blue student,  Missy . This is part of Crowler's plan to find the school a representative for the  Pro League . Syrus was chosen as one of the duelists because of  his brother 's status. Should he win, he'll be promoted to  Ra Yellow . If Missy wins, Dr. Crowler will let her advance to the Pro League, which she wishes to do because she in love with Zane. Syrus doesn't like the situation and runs away. Hassleberry runs after him and sets him straight, telling Syrus to fight his fear. He persuades Syrus to take advantage of the opportunity he has, calling it Syrus' chance to "evolve". That night, as Syrus thinks about what Hassleberry said, He soon realizes his fear is that the others will move on as duelists and leave him behind. The next day, Syrus seals his " Power Bond " card in an envelope and hands it to Chazz, telling him to deliver it to Jaden. Syrus wins the Duel without "Power Bond" through " Super Vehicroid Jumbo Drill ", thus advancing to Ra Yellow. However, he still opts to live at the Slifer Red dorm.

 Featured Duel: Missy vs. Syrus Truesdale 
 Turn 1: Missy 
Missy draws " Prickle Fairy " and subsequently  Normal Summons  it (300/2000) in  Defense Position . While this card is face-up, Syrus can't attack Insect-type monsters.
 Turn 2: Syrus 
Syrus draws " Shield Crush " and subsequently activates it to destroy "Prickle Fairy". He then Normal Summons " Steamroid " (1800/1800) in  Attack Position . "Steamroid" attacks  directly  (Missy 4000 → 2200).
 Turn 3: Missy 
Missy draws " Pinch Hopper " and subsequently Normal Summons it (1000/1200) in Attack Position. She then activates " Multiplication of Ants " to  Tribute  "Pinch Hopper" and  Special Summon  two " Army Ant Tokens " (500/500 each) in Attack Position. Since "Pinch Hopper" was sent to the Graveyard, its effect activates, allowing Missy to Special Summon an  Insect - Type  monster from her hand. She chooses to Special Summon " Insect Princess " (1900/1200) in Attack Position. [Notes 1]  Missy then activates " Insect Garden ". Now control of all face-up Level 4 or below Insect-type monsters Missy controls will be given to Syrus; control of the "Army Ant Tokens" switch over to Syrus. 
 Missy then activates " Insect Pheromone " and equips it to " Insect Princess ". "Insect Princess" attacks and destroys one "Army Ant Tokens" (Syrus 4000 → 2600). Since "Insect Princess" destroyed an Insect-type monster in battle, its effect activates, increasing its ATK by 500 ("Insect Princess": 1900 → 2400/1200). Since "Insect Princess" destroyed a monster in battle, the effect of "Insect Pheromone" activates, allowing Missy to force the other "Army Ant Token" to battle "Insect Princess". "Insect Princess" attacks and destroys the second "Army Ant Token" (Syrus 2600 → 700). The second effect of "Insect Princess" activates again ("Insect Princess": 2400 → 2900/1200).
 Turn 4: Syrus 
Syrus draws. He then switches "Steamroid" to Defense Position. Syrus then Normal Summons " Submarineroid " (800/1800) in Attack Position. "Submarineroid" attacks directly due to its own effect (Missy 2200 → 1400).  Since "Submarineroid" attacked, Syrus activates its second effect to switch it to Defense Position at the end of the Damage Step. Syrus then  Sets  a card.
 Turn 5: Missy 
Missy draws " Magical Longicorn " and subsequently Normal Summons it (600/1600) in Attack Position. Due to "Insect Garden's" effect, "Magical Longicorn" switches control over to Syrus. Due to the effect of "Magical Longicorn", the effects of all of Syrus's  Normal Spell Cards  are now  negated . "Insect Princess" attacks "Magical Longicorn", but Syrus activates his face-down " No Entry!! " to switch all monsters on the field to Defense Position (except "Magical Longicorn" since the first effect of "Insect Princess" forces it to remain in Attack Position) and force Missy to  discard  one card from her hand. [Notes 2] 
 Turn 6: Syrus 
Syrus draws " Vehicroid Connection Zone " and subsequently activates it ("Magical Longicorn" cannot negate the effect of "Vehicroid Connection Zone", as its effect cannot be negated) to fuse "Submarineroid" and "Steamroid" with " Drillroid " in order to  Fusion Summon  " Super Vehicroid Jumbo Drill " (3000/2000) in Attack Position. [Notes 3]  "Super Vehicroid Jumbo Drill" attacks and destroys "Insect Princess". "Super Vehicroid Jumbo Drill" then inflicts  piercing  damage to Missy (Missy 1400 → 0).

 Notes 
 
 ↑   In the  OCG / TCG , the  effect  of  " Pinch Hopper " would not  activate  if it was Tributed as a cost, as it would  miss the timing . 
 
 ↑   In the  TCG / OCG , " No Entry!! " does not require the opponent to  discard  cards. 
 
 ↑   In the  TCG / OCG , " Vehicroid Connection Zone " does not prevent itself from being negated; it protects the  Fusion Monster  summoned by its effect from  card effects  that would destroy it or negate its effects. 
 
 ↑   This card belongs to Syrus, but he gave it to Chazz in order to prove to his friends that he doesn't need to rely on others to help him. Chazz would later give this card to Jaden before Syrus and Missy's Duel starts. At the end of the episode, Jaden returns this card to Syrus.
