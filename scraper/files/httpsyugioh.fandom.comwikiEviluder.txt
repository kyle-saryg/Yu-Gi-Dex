 Appearance 
       Eviluder's full appearance.     Eviluder is a huge man, with muscular arms and a punk style. He has a spiked Mohican and stars in his forehead and belly. He has no eyebrows and a large nose. His  Duel Gazer  cover the right half of his head, and he covers his mouth and neck with a mechanical-looking device, giving him some resemblance to a  cyborg . His  D-Pad  is a standard model. Also, he wears no shirt, but a large dark cape instead. His  Main Deck  and  Extra Deck  slots are located at the front of his belt, with an aircraft-related device separating them. Eviluder wears dark pants, boots and bracelets.
 Etymology 
 This character's Japanese name seems to be a  portmanteau  of "evil" (イビル  Ibiru ) and "invader" (インベーダー  Inbēdā ) - adapted to "Eviluder" in English.
 
 Voice/Mannerisms 
 Eviluder uses terms related to fleets and spaceships, referring to his cards as "his fleet" and to  Yuma 's " Tin Balloon Tokens " as "anti-aircraft mines", for example.
 
 Biography 
 One day, the  Numbers Club  gathered at  Cathy 's mansion, when a big monitor detected a huge source of energy coming from a  Duel  involving a " Numbers ".  Tetsuo Takeda  rushed there, and found Eviluder. They Dueled, but Tetsuo lost and was seriously injured, having to be hospitalized.
 The following day, as  Yuma Tsukumo  returned home from school, Eviluder appeared, introducing himself as  Dr. Faker 's #1 Fleet Commander. He and Yuma then began a Duel. [1] 
 Although Eviluder quickly overpowered Yuma with his "Number" [2] , Yuma managed to win with a card he got from Tetsuo. As Eviluder lost,  Kyoji Yagumo  showed up and told him that he didn't need incompetent people, and that the moment he became his subordinate, his "pet" - a spider - was already haunting Eviluder's heart. Eviluder promptly screamed and fell to the ground, as  the spider attacked his heart . He is presumably dead. [3]
