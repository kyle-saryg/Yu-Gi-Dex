 Appeareance 
       Full-body image of Rinnosuke.     
 Rino is a bespectacled fair-skinned boy with hazel eyes and orange hair in a severe hairstyle, similar to his sister,  Rayne . He dresses smartly in a grey waistcoat and green sleeveless, neck-less topover a white shirt, blue tie, and grey shorts, with knee-length blue socks and brown slip-on shoes. Rino wears rectangular spectacles with a red half-frame.
 When  Gavin  Duels using Sogetsu Style, Rino dons  Kuroko  stagehand clothing; a charcoal veil with a black band, a grey top and pants, black tunic and shoes, and a red sash. [2]  He also wears it when aiding  Romin  in cooking. [3] 
 
 Personality 
 Rino is very devoted to Gavin and his duties, and he fiercely defends their relationship when he perceives Yuga as mocking them. He attempts to convince Gavin to abandon his interest in Rush Dueling and return to his duties, showing satisfaction at the notion that Gavin would not be dealing with Yuga and his friends again. [2]  However, he comes to like Rush Dueling and aids in efforts to prevent Yuga from being disqualified during his Duel with  Roa Kassidy . He is also very supportive towards his sister and is always there for her if she needs him. They seem to understand each other so well that they dont always need words to understand what the other thinks. Yet he also knows when he has to stop her from making a mistake if she has developted a new crush on someone because she misheard something. That been said, Rino seemed also to fall easy in love with other girls when they get close to him. So he devolped a little crush on Romin just because she touched his shoulder and thanked him for his help. [4]
