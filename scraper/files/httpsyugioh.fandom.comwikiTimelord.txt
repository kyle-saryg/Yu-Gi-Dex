 Design 
       The Tree of Life and the Timelords.     
 The first 10 "Timelords" are based on the 10 attributes or emanations of the  Tree of Life , the mystic symbol used in the  Kabbalah , known as the  Sefirot . The 11th member, " Sephylon, the Ultimate Timelord ", is named after the Sefirot itself (Sephirot). The "Timelords" are depicted as metal suits of armor with an angel face on their chest.
 The first 10 "Timelords" each reflect a Sefirah, as well as an  archangel . " Sephylon " reflects the mystical state where all 10 Sefirots become one,  Da'at , and God.
 
 Members 
 The first 10 "Timelords" share the following texts:
 
 Cannot be  Special Summoned  from the  Deck . If you control no  monsters , you can  Normal Summon  this card without  Tributing .  (Except "Sandaion"; it can be Normal Summoned without Tributing if only the opponent controls a monster.) 
 Cannot be  destroyed by battle  or  card effects . You take no  battle damage  from  attacks  involving this card.  (" Metaion, the Timelord " only prevents battle damage if it is in  Attack Position . " Sandaion, the Timelord " prevents both players from taking battle damage.) 
 At the end of the  Battle Phase , if this card  battled : [Unique effect]. 
 Once per turn , during your  Standby Phase :  Shuffle  this card into the Deck."

 Playing style 
 "Timelord"  monsters  have a  Stall  and  Burn  playstyle. They protect themselves from most form of destruction while also protecting the player from  battle damage . Their powerful  effects  not only heavily cripple the opponent's play but also inflict heavy  damage  to the opponent. As they do not rely on  Special Summons , they can utilize many  anti-meta  cards to further support their own without any drawbacks. The weakness of "Timelord" monsters returning to the Deck during the Standby Phase can be mitigated with effects that negate single instances of activation, like " Mist Valley Apex Avian " and " Red-Eyes Dark Dragoon " or cards like " G.B. Hunter ".

 Weaknesses 
 While the "Timelords" cannot be destroyed, they can still be  banished ,  Tributed , sent to the  GY  without being destroyed, returned to the hand, set  face-down , used as  material  for  Extra Deck  Summons (e.g. via cards like " Synchro Material ") and have their effects negated. Their Summon can also be negated by a card like " Solemn Warning ". To overcome these weaknesses, cards that protect against direct attacks can be useful.
 Since all "Timelords" are Level 10, cards like " Level Limit - Area B " and " Gravity Bind " can easily prevent them from attacking and being able to use their powerful effects. Since it is very difficult to control more than 1 "Timelord", cards like " Scrap-Iron Scarecrow " and " Threatening Roar " are also very effective at stopping their attacks.
 Cards that can attack the opponent directly, such as " Earthbound Immortal " or " Toon " monsters can be very useful against "Timelord" monsters, as they can bypass their protection and effects and deal your opponent significant damage in the process.
 "Timelord" monsters rely on attacking for their effects to activate, so any number of basic  stall  cards that aim to block the opponent's attacks will stop them as well, including  battle position  changers. However, this weakness can be overcome by using cards that force the "Timelord" monster to be attacked.
 Attacking an opponent's monster with a "Timelord" monster that has 0  ATK  can be dangerous if the opponent can activate a card that can negate the effects of the "Timelord" monster, such as " Breakthrough Skill " or " Infinite Impermanence ", since those cards nullify the "Timelord" monsters protection from destruction and  battle damage .
 "Timelord" monsters are also especially weak against " Blue-Eyes Twin Burst Dragon " because it banishes any monster that is not destroyed by it when it attacks. Since the "Timelord" is banished, its effect cannot trigger and it bypasses the "Timelord" non-destroyable effect via banishment.
 
 Trivia 
 In the anime, all the Timelords have a  Rare  rarity with exception of " Sephylon ", which has an  Ultra Rare  rarity instead. 
 Although this archetype is not related to the  Duel Terminal  storyline, they can be considered to be a counterpart to  Infernoids . The Timelords are based on the Archangels of the ten Sephirot while the Infernoids are based on the demons that correspond to the ten Qliphoth. 
 Compared to the anime version,  Michion, the Timelord  just halves your opponent LP without inflicting damage at all, so cards like  Prime Material Dragon  or  Muscle Medic  will have no use against it. Therefore, it is the only Timelord whose unique effect gets better compared to the corresponding anime version, while some of the other Timelords even got their effects weakened.
