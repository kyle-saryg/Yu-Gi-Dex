 Summary 
 Everyone is dropped through tunnels and wakes up in a  virtual world .  Kaiba  is with  Mokuba  and  Tristan  is with  Duke , but everyone else is isolated. 
 Noah  sends  Gansley  to challenge  Yugi .
 Because Gansley has no body of his own, he has taken the form of " Deepsea Warrior ", which serves as his  Deck Master . 
 Yugi must construct his Deck from scratch by choosing from a supply of virtual cards, and Egyptian God Cards are not in the available database. (This is true for all Duels in this arc.) He also must choose each card wisely because once he chooses a card it remains in his Deck until the end of the Duel. 
 Going through his cards in the search for a Deck Master,  Yami Yugi  is about to choose " Dark Magician ", but " Kuriboh " emerges from its  card  on its own.
 Yami Yugi protests that he didn't choose "Kuriboh", but Gansley declares that it cannot be changed. Yami Yugi accepts it. 
 Gansley boasts his knowledge of successful business practices (philosophy and warfare in the Japanese version) as he gathers extra monsters and depletes Yami Yugi's reserves.
 This proves to be more than mere talk when he meets a headstrong attack with his Deck Master ability, saving him and damaging Yami Yugi severely. 
 Duke and Tristan are sent to a medieval castle where they are trapped inside. They attempt to run down a hallway looking for  Serenity  but soon realize that it is endless. Trying to escape, Tristan attempts to break through the walls with a halberd taken from a nearby suit of armor. This leaves Duke puzzled, as everything is supposed to be a virtual illusion, yet Tristan is able to hold the halberd. 
 Serenity herself is transported to a large lagoon populated with geese and containing a small pier. To her surprise, Serenity is able to feel the supposedly virtual lagoon’s cool water. This causes her to worry about her brother and wishes to find him. 
 Joey , similar to Duke and Tristan, finds himself outside of a large manor. Seeking to find and duel the members of the Big Five, he enters inside, but he is unable to find anyone as he wanders alone. 
 Téa  finds herself alone in a canyon-like wasteland surrounded by large rock formations. Hoping to find her friends, she wanders through the canyon but is stalked and eventually attacked by a group of  Hitotsu-Me Giants . During the ambush, while trying to escape, she sustains a small cut on her left cheek from one of the giant’s attacks despite that everything is supposed to be an illusion. The terrified girl attempts to flee from the monsters, but another of them suddenly blocks her escape and strikes her down with a swipe from its claws. 
 Kaiba and Mokuba are transported to a large forest with a path through it. Walking down the forest’s path, they ponder Noah’s reasoning for abducting them, his connection to the Big Five, and the nature of his virtual simulations. Eventually, they find an odd virtual gateway in the form of a door. Hoping that it is an exit, they open and enter inside it. To their shock, behind the door is an image of the orphanage where they used to live as children.. 
 Featured Duel: Yami Yugi vs. Gansley 
 Yugi 's  Deck Master  is " Kuriboh ".  Gansley 's Deck Master is " Deepsea Warrior ".
 Turn 1: Gansley 
 Gansley   draws  a  monster  and subsequently  Sets  it.
 Turn 2: Yugi 
 Yugi  draws " Obnoxious Celtic Guardian " and subsequently Normal Summons it (1400/1200) in  Attack Position . He then Sets a card. "Obnoxious Celtic Guardian"  attacks  and  destroys  Gansley's Set monster, which is " Ashingray " (500/500). The  Flip Effect  of "Ashingray" then  activates , forcing Yugi to  discard  a card (" Exchange "). As "Ashingray" was  destroyed by battle  the second effect of "Ashingray" activates, letting Gansley  Special Summon  another copy of "Ashingray" from his  Deck  (500/500) in  face-down   Defense Position . Yugi's hand contains " Gazelle the King of Mythical Beasts ", " Berfomet ", and " De-Spell ".
 Turn 3: Gansley 
Gansley draws " Ipiria " and subsequently Normal Summons it (500/500) in Attack Position. The effect of "Ipiria" then activates, allowing Gansley to draw a card. Gansley then  Flip Summons  "Ashingray" (500/500). This activates the Flip Effect of "Ashingray" and Yugi discards "De-Spell".
 Turn 4: Yugi 
Yugi draws " Polymerization " and subsequently activates it to  fuse  the "Berfomet" and "Gazelle the King of Mythical Beasts" in his hand in order to  Fusion Summon  " Gazelle the King of Mythical Beasts " (2100/1800) in Attack Position. Yugi then activates his face-down " Quick Attack " to allow "Chimera" to attack this  turn  even though it's a Fusion Monster. "Chimera" attacks "Ipiria", but Gansley activates the  Deck Master ability  of "Deepsea Warrior" to  negate  the attack and inflict  damage  to Yugi equal to the attacking monster's ATK (Yugi 4000 → 1900) by  Tributing  "Ashingray" and Ipiria".
 Duel continues in  the next episode . 
 
 Differences In adaptations 
         
 Gansley  doesn't introduce himself in the Japanese version, and the image of his face overlaying with that of " Deepsea Warrior " doesn't occur. 
 In the Japanese episodes, throughout the 3 parts of this Duel,  Yugi  can understand what " Kuriboh " is saying while in the dub he can not. 
 In the Japanese dub, when Anzu is being chased by the Hitotsu-Me Giant monsters, she calls out for Yugi to help her. In the dub however, she just calls for someone to help her. 
 The small rock that strikes  Anzu 's face when she is attacked by the Hitotsu-Me Giant monsters leaves a small gash in the original which caused her to groan in real pain. This is digitized out in the dub but the pained groaning part still happens regardless of the version. This is, after her friend Tristan Taylor, the only time in the original series where a human character gets hurt outside of dueling.
