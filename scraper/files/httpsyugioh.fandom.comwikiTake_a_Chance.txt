 Take a Chance  is the first English opening and ending theme of the  Yu-Gi-Oh! ZEXAL  series.
 
   https://yugioh.fandom.com/wiki/File:Take_a_Chance.ogg     Yu-Gi-Oh! ZEXAL Theme     
 Similar to  Hyper Drive , this intro was first showcased on the 4Kids website. It debuted on  episode 1  and stopped airing on  episode 73 , being replaced on  episode 74  by the song  Halfway to Forever . It also plays during the final scene of  episode 146 . 
 By  Episode 26 , major changes were made to the opening sequence. Among them, the card backs use the WDC design like in Japan, and many new characters appear, including the  Vetrix Family . However, due to them being shadows in the first episode of Season 2, the intro features them with their faces revealed rather than being them in shadows in the Japanese opening " BRAVING! ".
 The song is composed and produced by Michael Brady, with lyrics written by Shane Guenego, Arthur "Sam" Murakami and Brady. [1]  Additional work was performed by both Brendan Brady and Stephen Saxon of the Surefire Music Group.

 Lyrics 
 English  French  Italian  European Portuguese  Mexican Spanish  
 If life is a game 
They say I can't win 
I'll never amount to nothin' 
Tear me down before my life begins, 
 
I won't be afraid, 
To challenge myself 
They won't ever break my fire. 
My dreams won't die 
If I high-five the sky 
Spread my wings, 
Take off, it's time to fly! 
 
Take a chance to make it all the way 
Take a chance forgetting yesterday! 
Take a chance with me... 
 
Nothing will bring me down, 
No retreat when I leave all my fears behind 
My future's still alive inside!! 
Take a chance and chase my doubts away, 
Believing gets me through my darkest days 
 
Take a chance to make it all the way, 
Take a chance forgetting yesterday 
Take a breath, my heart will lead the way, 
 
Take a chance, I'll take a chance in today! 
 
 Si la vraie de la vie est un jeu, 
J'aurai cette envie de gagner. 
Mes amis sont là pour m'aider. 
Je n'aurai pas peur de relever le défi. 
Ils n'éteindront pas la flamme en moi. 
Mes rêves peuvent se réaliser. 
Déploie tes ailes, il est temps de voler ! 
 
Tente ta chance, tu peux y arriver, 
Tente ta chance et oublie le passé ! 
Tente ta chance et gagne... 
 
Non, rien ne m'arrêtera. 
Car je laisse toutes mes peurs derrière moi, 
Et je crois toujours en mon avenir. 
C'est sûr ma chance si je sais tous mes doutes. 
Si je crois en moi, je surmonterai les épreuves. 
 
Tente ta chance, tu peux y arriver, 
Tente ta chance et oublie le passé ! 
Tente ta chance, tu peux te dépasser, 
Tente ta chance, oui, tente ta chance pour gagner !
 
 
 Mi dicono che non vincerò 
Che non sarò mai qualcuno 
Ma la mia risposta adesso è no 
Non mi arrenderò 
 
Nessuno potrà 
Fermare il mio fuoco ardente 
Ho un sogno grande nella mente 
E quel momento adesso arriverà 
 
C'è una strada da percorrere 
Superando l'impossibile 
Io ci riuscirò 
 
Niente mi fermerà 
Le mie paure lascierò dietro di me 
Perchè un futuro ancora c'è 
Nessun dubbio mi rallenterà 
La forza adesso mi accompagnerà 
 
C'è una strada da percorrere 
Superando l'impossibile 
Con il mio coraggio affronterò 
 
Questo viaggio e so che ci riuscirò 
 Se a vida é um jogo 
Seguir e vencer 
Derrota serve para nada 
E neste jogo tu irás aprender 
 
E não vou ter medo de me desafiar 
Eu tenho em mim um pouco 
Os sonhos nunca se vão apagar 
Se abrir as asas vou voar 
 
Se tentar, tu podes conseguir 
Se tentar, eu sei que irás vencer 
Se tentar, acredita 
 
Nada te vai parar 
Pois agora não há mais nenhuma pra parar 
Porque o futuro está ali e vais chegar 
Se tentar, não tens nada a temer 
Se tentar, o escuro fica luz 
 
Se tentar, tu podes conseguir 
Se tentar, eu sei que irás vencer 
Se tentar, aposta o coração 
 
Se tentar, o melhor começa aqui 
 La vida es un juego que hay que ganar 
Tal vez sí exista un riesgo 
Y el miedo no me va a frenar, 
 
Valor yo tendré, 
Y me enfrentaré 
A quien quiera detenerme mis sueños 
Van a hacerse realidad 
¡Ten confianza, atrévete a volar! 
 
Ten confianza, tienes el poder 
Ten confianza, no hay por qué temer! 
Debes de creer en ti...  
 
Nada me detendrá, seguiré adelante 
Ya no hay marcha atrás 
¡¡Podré mis sueños alcanzar!! 
Toma el riesgo, atrévete a jugar, 
El juego de la vida hay que emprender 
 
Ten confianza, tienes el poder 
Ten confianza, no hay por qué temer 
Ten confianza, el juego hay que encender, 
 
¡Ten confianza, el mundo hay que defender!

 Errors 
       Short skirt error.     
 In both of the Season 1 and Season 2 versions of this opening, Tori's skirt was not lengthened. 
 In both versions of the opening, when  Yuma  opens  The Door ,  Astral 's eyes are both golden.
