 Rank-Up
 
 
 Rank-Up  (ランクアップ  Rankuappu ) is a method that uses an  Xyz Monster  to Summon another Xyz Monster of a higher  Rank  in the  Yu-Gi-Oh! ZEXAL  and  Yu-Gi-Oh! ARC-V  animes. 
 A variant of  Xyz Evolution , it was first seen in the Duel between  Yuma Tsukumo  and the  Barian  pawn  Fender , who used " Rank-Up-Magic Barian's Force " to Rank-Up " Mechquipped Angineer " into " CXyz Mechquipped Djinn Angeneral ". From then on, the  Barians  and their pawns, as well as  Yuma Tsukumo ,  Number 96 , and  Eliphas  easily Rank-Up with use of the " Rank-Up-Magic " archetype, " Chaos Field ", and " Don Thousand's Throne ". 
 Additionally, in the  Yu-Gi-Oh! ZEXAL  manga,  Kyoji Yagumo  uses Rank-Up as a means of bringing out his other " Numbers " instead of using Rank-Up to evolve them into " Number C " by using the card called " Rank-Up Spider Web ".
 In the  Yu-Gi-Oh! ARC-V  anime, it was first used by  Shay Obsidian  in the Duel against  Sora Perse .
 When a regular Xyz Monster is Ranked Up, it usually results in a " CXyz " monster. When a "Number" is Ranked Up, it becomes a "Number C".
 According to  Astral , only those who have "Ranked-Up" in a spiritual way can visit the  Astral World .

 Chaos Xyz Evolution 
 Main article:  Xyz Evolution § Chaos Xyz Evolution 
 This was the first method of Ranking-Up seen. It is typically used by  Barians  and their brainwashed pawns.  This type of Rank-Up has only been seen being used by cards with the  power of Chaos , such as " Rank-Up-Magic Barian's Force ", " Rank-Up-Magic Limited Barian's Force ", " Rank-Up-Magic Numeron Force ", " Chaos Field ", " Rank-Up-Magic Argent Chaos Force ", " Rank-Up-Magic The Seventh One ", " Don Thousand's Throne " and " Rank-Up-Magic Quick Chaos ". All " Number " monsters Ranked-Up in this method become " Number C " monsters, while other monsters become " CXyz " monsters.
 
 Double Rank-Up 
 Double Rank-Up  (ダブルランクアップ  Daburu Rankuappu ) , a.k.a.  Rank-Up Xyz Evolution , is in essence the same method, although rather than merely Summoning a monster 1  Rank  higher, it allows one to Summon an  Xyz Monster   2  Ranks higher than the target. Eliphas was the first to perform Double Rank-Up in the  Yu-Gi-Oh! ZEXAL  anime. In the  TCG / OCG , Double Rank-Up can be achieved by using the cards " Rank-Up-Magic Astral Force ", " Rank-Up-Magic Soul Shave Force " and " Rank-Up-Magic Skip Force ".
 
 Example 
 A " Rank-Up-Magic "  Spell Card  (" Rank-Up-Magic Numeron Force ") + A  Rank 4   Xyz Monster  (" Number 39: Utopia ") = An appropriate  Rank 5  Xyz Monster (" Number C39: Utopia Ray Victory ")
