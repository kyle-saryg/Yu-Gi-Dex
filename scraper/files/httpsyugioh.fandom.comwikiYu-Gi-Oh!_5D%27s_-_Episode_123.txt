 Summary 
   This summary is currently incomplete. 
 The next opponent for  Team 5D's  is  Team Ragnarok , who wield the  Rune Eyes , serving as the proof of their status as the successors of the " Aesir ". When Team 5D's encounter them,  Halldor  takes the opportunity to explain the story behind the "Aesirs" and how the members of Team Ragnarok came to obtain them.
 Yusei then asks the three members of Team Ragnarok to help expose the plot of  Team New World . However,  Halldor  declines, claiming that the "Aesir" are not willing to enter an alliance with the  Crimson Dragon 's  Signers , believing Yusei to be cursed because  Dr. Fudo  caused  Zero Reverse . The enmity between  Dragan  and  Jack  is also explored, as the two had Dueled in the past, only for Dragan to be forced to lose on purpose by  Lazar  and  Rex Goodwin  in order to raise money for his father's hospitalization.
 Team Ragnarok challenges Team 5D's in tomorrow's semifinal match, where the winner earns the right to face Team New World.
 
 Featured Duel: Jack vs. Dragan 
 This  Duel  is a flashback to  Jack 's time as King.
 Turn 1: Jack  
Jack's hand contains " Reaction Summon ", " Burning Rebirth ", " Power Breaker ", " Barrier Resonator " and " Trap Eater ".  Jack  draws " Top Runner " and subsequently Normal Summons it ( 4/1100/800) in  Attack Position . He then  Sets  two cards.
 Turn 2: Dragan 
 Dragan  draws. During the Standby Phase, the effect of " Speed World " activates (Jack's SPC: 0 → 1; Dragan's SPC: 0 → 1). He then Normal Summons " Garmr of the Nordic Beasts " ( 4/800/1900) in Attack Position and Sets a card.
 Turn 3: Jack  
Jack draws " Tuner's Reflect ". During the Standby Phase, the effect of "Speed World" activates (Jack's SPC: 1 → 2; Dragan's SPC: 1 → 2). Jack then Normal Summons "Power Breaker" ( 4/1900/0) in Attack Position. He then tunes "Power Breaker" with "Top Runner" in order to  Synchro Summon  " Red Dragon Archfiend " ( 8/3000/2000) in Attack Position. "Red Dragon Archfiend"  attacks  "Garmr". Dragan is about to  activate  his  face-down  " Nordic Relic Brisingamen " (which would have won him the Duel), but he chooses not to. "Red Dragon Archfiend" then destroys "Garmr of the Nordic Beasts" (Dragan 4000 → 1800).
 The rest of the  Duel  is not shown, but Dragan lost the Duel.
 
 Differences in adaptations 
 In the dub, the Nordic God Cards' attribute and types are the same as in the OCG/TCG. 
 Due to the dub skipping over ten episodes, the plot implies  Team New World  had always been in the  WRGP  (as opposed to a timeline change) and  Team Ragnarok  was the second opponent of  Team 5D's .
