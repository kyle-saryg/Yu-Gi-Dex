 Daigo Sorano  (空野大悟,  Sorano Daigo ) is the highest-ranking second-year  Obelisk Blue  student. He Duels  Jaden Yuki  in the Graduation Duel, and loses. After the Duel, he is defeated by  Trueman ; who uses his Deck and appearance in Duels against  Tyranno Hassleberry ,  Syrus Truesdale , among other Duel Academy students and lock them in  Nightshroud 's  World of Darkness . 
 It is revealed before Trueman Dueled Hassleberry while taking Sorano's form that Sorano was one of Hassleberry's first friends at the Academy.
 Sorano is most likely revived after Jaden reaches out to everyone trapped in the World of Darkness and helps them to escape by believing in their cards.
 
 Deck 
 Sorano uses a  Horus Decree Lock  Deck. His main strategy is bringing out " Horus the Black Flame Dragon LV8 " to the  field  as soon as possible so that way he can lockdown his opponent's  Spell Cards . He would then combine this with " Royal Decree " to prevent his opponent from  activating   Trap Cards , thereby leaving his opponents with almost no way out of the lockdown. If "Horus the Black Flame Dragon LV8" would be  destroyed , Sorano would use other cards to bring it back, so that way he can reenact his lockdown strategy. His strategies also involve using " Stop Defense " to forcibly switch his opponent's monsters into  Attack Position  so that way he can inflict as much  Battle Damage  to his opponent as possible.
