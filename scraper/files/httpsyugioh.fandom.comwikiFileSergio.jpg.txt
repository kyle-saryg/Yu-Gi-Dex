 Biography 
 Sergio is first seen when  Yusei Fudo  arrives to  Crash Town , as he and two other slaves are trying to escape from the mountain. However, they are unsuccessful, and two members from  Malcolm 's gang find them. Sergio then throws a pendant to the top of the cliff, which lands near Yusei. He is electrocuted several times by the members of Malcolm's gang, and is then dragged back to the mountain. [2] 
 Later fortunately, Sergio is reunited with his children,  West  and  Nico , and meets  Kalin Kessler . The four of them try to escape in a mine car. When pursuers from Malcolm's gang appear, he sacrifices himself to stop them by jumping to a track switch and using it to divert the gang members. Weakened by the shocks from his collar, he silently entrusts Kalin to protect his children, then loses his grip and falls into the abyss of the mines. [3]  In the dubbed version, he is not shown falling, and is implied to be still holding on. It seems that he would then be recaptured, and  Jack Atlas  later says that he was found and is fine.
 
 Non-canon appearances 
 In  Yu-Gi-Oh! 5D's World Championship 2011: Over the Nexus , Sergio survives his fall in the mines, but loses his memories afterwards. The  player  can help him by giving him his pendant from Nico and West, Sergio will then recover his memory and reunite with his family.
