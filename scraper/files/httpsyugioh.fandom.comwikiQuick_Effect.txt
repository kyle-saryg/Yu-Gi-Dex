 A  Quick Effect , formerly called a  Multi-Trigger Effect , and called an  Immediate Trigger Effect  ( 誘 発 即 時 効 果   Yūhatsu Sokuji Kōka ) in the  OCG , is a type of  monster effect  that is  Spell Speed 2  (and is the only Spell Speed 2 monster effect).
 It is the only type of monster effect that can be  activated  in  Summon negation window , and the only one that can be  chained  to another activation (excluding  SEGOC ). As such, monsters effects that  negate  the activation or  Summon  are all Quick Effects.
 For cards with  Problem-Solving Card Text  (PSCT), starting in  Maximum Crisis Special Edition , Quick Effects are noted by mention of " (Quick Effect) " in the text. Prior to  Maximum Crisis Special Edition , for cards with PSCT, Quick Effects are normally noted by " During either player's  [ turn / Phase / Step ]" in the activation timing, or " (this is a Quick Effect) " at the end of the effect if that wording is not applicable.
 For cards without PSCT, Quick Effects are more difficult to identify. They can be identified by text which indicates the same timing as the PSCT standard. Some Quick Effects can only be determined to be that way due to rulings.
 Unless otherwise specified (e.g. " Light and Darkness Dragon "), the same Quick Effect can be activated multiple times during the same Chain, as long as it meets its activation conditions and/or timing each time.

 Chain example 
 The player  controls  a  face-up  " Horus the Black Flame Dragon LV8 ", and it is currently the opponent's  Main Phase 1 .
 
 Chain Link  1: The opponent activates " Fissure ". 
 Chain Link 2: The player Chains " Horus the Black Flame Dragon LV8 "'s effect to negate its activation and destroy "Fissure". 
 Chain Link 3: The opponent Chains " Book of Moon ",  targeting  "Horus". 
 Chain Link 4: The player Chains " Horus the Black Flame Dragon LV8 "'s effect to negate its activation and destroy "Book of Moon. 
 Since Chains resolve backwards, this Chain would  resolve  as follows:
 
 Chain Link 4: " Horus the Black Flame Dragon LV8 " negates and destroys " Book of Moon ". 
 Chain Link 3: " Book of Moon " does not resolve. 
 Chain Link 2: " Horus the Black Flame Dragon LV8 " negates and destroys " Fissure ". 
 Chain Link 1: " Fissure " does not resolve.
