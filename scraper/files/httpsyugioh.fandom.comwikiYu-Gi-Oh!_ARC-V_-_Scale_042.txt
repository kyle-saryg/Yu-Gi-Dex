 Head-to-Head Cards!! 
 
 "Two G.O.D.'s!!"  is the forty-second chapter of the  Yu-Gi-Oh! ARC-V  manga .
 This chapter was first printed in January in the March 2019 issue of  V Jump , released on January 20, 2019.
 
 Summary 
 Yuya  resumes his battle against  Reiji , who uses his own  G.O.D. monster . Yuya remembers the message that his  father  conveyed to him, and alters the stage to amuse Reiji.
 
 Featured Duel: Yuya Sakaki vs. Reiji Akaba 
 Duel continues from the previous Scale . 
 Turn 3: Reiji 
Reiji uses the  effect  of " Divine Go-D/D/D Zero King Zero G.O.D. Reiji ", tributing three copies of " D/D Dog ", treating all of Yuya's cards as if they do not exist. "Divine Go-D/D/D Zero King Zero G.O.D. Reiji" attacks Yuya directly; its effect enables Reiji to reduce Yuya's  LP  to 0. Yuya activates the Pendulum effect of " EnterMate ClassiKuriboh ", tributing it to negate Reiji's  attack  and end the  Battle Phase .
 Turn 4: Yuya 
Yuya obtains an  Action Card . He summons " EnterMate Turntrooper " (1200/1200) and  sets  a card. " G.O.D.-Eyes Phantom Dragon " attacks "Divine Go-D/D/D Zero King Zero G.O.D. Reiji", and the battle causes "EnterMate Turntrooper" to gain one  counter . "Divine D/D/D Zero King Zero G.O.D. Reiji" loses 1000  ATK  for each monster used as a  tribute  to summon "G.O.D.-Eyes Phantom Dragon", and the latter gains that much ATK ("G.O.D.-Eyes Phantom Dragon": 3000 → 6000 ATK; "Divine Go-D/D/D Zero King Zero G.O.D. Reiji": 0 → 0 ATK). However, the effect of "DivineGo- D/D/D Zero King Zero G.O.D. Reiji" makes the ATK of any monster that battles it become 0 ("G.O.D.-Eyes Phantom Dragon": 3000 → 0 ATK).
 Since there is one counter on "EnterMate Turntrooper", Yuya negates this attack and his turn ends.
 Turn 5: Reiji 
Since the previous attack of "G.O.D.-Eyes Phantom Dragon" was negated, Reiji's turn is skipped and the turn moves to Yuya's next Battle Phase. 
 Turn 6: Yuya 
"G.O.D.-Eyes Phantom Dragon" attacks "Divine Go-D/D/D Zero King Zero G.O.D. Reiji", and the battle causes "EnterMate Turntrooper" to gain one counter. Since there are two counters on "EnterMate Turntrooper", Yuya activates its effect,  tributing  it to  banish  all monsters on the field for three turns.
 Duel continues in the next Scale .
