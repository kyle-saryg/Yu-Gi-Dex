 Prior events 
 Kokurano  claimed to be able to see the future. However, he would write as many predictions as possible down, hence increasing the probability of a small amount being correct and would only reveal the ones that came true afterwards and claim to have known they were going to happen all along. He also made his spoken predictions come true.
 He predicted that a wonderful man would reveal himself to  Anzu  and she would swoon before him in love. For  Yugi 's skepticism, he predicted that countless letters would fall and bring disaster on Yugi. He later pushed a bookcase on Yugi on the library to make this come true. However Yugi switched to  Dark Yugi , who realized what Kokurano was doing, and searched for Anzu.
 To make his prediction about Anzu come true, Kokurano used chloroform to make her swoon. Dark Yugi then confronted Kokurano and challenged him to the Shadow Game.
 
 The game 
       The bottles hanging from the ceiling.     
 The rules were:
 
 5 strings were connected to a clock. Each string connected to a chloroform bottle. 
 Each minute the minute hand would cut a string, causing a bottle to fall. 
 Each player would take turns catching the falling bottle. 
 It was not known which string was connected to which bottle. 
 The first bottle dropped and  Dark Yugi  caught it. The second bottle dropped and  Kokurano  caught it. Kokurano tried preventing Dark Yugi from catching the third bottle, by tripping him, but Dark Yugi still barely stopped the bottle by throwing the  Millenium Puzzle  at it. The fourth bottle then dropped and Kokurano failed to catch it, causing the chloroform to knock him unconscious.
 
 Aftermath 
 Lying unconscious, Kokurano numerous false prediction notes were exposed, letting people see he was a fraud.
 While Dark Yugi carried the sleeping  Anzu , she partly woke up long enough to see a cut on her rescuer's hand. Later she saw the same cut on  Yugi 's hand and wondered if it could have been him that saved her.
