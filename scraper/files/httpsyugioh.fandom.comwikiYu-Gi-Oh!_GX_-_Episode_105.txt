 Summary 
 This episode features no Duels, and serves as a recap of Season 2. At the end of the episode,  Chancellor Sheppard  remarks how much  Jaden Yuki  has grown during the last two years, and believes that  Thelonious Viper  will be able to help him release his true abilities.
 
 Trivia 
 When  Jaden  says to  Hassleberry  that Neos thanks him for his help, Hassleberry thinks Jaden is crazy and replies with some ununderstandable words, which he explains to Syrus that it's a supposed alien language, he makes the 'Live Long and Prosper' gesture used by Spock from Star Trek. 
 Hassleberry says Nanu-Nanu as a reference to Robin Williams' catchphrase from the 80s sitcom Mork and Mindy. 
 Errors 
 In the dub, Hassleberry was surprised to see Blair; however, he hadn't met her before that point. In the original, he asked Chazz who she was.

 Differences in Adaption 
 Cut from the dub was the scene where  Chazz  discovered  Blair  was in his room: the reason it was cut was because he ended up walking in on her in his hot spring bath.
