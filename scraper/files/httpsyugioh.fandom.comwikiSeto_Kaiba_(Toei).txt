 Biography 
 Death-T  was a "theme park" created by Seto Kaiba in-order to kill  Yugi Mutou . He made this after he tied his first duel with Yugi Motou. Kaiba invited Yugi and his friends to the  Death-T  theme park. When Yugi arrived, he found out that Kaiba's men had kidnapped Yugi's grandfather,  Sugoroku Mutou . He then challenged Yugi's grandfather to a Duel, which Kaiba won. He punished Yugi's grandfather with a  Penalty Game , creating virtual holograms of 3 " Blue-Eyes White Dragons ". Solomon received too much of a shock from the holograms, rendering him unconscious.
 Yugi swore to avenge his grandfather. He had to battle his way up to the top levels (Death-T 4 and 5) where Kaiba was waiting along with his brother,  Mokuba . Yugi managed to get to the top level, but before dueling Kaiba, he had to defeat Mokuba in a game of  Capsule Monster Chess . Yugi won and then started his Duel with Seto Kaiba. He managed to defeat Kaiba with the five pieces of " Exodia ". As a  Penalty Game  for Kaiba, Yugi shattered his evil soul using the " Mind Crush " Penalty Game.
