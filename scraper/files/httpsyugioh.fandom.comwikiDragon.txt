 Dragon  (ドラゴン  Doragon ) is a  Type  of  Monster  representing mythological serpentine, reptile, avian like beings that are typically fire-breathing creatures that symbolize chaos, brutality, fierceness and intimidation.
 Dragons tend to be the strongest or key boss monster in numerous Deck types in addition one of the most established and powerful Monster Types in the entire franchise. Ever since the inception of the  Yu-Gi-Oh! Trading Card  franchise, Dragon monsters have been known for having an ATK power greater than any other type of monster in the game in addition to being one of the most popular monster Types.
 In most of the  Yu-Gi-Oh!  anime and manga series, the rivals of the main characters' all use Dragon-Type monsters as their signature or boss monsters, and to varying degrees in their Decks.  Seto Kaiba  employs his signature " Blue-Eyes White Dragon " as a key boss monster while his deck in the later part of the anime incorporates a variety of Dragons such as  Spear Dragon ,  Different Dimension Dragon ,  Paladin of White Dragon  and the  Chaos Emperor Dragon .  Chazz Princeton  uses " Armed Dragon "s as a core part of his Deck in the anime, and a Dragon Deck in the manga spearheaded by " Light and Darkness Dragon ".  Jack Atlas 's Turbo Deck is based on summoning his " Red Dragon Archfiend " while his Ground Deck also plays numerous Dragons such as " Strong Wind Dragon ", " Vice Dragon ", and " Exploder Dragonwing ".  Kite Tenjo  uses " Galaxy-Eyes Photon Dragon ", in addition to some minor Dragon monsters.
 Curiously enough, this tradition was inverted in the fifth series, and the protagonist  Yuya Sakaki ,  along   with   his   counterparts , is the one who  uses Dragons , primarily " Odd-Eyes Pendulum Dragon "; his main rival  Declan Akaba  uses no Dragons whatsoever.  Yusei Fudo , despite being a protagonist, also  uses a Dragon-Type  as his " ace " monster.  Varis  primarily uses a " Rokket " Deck, which uses Dragon monsters, and all of his ace monsters are Dragons as well, albeit dressed in a gun and ammunition theme such as " Borreload Dragon ".
 Lucidien Kallister  uses dragons as his core focus of his deck incorporating sevel powerful dragons with his main ace monster throughout the series being  Rush Dragon Dragears. 
 There are Dragon-Type Monsters for every Attribute (except  DIVINE , even though all  Divine-Beast -Type monsters except " Obelisk the Tormentor " are referred to as dragons).
 There are six  Structure Decks  focused on Dragon-Type monsters:  Dragon's Roar ,  Rise of the Dragon Lords ,  Dragunity Legion ,  Dragons Collide ,  Saga of Blue-Eyes White Dragon , and  Rise of the True Dragons . (In the OCG, they are  Dragon's Roar ,  Revival of the Great Dragon ,  Dragunity Drive ,  Dragonic Legion ,  The Blue-Eyed Dragon's Thundering Descent ,  Revival of the Great Divine Dragon , Structure Deck: Rokket Revolt , and  Structure Deck R: Dragunity Drive . 
 " Dragon Ruler " is one of the most powerful series in the game; even after becoming Limited on the  January 2014 Lists , they were still a power to be reckoned with, as each dragon could offer support to Decks of its corresponding Attribute, giving them more consistency. The release of "Number 95: Galaxy-Eyes Dark Matter Dragon" sealed their destiny and made them become Forbidden.
 For some reasons, artists who create monsters' design are usually drawing dragons bipedal: on most arts, dragons' rear limbs resemble actual hands, being weaker than legs but long and strong enough. Some Dragon monsters like "Dragonic Slayer" are being even shown with a sword wielded in hands.
 Many multi-Type archetypes have a Dragon-Type monster as their trump card, such as:
 
 " Crystal Beast ": " Rainbow Dragon " 
 " Ice Barrier ": " Trishula, Dragon of the Ice Barrier " 
 " Infernity ": " Infernity Doom Dragon " 
 " Iron Chain ": " Iron Chain Dragon " 
 " Koa'ki Meiru ": " Koa'ki Meiru Maximus " 
 " Lightsworn ": " Judgment Dragon " 
 " Scrap ": " Scrap Dragon " 
 " Utopia ": " Number 99: Utopic Dragon " 
 " Cipher ": " Galaxy-Eyes Cipher Dragon " 
 " Fur Hire ": " Rafale, Champion Fur Hire "

 Dragon-focused Decks 
 "LV" Dragon Decks 
 Some dragon Decks are based on the "LV" Dragons, " Armed Dragon " and " Horus the Black Flame Dragon ". These Decks usually focus on leveling up their monsters quickly. To protect the high level monsters from Trap Cards, " Royal Decree ", " Jinzo ", "Trap Stun", "Mirage Dragon" or " King Dragun " are used. " Horus the Black Flame Dragon " has added protection from Spell Cards and is well known for the infamous "Horus Decree" lockdown. "Horus" and "Armed Dragon" cards can even be combined to make a Deck that not only locks down Spell and Trap Cards, but also controls the opponent's monsters that may get in your way.
 
 Dragon Fusion Decks 
 These types of Decks often focus on getting Fusion Monsters like " Five-Headed Dragon ", " King Dragun ", " Blue-Eyes Ultimate Dragon ", and sometimes even " Dragon Master Knight " or  Blue-Eyes Shining Dragon  to the field. Usually " Dragon's Mirror " or " Future Fusion " is used to accomplish these tasks. If you want to summon " King Dragun " quickly, " The Dark - Hex-Sealed Fusion ", along with other substitute Fusion-Material monsters, can be of great help.
 
 Chaos Dragon 
 Main article:  Chaos Dragon Deck 
 One of the more popular builds in the game, this deck utilizes a combination of  Chaos  monsters and " Red-Eyes Darkness Metal Dragon ". This build focuses on getting out "Red-Eyes Darkness Metal Dragon", " Lightpulsar Dragon ", and " Chaos Sorcerer "/" Black Luster Soldier - Envoy of the Beginning "; its main offensive strategy relies on banishing opposing cards or banishing its own cards in order to Special Summon its key monsters. One can use " Raiden, Hand of the Lightsworn ", " Lyla, Lightsworn Sorceress ", " Card Trooper " and " Darkflare Dragon " to send monsters to the Graveyard to summon "Lightpulsar Dragon", or to speed up the setups for summoning both " Dark Armed Dragon " and/or "Black Luster Soldier  - Envoy of the Beginning". If played correctly, this deck is capable of Special Summoning its most powerful monsters within a few turns.
 This deck relies heavily on Special Summoning powerful monsters with devastating effects in order to overpower and OTK the opponent. The deck can also create Level 8 Synchro monsters consistently due to the synergy of " White Dragon Wyverburster ", " Black Dragon Collapserpent ", "Raiden, Hand of the Lightsworn" and " Plaguespreader Zombie ". "Lightpulsar Dragon", " Caius the Shadow Monarch ", and "Chaos Sorcerer" also open up Rank 6 plays after their effects are used.
 
 Dragon Revival 
 Perhaps the easiest way to play Dragons, this deck focuses on sending powerful Dragons to the Graveyard with cards such as " Dragon Ravine "/" Dragon Shrine " and " Number 95: Galaxy-Eyes Dark Matter Dragon ", then proceeding to revive them with cards such as " Soul Charge " and " Return of the Dragon Lords ". Many support cards for this deck exclusively support  Normal Monsters , as a result, it is often best to play this deck with  Dragon -Type  Normal Monsters . Due to the extreme ease with which a player can swarm the field with high-level dragons,  Xyz Monsters  (Rank 7-8) are highly recommended in this deck. Cards such as  Decoy Dragon  and  Red-Eyes Darkness Metal Dragon  are useful as both can summon any Level 7 or higher Dragon-Type monster from your Graveyard.
