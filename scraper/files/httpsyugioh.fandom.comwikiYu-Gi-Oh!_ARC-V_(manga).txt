 Trivia 
 The plot of the manga series is based on Judeo-Christian Symbolism:
 The ultimate objective of the protagonists is to find a card whose name can be shortened to "GOD" and has the power to decide the fate of the world. 
 Awakening "GOD" requires the use of The Adam Factor and The Eve Factor, named after the first humans in the Bible who were created so that they may "know God". 
 The main antagonist's name is "Eve", who caused the fall of mankind by disobeying god. 
 "GOD" came from the space between dimensions and thus outside of space and time.
 This is more a reference to modern Christianity than anything from the Bible, in which God was thought to dwell in the sky and was written during a time when the sky was as unknowable to people of that era as the space beyond our universe is to us.
