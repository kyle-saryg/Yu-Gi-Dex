 Appearance 
       Full body view of Pierre.     
 Pierre is a short teenager, who wears a blue buttoned suit with orange stars on his arms, a white shirt underneath and a red ribbon tied on his neck. He also wears yellow pants support by two green suspenders, with a belt tying them together at the knees. Pierre also wears orange boots that have question marks printed on them. His hair is mostly purple but with a blond strand shaped like a "Q". Pierre has brown eyes.
 Together, Pierre's hair, ribbon and pants form a motif shaped like "Q & A" (question and answer), fitting his quiz theme.
 
 Personality 
 Pierre is very arrogant, vain and rude. He believes himself supreme and perfect because of his great intellect. He laughs and belittles those that cannot answer quizzes properly, or that have no talents at some fields of knowledge, proudly declaring himself flawless. He tends to speak in Quiz jargon using the terms "correct" and "incorrect" while constantly speaking like asking quizzes. He also shows a constant penchant for mockery and often mixes quiz questions with verbal insults. 
 His overconfidence is his main weakness because during his duel with Yuya, he thought he would defeat him because he had every answer in every question in the action field " Quiz Quest  ". But he forgot this is a duel not a quiz. After he lost the duel against Yuya, he became more humble and realized, he has more things to learn.
 
 Etymology 
 Eita's name (in Japanese order, with the family name before the given name) forms "Q & A" ( Kyū - andō   Ei ta), referring to Eita's "Quiz" theme. His dub name is French for Peter the Superior, an appropriate name given his vanity.
 
 Voice/ Mannerisms 
 In the dub, Pierre speaks with a French accent.
 
 Biography 
 Pre Arc League Championship 
 Pierre was first seen on a game show, showing off his smarts. After answering some questions correctly, he stated that he studied a lot and that an individual must have knowledge, especially as a Duelist. Yuya arrived at the quiz boy's Dueling School and Dueled him. Pierre managed to get 2300 LP in his Duel thanks to some Action cards and mocked Yuya for his lack of knowledge of simple things and Dueling skills. Pierre lost the Duel, even with his own gameplay. He became upset and stated," Perhaps there are a few more things that I have to learn."
 
 Duel Academy 
 After  Z-ARC 's defeat and the  Standard Dimension  being reborn into the  "Pendulum Dimension" , Pierre is seen watching  Yuya 's Duel against  Jack Atlas . [1]  He applauded when Yuya won and watched Yuya and  Declan 's  Action Duel . [2]  He was happy when Yuya won the Duel and witnessed  Zuzu Boyle 's revival. [3] 
 
 Deck 
 Pierre uses a  " Quiz " Deck . He supports his deck with cards that demand the opponent to respond questions correctly, otherwise they are punished, so he also uses cards to modify the results to ensure the opponent is always incorrect. He also takes advantage of the  Field Spell   Quiz Quest , easily responding the questions of its  Action Cards  to gain a large amount of Life Points.
