 Gameplay 
 Like the Nintendo DS and GBA games, the Tag Force games involve free-roaming open worlds based on the settings they take place in ( Duel Academy / New Domino City ) and "Free Duel" mode. Duels can be played in tag-team or single mode. Characters from the series the game is set in can be opponent's and stories. Also unlike the DS 5D's games, the Tag Force games do not have  Turbo Duels .
 
 Anime-exclusive cards 
 In all  Tag Force  games, there are some anime-exclusive cards unique to each individual  Tag Force  game, although it is possible for  GX  anime cards from previous games to appear in the later  5D's Tag Force  games by UMD recognition or importing Decks from previous games.  Yu-Gi-Oh! ARC-V Tag Force Special  contains all anime-exclusive cards from previous  Tag Force  games and  Yu-Gi-Oh! ZEXAL World Duel Carnival , but no new exclusive cards of its own.
 
 Field Spell animation 
 In all  Tag Force  games, when activated  Field Spell Cards  are rendered in animated 3D based on their own artwork, unlike other  Yu-Gi-Oh!  games. The latest game,  Tag Force Special , does not include this feature.
 
 Voice acting 
 In the Japanese versions of the  Tag Force  games, all characters except cosplaying characters have voice performances while dueling.
