 Summary 
 In the the  Duel ,  Yugi  and  Joey  bring out their strongest  monsters , but the  Paradox Brothers  use " Magical Labyrinth " to change the shape of the maze and separate their monsters. The Paradox Brothers manage to  draw  all three pieces of " Gate Guardian " (" Kazejin ", " Suijin " and " Sanga of the Thunder "), their most powerful monster.
 Meanwhile, as  Seto Kaiba  approaches  Pegasus 's  castle , he is confronted by  Kemo , but Kaiba overpowers him and takes him hostage, demanding that he take him to  Mokuba . Kemo takes Kaiba through Pegasus' underground prison, but activates an alarm, forcing Kaiba to flee and find Mokuba himself.
 
 Featured Duel: Yami Yugi & Joey Wheeler vs. Para & Dox 
 
 This article  may require  cleanup  to meet this wiki's standards.   You can help out by re-organizing or re-writing parts of it or checking grammar and spelling.   
 
 This Duel uses  Duelist Kingdom  gameplay. Rules and  card effects  may differ from that of the  TCG / OCG . See the individual card articles for more information.     
 Duel continues from the previous episode . 
 Yugi  has 1600  LP  remaining, and  controls  " Celtic Guardian " (1400/1200) in  Attack Position  and no  Set  cards. 
 Joey Wheeler  has 2000 LP remaining and controls " Axe Raider " (2200/1150) in Attack Position  equipped  with " Kunai with Chain " and no Set cards. 
 Para  has 1700 LP remaining, and controls no  monsters  or Set cards. 
 Dox  has 2000 LP remaining, and controls " Labyrinth Tank " (2400/2400) in Attack Position, " Labyrinth Wall ", and 1 Set card (" Jirai Gumo ").
 Turn 8: Joey 
Joey draws " Flame Swordsman " and subsequently Normal Summons it (1800/1600) in Attack Position. Since "Flame Swordsman" is a  Level  5 monster, Joey can move it up to 5 spaces, but he chooses to move it only 4 spaces inside the maze, arriving at the same space as "Celtic Guardian". He then moves "Axe Raider" inside the maze. Since it is a Level 4 monster, he moves it 4 spaces, joining "Flame Swordsman" and "Celtic Guardian".
 Turn 9: Dox 
Dox draws. He then moves "Labyrinth Tank" another 7 spaces.
 Turn 10: Yami Yugi 
Yugi draws. He then Normal Summons " Dark Magician " (2500/2100) in Attack Position. Since it is a Level 7 monster, Yugi can move it up to 7 spaces, but he chooses to move it only 5 spaces inside the maze, in front of "Celtic Guardian" and Joey's monsters.
 Turn 11: Para 
Para draws " Magical Labyrinth " and subsequently  activates  it to change the shape of "Labyrinth Wall" maze. "Flame Swordsman" and "Axe Raider" are separated from "Celtic Guardian" and "Dark Magician".
 Turn 12: Joey 
Joey draws. He then moves "Flame Swordsman" and "Axe Raider" ahead, but "Axe Raider" steps on the space of "Jirai Gumo", causing it to appear on the field. " Jirai Gumo " (2100/1000) is in Attack Position and  attacks  "Axe Raider". Due to the  effect  of "Jirai Gumo", the  ATK  of "Axe Raider" becomes its  original ATK  during the  Damage Step  ("Axe Raider": 2200 → 1700/1150). "Jirai Gumo" destroys "Axe Raider" (Joey: 2000 → 1600 LP).
 Turn 13: Dox 
Dox draws. He then moves "Labyrinth Tank" another 7 spaces, arriving right behind "Jirai Gumo". He then Sets " Dungeon Worm ".
 Turn 14: Yami Yugi 
Yugi draws " Mystic Box " and subsequently activates it to force "Jirai Gumo" and "Dark Magician" to swap locations, and to destroy "Jirai Gumo". "Dark Magician" attacks and destroys "Labyrinth Tank" (Dox: 2000 → 1900 LP).
 Turn 15: Para 
Para draws " Sanga of the Thunder " and subsequently Sets it.
 Turn 16: Joey 
Joey draws. He then moves "Flame Swordsman" five spaces.
 Turn 17: Dox 
Dox draws " Suijin " and subsequently Sets it. He then  Flip Summons  "Dungeon Worm" (1800/1500) to Attack Position. He then activates " Invigoration " and equips it to "Dungeon Worm", increasing its ATK by 400 and decreasing its  DEF  by 200 ("Dungeon Worm": 1800 → 2200/1500 → 1300). Since it's a burrower, "Dungeon Worm" is able to move freely under the maze, bypassing the spaces and attacking any monster. "Dungeon Worm" attacks and destroys "Celtic Guardian" (Yugi: 1600 → 800 LP). "Dungeon Worm" then retreats underground.
 Turn 18: Yami Yugi 
Yugi draws. He then activates " Magical Hats ", hiding "Dark Magician" and "Flame Swordsman" under two of the four "Hats".
 Turn 19: Para 
Para draws. He then Normal Summons " Monster Tamer " (1800/1600) in Attack Position. Due to the effect of "Monster Tamer", Para can take control of Dox's "Dungeon Worm" and increase its ATK by 600 ("Dungeon Worm": 2200 → 2800/1300). "Dungeon Worm" attacks and destroys a "Hat", which is revealed to be empty. "Dungeon Worm" then retreats underground.
 Turn 20: Joey 
Joey draws. He then releases his "Flame Swordsman" from the "Hat" it was under. He then activates " Salamandra " and equips it to "Flame Swordsman", increasing its ATK by 700 ("Flame Swordsman": 1800 → 2500/1600). "Flame Swordsman" attacks "Dungeon Worm". The Salamandra attack steers itself into the destroyed hat and down the tunnels, allowing "Flame Swordsman" to attack without moving and strike an underground monster. Also, since "Dungeon Worm" is weak against  FIRE - Attribute  monsters, it loses the ATK bonus from "Monster Tamer" ("Dungeon Worm": 2800 → 2200/1300). "Flame Swordsman" destroys "Dungeon Worm" (Dox: 1900 → 1600 LP).
 Turn 21: Dox 
Dox draws " Kazejin " and subsequently Normal Summons it (2400/2200) in Attack Position. He then Flip Summons " Suijin " (2500/2400) and " Sanga of the Thunder " (2600/2200) and  combines  them with "Kazejin" in order to  form  " Gate Guardian " in Attack Position.
 Turn 22: Yami Yugi 
Yugi draws. He then Sets two cards.
 Turn 23: Para 
"Sanga of the Thunder" attacks "Flame Swordsman".
 Duel continues in the next episode . 
 
 Differences in adaptations 
 The gun in  Kemo 's hand is erased from the dub. Kaiba had used a  Gyakutenno Megami  card to jam the hammer and stop it from firing.
 Due to this, most of the fight between Kaiba and Kemo is also cut out from the dub. 
 Shots of the Paradox Brothers are changed to show them talking in the US version. In the Japanese, they're just standing there looking fierce. 
 In the dub, a spider graphic was added to the square Axe Raider steps on. 
 Mystic Box has a slightly different image in the dub. 
 A shot is changed in the dub to show the " Jirai Gumo " card being pierced by swords, rather than the monster itself. 
 In the original Japanese version, Monster Tamer speaks, saying "Dungeon Worm, come on!" so Dungeon Worm can attack. In the dub, Monster Tamer doesn't speak, and only grunts. 
 Mistakes 
 When Celtic Guardian gets destroyed by Dungeon Worm, Joey shouts, "No, my Celtic Guardian!" when Celtic Guardian is actually Yugi's monster, not Joey's. 
 When " Monster Tamer " is Summoned, the graphic shows it with 1500 DEF when in both versions its card has 1600 DEF.
