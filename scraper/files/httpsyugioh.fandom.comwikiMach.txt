 Biography 
 History 
       Mach as a Pegasus.     
 In the distant past, Mach was a pegasus who served a knight, later revealed to be  Dumon . When  Vector  attacked the  United Lands of the Poseidon Ocean  he  offered a blood sacrifice to  Abyss Splash the Roaring Waterfall Deity  in order to finish the battle after his  Gorgonic Guardians  were destroyed.  Rio Kastle  offered herself as a sacrifice seemingly to Abyss and Sir Dumon riding on Mach attempted to save her, although Princess Rio actually sacrificed herself to revive  another god . [1] 
 Later, three knights who lived in Dumon's land were manipulated by  Don Thousand [2]  and attempted to usurp the King, but were intercepted by Mach and Dumon. Since the hero was unwilling to kill his former comrades, both master and steed were eventually defeated and killed. However, Dumon's fellow knights regretted their actions and they buried him and Mach together. Mach later became the " Number " spirit  of " Number 44: Sky Pegasus ", while his master was reborn as a  Barian . [3] 
 
 Yu-Gi-Oh! ZEXAL II 
       Mach vs. Yuma.     
 Upon entering the first  set of ruins ,  Yuma  was separated from  Shark  and the mysterious boy, " Nash " who he saved earlier. After exploring the temple further, Yuma was confronted by Mach before he could grab the Sacred " Number " card that was contained in the Ruin. Mach then began a Duel with Yuma with Shark's and "Nash's" lives on the line. [4]  As the Duel continued, Shark and "Nash" eventually ended up finding runes which explained Mach's story and its relevance to his Duel strategy, which enabled Yuma to win the Duel. Afterwards, Mach entrusted Yuma with his "Number" card before disappearing. [3] 
 
 Deck 
 Mach uses a  " Druid " Deck  focusing on the effects " Labyrinth of Decisions " and " Unfair Treaty ", which forces his opponent to  pay  the  cost  of "Labyrinth", which can lower  Life Points  very quickly when used with the  effect  of his " Number ", while also eliminating the cards in his opponent's  hand .
