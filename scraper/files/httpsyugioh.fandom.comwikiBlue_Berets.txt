      Blue Berets.     
 The  Blue Berets  are a team of  Obelisk Blue  students organized by  Axel Brodie  while  Duel Academy  was transported to the  alternate dimension  at the hands of  Yubel . They were used to combat  the  Duel Ghouls  that have been transformed at the hands of Yubel. When they tried to get to the academy's tennis courts so they could construct a portal to get back home,  Vellian Crowler  borrowed them to combat some Duel Ghouls blocking their way. Unfortunately, they, along with Crowler, turned into Duel Ghouls themselves. They were turned back to normal after  Jesse Anderson  used the " Rainbow Dragon " card to bring the Academy back to Earth.
 The name of the name references the  Green Berets , the elite special forces division of the United States Army.
