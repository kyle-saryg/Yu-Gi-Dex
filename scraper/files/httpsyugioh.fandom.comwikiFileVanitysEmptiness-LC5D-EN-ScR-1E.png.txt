 Trap Cards  (Japanese:  罠 カード  Torappu Kādo ) are cards with purple-colored borders that have various effects. A Trap Card must first be  Set  and can only be  activated  after the current  turn  has finished. After that, it may be activated during either player's turn. Trap Cards are  Spell Speed 2 , with the exception of  Counter Trap Cards , which are  Spell Speed 3 .
 Trap Cards may be chained to  Spell Cards , other Trap Cards, or to the effects of  Effect Monsters .
 Normal Trap Cards  are Spell Speed 2. They can be activated during either player's turn as long as it wasn't set that turn. The effects of certain Normal Trap Cards behave like  Equip Cards , but the card is still considered a Normal Trap Card.
 Continuous Trap Cards  are also Spell Speed 2. Their effects are applied as long as they are face-up on the field.
 Counter Trap Cards are a Spell Speed 3. Only other Counter Trap Cards can be  chained  to a Counter Trap Card.
 In  Turbo Duels  during the  Yu-Gi-Oh! 5D's  anime, because the use of non- Speed Spell  Spell Cards is restricted, duelists generally have a higher amount of Trap Cards in their Decks.
 There are some exceptions on activating Trap Cards, some cards  allow Trap Cards to be activated during the turn it's set  or even  from the hand .
 
 Types 
 Normal Traps , which have no symbol on printed cards. Some video games use an empty symbol in menus for filtering and sorting cards.  
 Continuous Traps , which have an  infinity symbol .  
 Counter Traps , which have a curved arrow symbol.  
 Equip Traps ,  Yu-Gi-Oh! R  manga only. 
 Field Traps ,  Yu-Gi-Oh! R  manga only.
