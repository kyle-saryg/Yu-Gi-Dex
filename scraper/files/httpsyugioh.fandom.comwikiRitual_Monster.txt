 Ritual Monsters  (Japanese:  儀 式 モンスター  Gishiki Monsutā ), colored blue, are  monsters  that must be  Special Summoned  with a  Ritual Spell Card . Examples include " Relinquished ", " Magician of Black Chaos ", " Revendread Slayer ", " Nekroz of Trishula ", and " Herald of Ultimateness ".
 Ritual Monsters are  Special Summon-only monsters . This means that they cannot be  Normal Summoned  or  Tribute Summoned  from the  hand  and cannot be Special Summoned from the  Graveyard  or while  banished  unless they were first Ritual Summoned (even with a card like " Fulfillment of the Contract ").

 Ritual Summoning 
 Main article:  Ritual Summon 
 In some ways, Level 5 or higher Ritual Monsters are easier to Summon than  Normal  or  Effect Monsters  of the same Level, since their Tributes do not need to be on the field. However, they do require a number of specific cards to be in the hand at once, which can be quite difficult to achieve. Some  Ritual Spell Cards  such as " Advanced Ritual Art " can ameliorate this by using monsters from the Main Deck instead, as opposed to using monsters from your hand and/or side of the field. Cards such as " Preparation of Rites " and " Manju of the Ten Thousand Hands " help the player to assemble the necessary components for a Ritual Summon, while cards such as " Ascending Soul " and " Ritual Buster " help alleviate the costs of Ritual Summoning. The " Djinn of Rituals " monsters can serve dual purposes, as they make the Ritual Spell Card's monster requirement easier to fulfill by banishing themselves from the Graveyard, as well as granting an additional effect when used for the Ritual Summon of a Ritual Monster.
 
 Playing style 
 Because Ritual Monsters are not stored in the  Extra Deck , they don't have the benefit of being immediately available to be Summoned as soon as the player has the necessary monsters. Likewise, needing specific Spell Cards for each Ritual Monster (with some exceptions) can also limit the player's ability to Ritual Summon should they be missing the Ritual Spell Card or Ritual Monster. As a result, Decks focused on Ritual Summoning tend include ways to search Ritual Monsters and Ritual Spell Cards.  
 Ritual Summoning is supported by a number of Spell Cards, including " Ritual Foregone " which allows for the instant Summon of a Ritual Monster from the hand, though such a monster cannot attack and will be destroyed during the  End Phase . Generic search cards such as  Preparation of Rites ,  Pre-Preparation of Rites , and  Manju of the Ten Thousand Hands  are a common sight in Ritual-based strategies for their ability to easily set up a Ritual Summon, tributes notwithstanding.  
 The Impcantations are the best support for any Ritual based Deck to date; notably " Impcantation Talismandra " and " Impcantation Chalislime ". By helping to search the Ritual Monsters and Ritual Spells, and by Special Summoning themselves to the field, they can easily meet the requirements for a Ritual Summon. Overall, they give all Ritual-reliant decks some much-needed consistency. 
 No other Tributes are required if using " Ritual Raven " for the Summoning of a  DARK  Ritual Monster. Two of the "Gishki" archetype monsters, " Gishki Shadow " and " Gishki Vision " allow them to be the entire Tribute for any WATER monster, not just a "Gishki" Ritual Monster. 
 Ritual-reliant Decks benefit the most from having multiple copies of Ritual Spell Cards and Ritual Monsters, as the chances of drawing both the Ritual Spell and the Ritual Monster increases greatly. Ritual Summoning can cost the player a large amount of cards in hand/field so ways to generate hand advantage and recycle Ritual Spell cards are also important.
 With the introduction of the  New Master Rules , Ritual Monsters now have the advantage of being able to be Summoned in any  Main Monster Zone , unlike  Pendulum  and  Link Monsters .
 
 In the anime 
 Ritual Monsters have never been one of the major mechanics in the anime. A few prominent characters used Ritual Monsters in  Yu-Gi-Oh  and  Yu-Gi-Oh! GX , including  Yugi Muto ,  Joey Wheeler ,  Seto Kaiba ,  Maximillion Pegasus , and  Bastion Misawa , but they were never featured as prominently as Fusion Monsters in  GX . However, it should be noted that  Alexis Rhodes , with her  Cyber Angel  archetype, was the first character to use Ritual Summoning as her primary form of Special Summoning as opposed to an auxiliary form like the aforementioned characters.  Kite Tenjo  used a Ritual Monster in  Yu-Gi-Oh! ZEXAL , but that was the only time Ritual Monsters were featured in the entirety of  ZEXAL . Even in  Yu-Gi-Oh! ARC-V , which tried to show off all of the Summoning methods, Ritual Monsters were only used by two characters,  Alexis Rhodes  and  Aura Sentia , neither of whom were featured significantly in the anime.
 In  Yu-Gi-Oh! VRAINS ,  Yusaku Fujiki  became the first main protagonist since Yugi to utilize Ritual Summoning.

 Trivia 
 Ritual Monsters have the fewest number of anti-support cards of all monster  card types , with only 12 card specifically designed to stop them: " Brutal Beast Battle ", " The Bystial Alba Los ", " Bystial Baldrake ", " Dimensional Barrier ", " Forbidden Arts of the Gishki ", " Heritage of the Light ", " Inspector Boarder ", " Invincibility Barrier ", " Ritual Sealing ", " Simul Archfiends ", " Sophia, Goddess of Rebirth ", " Steelswarm Sting ". 
 " Blue-Eyes Chaos MAX Dragon " has the highest ATK of all Ritual Monsters. 
 Yugi Muto  and  Yusaku Fujiki  are the only main protagonists to use Ritual Monsters. 
 With only 109 different Monsters Ritual Monsters are, by far, the  Monster Card  with the lowest card count in the Yu-Gi-Oh! Trading Card Game.
