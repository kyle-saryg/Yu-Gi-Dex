 Summary 
 Shark  awakens in the hospital and looks out the window, seeing the  Duel Tower  with the  Sphere Field  atop it. He mutters  Yuma 's name.  Vetrix  tells Yuma he has to praise him for once, impressed that he evaded that attack. However, he adds that this is as far as Yuma will get. He asks if the " ZW - " card wasn't his trump card. With that defeated, he'll have no chance of winning. Yuma tells him he won't give up - not until he's delivered the feelings everyone has entrusted him with to Vetrix, at least. Vetrix  draws  and tells Yuma this is the end for him. He  activates  the  effect  that " Number 69: Heraldry Crest " stole from " Chaos Number 39: Utopia Ray ",  detaching  an  Overlay Unit  to increase the  ATK  of "Heraldry Crest" by 500 and decrease the ATK of "Utopia Ray" by 1000. He asks Yuma to allow him to exterminate him using the effect of "Utopia Ray". 
 
       The force of  Vetrix 's strike knocks  Yuma  to the edge of the  Sphere Field .     
 Vetrix declares " Dark Matter Demolition " as "Heraldry Crest"  attacks . It fires a beam into a portal, which exits the portal as a purple fireball. Yuma activates his  face-down  " Half Unbreak ", encasing "Utopia Ray" in a bubble, preventing its  destruction   by battle  and halving the  Battle Damage . Yuma is pitched against the edge of the Sphere Field by the force of the attack, but survives with 50  Life Points .  Tori  yells Yuma's name, while  Flip  says he has only 50 Life Points left. Vetrix calls Yuma troublesome, with Yuma insisting it's not over yet. Vetrix derides him, saying that his persistence reminds of him of  Kazuma  - and that was an aspect of Kazuma that Vetrix considered to be truly annoying. Yuma angrily yells he won't allow Vetrix to insult his father.
 Astral  urges him to calm down and reveals that he sees the winning formula. Vetrix asks Astral if he thinks they'll win just because "Heraldry Crest" is out of Overlay Units. He activates the effect of the " Heraldic Beast Twin-Headed Eagle " in his  Graveyard ,  banishing  it to  attach  two monsters from his Graveyard to "Heraldry Crest" as Overlay Units. Two spheres spring from a portal and begin to circle "Heraldry Crest". Vetrix says the time has come for them to give up,  Sets  a card and ends his  turn .  Bronk  remarks it's now 3800 Life Points to 50 and Flip adds that Yuma is no match for that.  Caswell  wonders if Yuma will really lose and Tori mutters Yuma's name. Vetrix laughs, while Yuma says the situation has really gotten bad now. 
 
       Yuma shares the Duel rice with  Astral .     
 Appearing bent over in pain, Astral asks Yuma what's wrong, as Yuma's stomach growls. He says he's really hungry and Astral asks how he can think of something like that right now. He remembers Tori giving him some Duel rice. He digs it out and starts eating. Flip wonders what he's doing and Caswell asks if this means he's forfeiting the Duel.  Cathy  says he couldn't do something like that and Bronk adds that he's not given up yet. Tori urges him on. Vetrix laughs, not expecting that even someone like Yuma would eat during a Duel (This scene is cut from the dub). Since Yuma and Astral are fused, it's as if Astral is also eating the rice. It's an unfamiliar feeling for Astral, who says he can feel the fighting spirit bursting in his body. Astral comments that this must be what it feels like to be truly alive and says it's fun to stay with Yuma. Yuma tells him they must win, but Astral is still focused on food, saying he'd like to have three bowls of rice next time to feel more alive (in the dub, Astral says that Yuma has an appetite for enjoying life). Finally, he refocuses and tells Yuma he has the winning formula.
 
       " Number C39: Utopia Ray " prepares to strike in unison with its  equipped cards .     
 Yuma and Astral speak in unison, Yuma's hand glowing with power. They tell all the light and power to gather on their right fist and illuminate the path towards hope once more. Yelling  "Final Shining Draw! ", they draw " ZW - Tornado Bringer ". Yuma  equips  "Utopia Ray" with "Tornado Bringer", causing it to glow green with its new energy. Vetrix is taken aback, calling it "ZEXAL Weapon Twin Sword Style" (This scene is cut from the dub). The ATK of "Utopia Ray" increases by 1300, to 5000, shocking Vetrix. Yuma reveals that the equipped monster cannot be  targeted  by card effects that destroy cards, adding that the effect of " Zexal Weapon - Lightning Blade " will prevent  Spell  and  Trap Cards  on his  field  from being destroyed. Therefore, neither the Equip Cards nor "Utopia Ray" can be destroyed by card effects, making the destruction effect of "Heraldry Crest" useless. Yuma says that "Utopia Ray" in "Twin Sword Style" could be described as invincible. He orders "Utopia Ray" to attack with " Rising Sun Double Chaos Slash ".
 
         Vetrix's hand glows with the power of " Heraldry Burst ".     
 The two "ZW -" monsters transform into their monsters forums and stand next to "Utopia Ray". Vetrix activates his face-down " Heraldry Burst ",  returning  both "ZW -" cards to Yuma's  hand . Thus, the ATK of "Utopia Ray" falls to its  original value  of 2500. Vetrix's hand glows with energy as he reveals that at the  End Phase , "Heraldry Burst" will inflict 500  damage  to Yuma for each card returned to his hand. Vetrix says that with their  Battle Phase  over, all they can do his end their turn - and lose. Yuma insists he won't give up, but Astral asks what he plans to do. Yuma has no plan, but Astral says he's still right for not giving up. Vetrix asks Astral what he'll do, who again says he already has the winning formula.
 Together, Yuma and Astral declare they are activating " ZEXAL Catapult ". This lets them  Special Summon  a "ZW -" monster from their hand. They Special Summon "Lightning Blade" in  Attack Position , who is launched from the catapult back to the field. Vetrix asks if they've forgotten the effect of "Heraldry Crest", which immediately  negates  the effects of "Lightning Blade" and allows "Heraldry Crest" to use them itself. Unphased, they declare they are activating the effect of the " Amarylease " in their Graveyard, banishing it to allow them to  Tribute Summon  once this turn with one less  Tribute  than would usually be required. They Summon "Tornado Bringer" with no Tributes, whose effects are drained by "Heraldry Crest". Bronk thinks they've failed - Yuma already had no chance of winning. Flip says it's over and Tori mutters Yuma's name again. Vetrix says they are just struggling futilely now. Astral points out that the  Levels  of "Lightning Blade" and "Tornado Bringer" are both 5. Yuma adds that the conditions are met and Vetrix realizes they plan to overlay the "ZW -" monsters. 
 
         " ZW - Leo Arms " is created.     
 They overlay them to  Xyz Summon  " ZW - Leo Arms " in Attack Position. "Utopia Ray" attaches the armor of "Leo Arms" over its own armor, as Yuma reveals he can equip it to increase the ATK of "Utopia Ray" by 3000, adding that that effect cannot be negated. They chant "The raging impact from warrior's golden armor will shake the ground, the blitz of lightning, please inject the force of God-slayer to the warrior! Beast-Armor Fusion, Lion King Hope Ray!!! (This chant is cut from the dub)" Vetrix asks if they've forgotten their Battle Phase is already over. Yuma says that "Leo Arms" will let "Utopia Ray" attack in  Main Phase 2 . Vetrix insists that's impossible, with Yuma saying that this it the ultimate "ZW -" monster.
 
         The true form of " Number 69: Heraldry Crest ".     
 Vetrix chides them, saying that as the weapons were overlaid, they lost their original effects. Therefore, the effect of "Heraldry Crest" can affect "Utopia Ray" again. Vetrix detaches an Overlay Unit and "Heraldry Crest" changes form again as it prepares to destroy any card on the field. He adds that the form that "Heraldry Crest" has taken on due to its effect is its true form. Vetrix targets "Utopia Ray" with " Shatter Stream ". Yuma reveals the final effect of "Leo Arms" - once per turn, he can negate the effect of his opponent's monster and halve that monster's ATK. "Utopia Ray" cleaves the tail of "Heraldry Crest" off and its ATK falls to 1550. Vetrix again yells this is impossible and Yuma and Astral order "Utopia Ray" to attack with " Rising Sun Triple Chaos Slash ". "Heraldry Crest" is destroyed in a massive explosion (during the explosion the "X" from the  Yu-Gi-Oh! ZEXAL  logo can be briefly seen) as Vetrix is pitched to the ground screaming, his Life Points falling from 3800 to 0. Tears in her eyes, Tori leaps to her feet and yells that Yuma did it. Bronk and Cathy both cheer as well, while Flip and Caswell say that "Zexalura" did a great job.
 
         The Sphere Field absorbs Yuma's " Numbers ".     Mr. Heartland  mutters Yuma's name in astonishment. Realizing where he is, he announces the winner of the first  World Duel Carnival  as Yuma Tsukumo.  Dr. Faker  muses that  Byron  lost, but it didn't matter who won - he'll recover the " Numbers " here and now. Electricity pulses around the Sphere Field, hitting both players. "Numbers" fly from the chests of both Yuma and Vetrix and are absorbed into the Sphere Field's core. Vetrix's  crest  glows in his eye, but it vanishes as he screams in pain. Electricity spreads to the whole Duel Tower, which begins to crumble before an explosion wracks the base of it. The crowd streams from  Duel Tower Stadium  in a panic. Tori yells Yuma's name, while Shark exits the hospital as he sees the tower base explode, also saying Yuma's name.
         Yuma saves Vetrix with " ZW - Lightning Blade ".     
 Faker laughs, saying that Byron's power is no threat after the "Numbers" are gone. Vetrix is pitched to the edge of the Sphere Field before the core begins to blow him towards it. Faker yells "Disappear, Byron!" Yuma flies towards Vetrix and grabs his hand, materializing "Zexal Weapon - Lightning Blade" in his other hand. Driving the blade through the edge of the Sphere Field, he enables both of them to hang on. Vetrix remembers Kazuma saving him in a similar fashion years ago. Yuma asks what on earth is going on. Vetrix tells him that the Sphere Field is dedicated to collect the "Numbers". Now every "Number" that appeared in the World Duel Carnival was gathered in the finals. Faker would not pass up that opportunity. Yuma asks if it was a trap then and Vetrix confirms it, saying Faker let them Duel here and waiting until the power of the "Numbers" expanded. The grip of the sword  begins to break a bit. Vetrix urges Yuma to let go of him - the Sphere Field has classified him as an "unwanted object". If Yuma does not let go, both of them will fall. Yuma refuses and Vetrix is confused as to why he would save him. Yuma insists he's already explained it - anyone that Duels him is his friend. Yuma says he does not understand complicated things, but insists that Vetrix can gain friends and bonds through Dueling as well. Vetrix tells him he finally understands why Yuma wouldn't give up and calls Yuma's Dueling already beyond his own power of revenge. Still, Vetrix says he cannot live as Yuma and Kazuma do.
 
         Dr. Faker  confronts Yuma and Astral.     
 Vetrix continues that he can't let Faker have his way and that he will release the souls he has captured. Blue light streams from Vetrix, which exits the Sphere Field and hits  Heartland Tower .  Kite  and  Hart  awaken. Vetrix tells both Yuma and Astral "good-bye" before releasing his hand. As he falls towards the Sphere Field's core, Vetrix opens his other palm. Three orbs of light of three different colors sit in it - yellow, red and blue. Remembering his family, he vows never again to forget and asks for forgiveness. The three orbs fly off and Vetrix descends into the core. Yuma yells Vetrix's name and elsewhere,  Quinton ,  Trey , and  Quattro  awaken. The Sphere Field flies off the Duel Tower and hits the top of Heartland Tower. Shark begins running towards it. Inside the Sphere Field, Faker finally appears, laughing. He tells Yuma and Astral it is time for the final cleaning - the elimination of the  Astral World .
 
 Featured Duel: Yuma Tsukumo vs. Vetrix 
 Duel continues from  the previous episode . 
 Turn 7: Vetrix 
 Vetrix  draws. He then  activates  the  effect  " Number 69: Heraldry Crest " absorbed from " Chaos Number 39: Utopia Ray ",  detaching  an  Overlay Unit  ("Heraldry Crest": 1  → 0 ORU) to increase the  ATK  of "Heraldry Crest" by 500 and decrease the ATK of "Utopia Ray" by 1000 ("Heraldry Crest": 3100 → 3600 ATK, "Utopia Ray": 3700 → 2700 ATK). "Heraldry Crest"  attacks  "Utopia Ray", but  Yuma  activates his  face-down  " Half Unbreak " to prevent "Utopia Ray" from being destroyed and halve the  Battle Damage  he takes (Yuma: 500 → 50 LP). Vetrix activates the effect of the " Heraldic Beast Twin-Headed Eagle " in his  Graveyard ,  banishing  it in order to  attach  two monsters from his Graveyard to "Heraldry Crest" as Overlay Units (as "Heraldry Crest" is a " Heraldry "  Xyz Monster ) ("Heraldry Crest": 0 → 2 ORU). Vetrix  Sets  a card. On Vetrix's End Phase, the effect "Heraldry Crest" absorbed from "Utopia Ray" expires ("Heraldry Crest": 3600 → 3100 ATK, "Utopia Ray": 2700 → 3700 ATK).
 
                 ZW - Tornado Bringer   "Tornado Bringer " is equipped.     
 Turn 8: Yuma 
Yuma performs a Final  Shining Draw  and  draws  " ZW - Tornado Bringer ". He activates the first effect of "Tornado Bringer" to  equip  it to "Utopia Ray" and increase its ATK by 1300 ("Utopia Ray": 3700 → 5000 ATK). Due to the second effect of "Tornado Bringer", "Utopia Ray" can't be  targeted  by effects that  destroy  cards. "Utopia Ray" attacks "Heraldry Crest", but Vetrix activates his face-down " Heraldry Burst " to  return  all cards in Yuma's  Spell & Trap Card Zone  to his  hand  ("Utopia Ray": 5000 → 2500 ATK) and end the Battle Phase. When it's Yuma's End Phase, the final effect of "Heraldry Burst" will inflict 500 damage to Yuma per returned card. 
 
Yuma activates " ZEXAL Catapult " to Special Summon " ZW - Lightning Blade " ( 5/1200/2000) in  Attack Position .                  ZW - Lion Arms   " ZW - Leo Arms " is Summoned.      Yuma activates the effect of the " Amarylease " in his Graveyard, banishing it to allow him to  Tribute Summon  a monster with one less  Tribute  this turn. He  Normal Summons  "Tornado Bringer" with no Tributes ( 5/1300/1800) in Attack Position.
Yuma  overlays  "Lightning Blade" and "Tornado Bringer" in order to  Xyz Summon  " ZW - Leo Arms " ( 5/3000/1200) in Attack Position. Yuma activates the first effect of "Leo Arms", equipping it to "Utopia Ray" and increasing its ATK by 3000 ("Utopia Ray": 2500 → 5500 ATK) (this effect can't be negated as per the condition of the first effect of "Leo Arms).                  ZW - Lion Arms Effect   "Leo Arms" allows "Utopia Ray" to attack again, and the second tranformation of "Heraldry Crest".      Yuma then activates the second effect of "Leo Arms" to allow "Utopia Ray" to attack once during  Main Phase 2 . "Utopia Ray" attacks "Heraldry Crest", but Vetrix activates the effect of "Heraldry Crest" ("Heraldry Crest": 2 → 1 ORU) to destroy "Utopia Ray". Yuma activates the last effect of "Leo Arms" to negate the effects of "Heraldry Crest" and halve its ATK ("Heraldry Crest": 3100 → 1550 ATK). "Utopia Ray" destroys "Heraldry Crest" (Vetrix: 3800 → 0 LP).
