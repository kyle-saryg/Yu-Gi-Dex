 Biography 
 Duelist Kingdom 
 In the  Duelist Kingdom  tournament, they meet up  Bandit Keith , who agrees coach them through the tournament so all four of them will advance to Pegasus' castle. Keith wanted revenge at  Maximillion Pegasus  for humiliating him in the final match of the Inter-continental Championship. While helping them win Duels the first day of the tournament, Keith secretly intends to use them for their  Star Chips . When  Keith  finds out about  Yugi Muto ,  Joey Wheeler , and the rest of the gang, they believe they will get in their way, and seek to eliminate them. When Joey runs away from the group towards a waterfall, Zygor beats him unconscious and he wakes up in cave with a  Dueling Arena , complete with a  Graveyard Field . Bonz challenges Joey to a  Duel  that he tricks him into thinking he must accept. Bonz has the upper hand, as his  Zombie - Type  monsters gain a 30%  ATK  and  DEF  bonus because of the  Graveyard Field , and when they are  destroyed , they just regenerate, and become even stronger from " Call of the Haunted ". However, when  Yugi  and the gang arrive, Joey manages to figure out the Zombie's main weakness and that is their  DEF  is 0. Using " Shield & Sword " to switch their  ATK  and  DEF  values, Joey wins the  Duel .  Bandit Keith  then locks the gang in, and turns on his own companions. Since Sid and Zygor had five Star Chips each, Bandit Keith takes them from them (along with a Dueling Gauntlet) after beating up Bonz for losing. With those ten Star Chips, he becomes the first to qualify for the finals.
 
 Battle City 
 Sid, Bonz and Zygor are then seen right before the  Battle City  finals. The three reside in a nearby cemetery and trick people into giving up their  Locator Cards . However,  Yami Bakura  is not intimidated by their act and challenges them to a  Duel  in which the winner gets all the  Locator Cards , and thus goes directly to the  Battle City Finals . Bakura wins in just a few moves, and then banishes them to Hell (the  Shadow Realm  in the dub).
