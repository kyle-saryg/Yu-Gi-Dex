 A  Flip effect  (リバース効果  Ribāsu Kōka  "Reverse Effect"), formatted  Flip Effect  prior to the version 9.0  TCG   rulebook , is a kind of  Trigger Effect  possessed exclusively by  Flip monsters . This kind of effect activates when the Flip monster is  flipped   face-up  (by  battle , a  Flip Summon , or a  card effect ). In  card text , Flip effect is marked with the all-caps text "FLIP: ".
 If the monster is flipped up and  destroyed by battle , the card is  destroyed  first, then its effect is activated and  resolved  on the  field  in the  Damage Step  after  damage calculation ; since the card is already destroyed, effects like that of " Hane-Hane " cannot target themselves.
 Not all monsters with effects that activate upon flipping face-up are Flip monsters; some monsters have  Pseudo-Flip Effects , which function identically to Flip effects other than the monsters not being considered Flip monsters (so their effects can activate if flipped by cards like " Ceasefire "). In addition, not all Flip monsters' have effects that trigger upon being flipped face-up, such as " Worm Linx " and " Aroma Jar ".
 Previously, Flip Effects were considered a distinct kind of effect from Trigger Effects, and several card effects specifically affected Flip Effects; such cards now instead affect all effects of Flip monsters.
 In  Yu-Gi-Oh! The Duelists of the Roses , a  Flip Effect  is a one-time effect that is activated only when the card is manually flipped face-up or as a result of another event, such as battle.
