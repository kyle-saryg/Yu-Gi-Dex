 Bugs 
 Below is a list of the bugs in the game, these bugs may be fixed in the future. If a bug is fixed, please do not remove it, simply stated that the bugs is fixed. 
 
   This list is currently incomplete. 
 When a card is Special Summoned from your hand and there is more than one copies in the hand, the copies will be shown in the hand. This remain as long as the hand aren't randomly shuffled. This bug was fixed in version 0.514_v26 (ver. 1.06 for Android). 
 When " Soul Release " is played and more than 3 cards are  selected , the game will crash. This bug was fixed in version 0.514_v26 (ver. 1.06 for Android). 
 A previous Duel that either the player or the opponent won or lost can be repeated, this causes the player and the opponent to have the same cards from before. Furthermore, this can occur while facing a different opponent instead only the player will have the same cards from before. 
 If the player tries to connect the game server with a low  mobile network , the game will crash. This can be fixed by switching to a  wireless network . 
 If the player use a non-English setting and manage to crash the game, then the card shown in the selection menu will have English text on the name and text box instead. Spell and Trap Card will only retain the non-English text on the card type section. 
 If a  Chain  occurred while the opponent attempts to  Summon  " Darkness Neosphere ", the game will crash. This bug was fixed in version 1.925a_v57a (ver. 57a for Android/ver 1.925 for iOS). 
 Before the start of a Duel, a small gift icon will briefly appear, and then disappear. This occur in version 1.925a_v57a (ver. 57a for Android/ver 1.925 for iOS). This bug was fixed in version 2.28a_v97a (ver. 97a for Android/ver 2.000 for iOS). 
 If the player were to go near as 200 pages in the new cards box from the Deck Editor section, the game will crash. Furthermore, if the player were to tap as fast as possible, it will crash being below 200 pages. This occur in version 1.925a_v57a (ver. 57a for Android/ver 1.925 for iOS). 
 If the player tap on the Recipe icon in Deck Editor, the game will crashed. Can be fixed by deleting app and redownloading. This occur in version 1.925a_v57a (ver. 57a for Android/ver 1.925 for iOS). 
 Some  Pendulum Monsters  have their card text glitched up when placed onto the  Monster Zone  or  Pendulum Zone . Sometimes the card text for Pendulum Monsters will be blank and sometimes the Monster Effect will be shown instead. This occur in version 2.28a_v97a (ver. 97a for Android/ver 2.000 for iOS). This bug was fixed in version 4.02a_v119a (ver. 119a for Android/ver. 2.100 for iOS). 
 If a card with a long text is activated, the text in the prompt to confirm the activation is shown outside the prompt. This occur in version 2.28a_v97a (ver. 97a for Android/ver 2.000 for iOS). This bug was fixed in version 3.8a_v106a (ver. 106a for Android/ver. 2.010 for iOS). 
 If the player uses the effect of " Superheavy Samurai Warlord Susanowo " to target a  Field Spell  in the opponent's Graveyard, the game will crash as the card is being placed onto the opponent's  Field Zone  instead of the player's. This occur in version 2.28a_v97a (ver. 97a for Android/ver 2.000 for iOS). 
 If the player uses a monster with a  ATK  that is higher than the  Xyz Monster  as  Xyz Material , the monster with the highest ATK will sometime be on top of the Xyz Monster instead. This causes the game function for the Xyz Monster like activates its effect, attacks, look at its Material(s) and switches battle position to not work. So far, the effect that would work is the text "During each of your End Phases: Detach 1 Xyz Material from this card.". Furthermore, cards that increases ATK like  Field Spell Card  or  Continuous Spell Card  will sometime affect the monster that is used as Material. The only solution toward this problem is to detach the monster with the higher ATK before the bug occurred. This occur in version 2.28a_v97a (ver. 97a for Android/ver 2.000 for iOS). 
 If the player use a card that prevent themselves from drawing for the rest of the turn and has a another copies of the card in the Graveyard, then when the player was to draw a card, multiple copies of the card will be activated, instead of one copy. This occur in version 2.28a_v97a (ver. 97a for Android/ver 2.000 for iOS). 
 If the player is Dueling in a two out of three match, the second match would always featured an inaccurate Deck count. Furthermore, if the player in the previous match has a lower count than the opponent, then in the next match, the opponent would start with a inaccurate count. Though if both players have a one to two card difference in the previous match, then in the next match, both players will start with an inaccurate count. Also, if the player was to surrender the Duel, then the player who surrender will have the inaccurate Deck count. This bug is easily fixed whenever the Deck is shuffled. This occur in version 3.18a_v116a (ver. 116a for Android/ver. 2.020 for iOS). 
 If the player was to tap/use a Pendulum Monster(s) with no  Pendulum Effect , the game will crash. So far, the cards are " Flash Knight ", " Mandragon ", " Performapal Trump Girl ", " Steel Cavalry of Dinon " and the " Majespecter " Pendulum Monsters. Furthermore, if the player was to Duel a Duelist with a certain Decklists that used a Pendulum Monster(s) with no Pendulum Effect in Campaign Mode, the Duel would be render unplayable as the game will crashed. These Duelists are  Dennis McField  (Majespecter) and  Yuya Sasaki  (Performapal/Odd-Eyes: "Performapal Trump Girl"). Also, if the player were to taps on these cards in Deck Editor, the game will crashed. This occurs in version 4.02a_v119a (ver. 119a for Android/ver. 2.100 for iOS). 
 If a Xyz Monster was Xyz Summoned using only Pendulum Monsters as an Xyz Material, then the game will crash as soon as the Xyz Summoned monster is placed onto the field. This occur in version 4.02a_v119a (ver. 119a for Android/ver. 2.100 for iOS). 
 If a non-Pendulum Monster was  Tribute Summoned / Set  using only the face-up Pendulum Monster on the  Monster Zone  as  Tribute , then the game will crash as soon as the Tribute Summoned/Set non-Pendulum Monster is placed onto the field. This occur in version 4.02a_v119a (ver. 119a for Android/ver. 2.100 for iOS). 
 Currently, the player is unable to manually look at either player's Graveyard, nor able to manually activate card effects from their own Graveyard, such as "White Stone of the Ancients." However, the player can still manually look at their own Extra Deck.
