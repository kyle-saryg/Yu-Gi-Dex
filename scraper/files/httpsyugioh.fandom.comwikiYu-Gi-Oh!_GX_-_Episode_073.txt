 Summary 
 Sartorius  sits at his headquarters, making further predictions with his  tarot cards . He determines that though both  Jaden Yuki  and  Aster Phoenix  are influencing his destiny, there is a third person. He journeys to  Duel Academy  once more to determine who that person might be. He realizes that the person he seeks is  Tyranno Hassleberry , who himself realizes that Sartorius is the one that  Chazz Princeton  has been raving about in regards to the  Society of Light .
 Sartorius challenges Hassleberry to a Duel, while promising to set Chazz back to normal should Hassleberry win. However, Sartorius has never used a  Duel Disk  before, so Hassleberry must explain to him how it works. The Duel goes quite evenly, with both players being reduced to only a few hundred  Life Points  in a few turns. Sartorius wins by using " Reversal of Fate " to change the  effects  of his " Arcana Force "  monsters . Despite his loss, Hassleberry is not converted to the Society of Light, much to Sartorius' shock. Hassleberry explains that in the past, he had excavated some Dinosaur fossils. His leg had been injured, and so the bone had been replaced by the fossilized Dinosaur bone he had uncovered. He claims that this "Dinosaur DNA" is what grants him immunity to the powers of Sartorius. A few days later, its revealed that Sartorius has officially enrolled at Duel Academy as a student.
 
 Featured Duel: Tyranno Hassleberry vs. Sartorius 
 Turn 1: Hassleberry 
Hassleberry draws " Giant Rex " and subsequently Normal Summons it (2000/1200) in  Attack Position .
 Turn 2: Sartorious 
Sartorius draws "Reversal of Fate". He then Normal Summons " Arcana Force I - The Magician " (1100/1100) in Attack Position. Since "The Magician" was summoned, it begins to rotate. It lands upright, so whenever a Spell Card is activated, the original ATK of "The Magician" will be doubled. [Notes 1] 
 Sartorius then  activates  " Future Vision " which allows him to  pick up  cards from Hassleberry's  Deck  until he picks up a  monster . Should that monster be of the same  Type  as a  face-up  monster on Hassleberry's side of the  field , Sartorius must  return  all the picked up cards to Hassleberry's Deck and Hassleberry will gain 1000  Life Points . Sartorius picks up " New Ultra Evolution " and " Ultimate Tyranno " and the latter monster is the same Type as "Giant Rex" (Hassleberry 4000 → 5000). The upright effect of "The Magician" activates ("The Magician": 1100 → 2200/1100). "The Magician" attacks and  destroys  "Giant Rex" (Hassleberry 5000 → 4800). Sartorius then  Sets  two cards. On Sartorius's End Phase, the effect of "The Magician" expires ("The Magician": 2200 → 1100/1100).
 Turn 3: Hassleberry 
Hassleberry draws. He then Normal Summons " Archeonys " (300/1300) in Attack Position. Hassleberry then Activates "New Ultra Evolution" to  Tribute  "Archeonys" and  Special Summon  " Dark Tyranno " (2600/1800) in Attack Position. The upright effect of "The Magician" activates ("The Magician": 1100 → 2200/1100). "Dark Tyranno" attacks and destroys "The Magician" (Sartorius 4000 → 3600).
 Turn 4: Sartorious 
Sartorius draws. He then activates " Pentacle of Ace ", which rotates upon activation. It lands upright, so Sartorius  draws  a card and gains 500  Life Points  (Sartorius 3600 → 4100). Sartorius then Normal Summons " Arcana Force VII - The Chariot " (1700/1700) in Attack Position. Since "The Chariot" was summoned, it begins to rotate. It lands upside down, so it will be Special Summoned to Hassleberry's side of the Field when it is destroyed in battle. [Notes 2] 
 "The Chariot" attacks "Dark Tyranno". "Dark Tyranno" destroys "The Chariot" (Sartorius 4100 → 3200). Since "The Chariot" was destroyed in battle, it is revived (1700/1700) in Attack Position and under Hassleberry's control. "The Chariot" rotates upon being summoned. It lands upside down once more. Sartorius then activates " Suit of Sword X ", which rotates upon activation. It stops upright, so all monsters on Hassleberry's side of the Field are destroyed. Sartorius then activates his face-down " Ace of Wand ", which rotates upon activation. It lands upside down, so Hassleberry takes damage equal to the combined ATK of his destroyed monsters (Hasslebery 4800 → 500).
 Turn 5: Hassleberry 
Hassleberry draws "Ultimate Tyranno". He then Normal Summons " Dyna Base " (0/2100) in Attack Position. Hassleberry then Tributes "Dyna Base" and the "Ultimate Tyranno" from his hand in order to Special Summon " Dyna Tank " (?/2100) in Attack Position. Due to the effect of "Dyna Tank", its ATK is equal to the ATK of the Dinosaur-type monster used for its summon ("Dyna Tank": ? → 3000/2100). "Dyna Tank" attacks  directly  (Sartorius 3200 → 200).
 Turn 6: Sartorious 
Sartorius draws. He then activates " Necro Sacrifice " to target the "Arcana Force VIII - The Strength" in his hand and allow himself to Normal Summon "The Strength" without Tributing by Special Summoning "The Chariot" (1700/1700) from his Graveyard to Hassleberry's side of the Field. Hassleberry chooses to Summon "The Chariot" in Attack Position. "The Chariot" rotates upon being summoned. It lands upside down.
 Sartorius then Normal Summons " Arcana Force VIII - The Strength " (1800/1800) in Attack Position without any Tributes. Since "The Strength" was summoned, it begins to rotate. It lands upright, so Sartorius can switch control of one monster of the field. He targets "Dyna Tank" for the upright effect of "The Strength", but the effect of "Dyna Tank" activates in response, switching the  target  for the effect of "The Strength" to "The Strength" itself and giving control of "The Strength" to Hassleberry.
 Sartorius then activates his face-down " Reversal of Fate " to switch the direction of all "Arcana Force" monsters on the field; "The Chariot" is now upright and "The Strength" is now upside down. Due to the Tails effect of "The Strength", Sartorius gains control of all monsters Hassleberry controls besides "The Strength". "Dyna Tank" attacks and destroys "The Strength" (Hassleberry 500 → 0).
 
 Differences in adaptations 
 In the Japanese version,  Sartorius  enters  Duel Academy  as a third-year student. This is changed to first-year in the English version.
 
 In the Japanese version, Aster learns that Chazz's weird behavior happened after he dueled Sartorius. No mention is made of that instance in the dub. 
 In the dub, Sartorius tells Hassleberry he uses more primeval methods to win duels. No mention is made of that instance in the original. 
 Errors 
 When Sartorius plays " Ace of Wand " in the dub, he incorrectly states that he - himself - will either gain or take damage, when it's Hassleberry who takes the effect.
