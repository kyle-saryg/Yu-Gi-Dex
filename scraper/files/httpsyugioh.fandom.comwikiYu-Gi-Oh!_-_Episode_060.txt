 Major events 
 Kaiba  faces off against  a Battle City Duelist  who was harassing another. He uses " Obelisk the Tormentor ". 
 Marik  now knows where "Obelisk The Tormentor" is after Kaiba used it. He remembers how he stole the other two Egyptian God cards from a cave in Egypt and threatened  Ishizu  for the final one, also revealing in the flashback that he is her brother. 
 Yami Yugi  is told to enter a circus tent by a harlequin whose "master" is wating inside.
 Yugi enters a real life  Mystic Box  and disappears into an underground chamber, which blocks the transmission to the  KaibaCorp  building. 
 He meets  Arkana , who also has a " Dark Magician " in his deck, but this one looks different to Yugi's. He challenges Yugi to a Duel. 
 Both Duelists have their ankles locked so they cannot escape. As they lose life points, a buzzsaw will approach them and slice off their legs if they lose (in the dub, the loser will be sent to the  Shadow Realm  via a Dark Energy Disc). A box holding a key will open for the winner. 
 Featured Duel: Yami Yugi vs. Arkana, Part 1 
 Turn 1: Yami Yugi 
 Yami Yugi  draws. He then  Sets  a card and  Normal Summons  " Alpha The Magnet Warrior " (1400/1700) in  Defense Position .
 Turn 2: Arkana 
Arkana's opening hand contains " The Mystical Guillotine ", " Mystic Tomato ", " Beckon to the Dark ", " Doll of Demise ", and " Dark Magician ". Since  Arkana  cheated in shuffling his  Deck , he has his own "Dark Magician" in his  hand . Arkana draws " Legion the Fiend Jester " and subsequently Normal Summons it (1300/1500) in  Defense Position . Arkana intends to Tribute his "Legion" and another monster on his next turn in order to  Tribute Summon  "Dark Magician".
 Turn 3: Yami Yugi 
Yami Yugi draws. His hand contains "Card Destruction", " Celtic Guardian ", " Kuriboh ", " Beaver Warrior ", and " Full Moon ". Since Yami Yugi doesn't trust in Arkana's  shuffling , he  activates  " Card Destruction " to force both players to discard their entire hand and draw cards equal to the number of cards they just discarded. Arkana  draws  five cards while Yami Yugi draws four. 
 Yami Yugi then activates his face-down " Brain Control " to take  control  of "Legion the Fiend Jester" until the End Phase. He then  Tributes  "Legion the Fiend Jester" and "Alpha the Magnet Warrior" in order to Tribute Summon " Dark Magician " (2500/2100) in  Attack Position . "Dark Magician"  attacks   directly  (Arkana 4000 → 1500).
 Duel continues in  the next episode . 
 
 Differences in adaptations 
       The Japanese saw (left) and the English dark energy disc (right).     
 In the Japanese version, the loser will have their legs cut off by a buzzsaw. In the English dub, the saws are replaced by the Dark Energy Discs that would send the loser's mind to the Shadow Realm.
 The saws glow in the English dub to make them look like Dark Energy Discs. 
 A scene of Zeus sealing the box and Pandora opening it, and tiny little hope left in the bottom of the box, is cut from the English version. 
 Numerous changes were made to shots of the  hands  of both  Duelists , including the addition of  Egyptian Gods  it would be impossible for them to have. Pictures and details can be found  here . 
 The harlequin that points out where Yugi has to go is silent in the original. In the dub, he speaks to Yugi while pointing but doesn't move his mouth. 
 Errors 
 Main article:  Card replacements in the dub § Arkana 
 In the dub, many cards in each Duelists' hands are changed to cards that are impossible for them to have.
 After Summoning "Legion the Fiend Jester", when Arkana looks back into his hand  The Winged Dragon of Ra  can be seen behind "Dark Magician".  Besides Arkana not having this card, it couldn't be in his hand if he did, as his opening hand was shown, and the first card he drew had to be the Fiend Jester. 
 Then, after Yugi activates " Card Destruction ", " Obelisk the Tormentor " can be seen in Arkana's hand, despite not being in his hand moments earlier (and, of course, Kaiba possessing Obelisk) 
 When Yugi plays " Card Destruction ", it is seen on his  Duel Disk  in Defense Position instead of " Alpha The Magnet Warrior ". 
 Ironically, despite the fact that Mystic Tomato's card art was changed to the US version, the hologram was not changed to reflect this. 
 Quotes 
 Mokuba:   (to Koji Nagumo)  If you want to stay in this tournament, you’re gonna have to do what I say! 
 Koji Nagumo:  Or what?  (growls) 
 Seto Kaiba:   (from behind him)  Or you’ll have to deal with  me . 
 Koji Nagumo:   (turns around to see Seto Kaiba)  What’d you say?  (Kaiba takes one step over to him and stops, giving him a cool stare) 
 Mokuba:   (grins upon seeing Seto)  Hey, bro! 
 Koji Nagumo:   (suddenly realizes who it is)  Se — Seto Kaiba? 
 Seto Kaiba:  When you speak to my brother that way, you dishonor me  and  the Battle City tournament. And besides, I have very little patience for  bullies .
 Seto Kaiba:  No one messes with my little brother, especially with an Egyptian God Card in my deck.
