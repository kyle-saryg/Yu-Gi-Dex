 Featured Duel: Soulburner vs. Windy 
 Duel continues from the previous episode . 
 Turn 4: Soulburner 
As his  LP  are lower than this opponent's,  Soulburner   activates  " Salamangreat Performance ", letting him  target  a  Level  4 or lower " Salamangreat "  monster  in his  GY  and  add a card  with the same name from his  Deck  to his  hand . He adds a copy of " Salamangreat Fowl ". As he  controls  no monsters, Soulburner then activates the effect of the " Salamangreat Mole " in his GY,  banishing  it to  return  5 "Salamangreat" cards from his GY to his Deck, then  draw  two cards. He returns "Fowl", "Performance", " Salamangreat Beat Bison " and " Salamangreat Roar " to his Deck and " Salamangreat Heatleo " to his  Extra Deck  and draws 2 cards. As he controls no monsters, Soulburner activates " Rising Fire ", letting him  Special Summon  a  FIRE  monster from his GY and  equip  it with "Rising Fire", increasing its  ATK  by 500. He Special Summons "Heatleo" ("Heatleo": 2300 → 2800 ATK). As  Windy  controls only 1 " Stormrider " Link Monster, the effect of " Stormrider Blast "  negates  the effects of all  Link Monsters  his opponent controls with an equal or lower Link Rating than the "Stormrider" he controls. In this case, the LINK-3 " Stormridership Bahamut Bomber " so the effects of "Heatleo" are negated. Soulburner equips "Bahamut Bomber" with " Salamangreat Sparks ". Now, if it  battles  an opponent's monster, its ATK will become equal to the current ATK of the monster it's battling during  damage calculation . Soulburner then equips "Heatleo" with " Salamangreat Claw ", which will prevent the equipped monster from being  destroyed by battle  or card effects and allow it to inflict  piercing  battle damage. As he controls no cards in his  Spell & Trap Card Zone , Windy activates the effect of "Bahamut Bomber", destroying a card in Soulburner's Spell & Trap Zone and inflicting 500 damage. He destroys "Claw" (Soulburner: 600 → 100 LP). 
 Soulburner  Normal Summons  " Salamangreat Falco " (1200/1600). As a "Salamangreat" monster besides "Fowl" was Normal or Special Summoned, Soulburner Special Summons "Fowl" (1800/200) from his hand in Attack Position via its own effect. Soulburner uses "Falco" to  Link Summon  " Salamangreat Balelynx " to the Extra Monster Zone. "Stormrider Blast" negates its effects. As "Falco" was sent to the GY, its effect activates, letting Soulburner  Set  a "Salamangreat"  Spell / Trap Card  from his GY. He Sets "Claw". Soulburner uses "Balelynx" and "Fowl" to Link Summon " Salamangreat Sunlight Wolf ". Its effects are negated by "Blast". Soulburner activates the effect of " Salamangreat Sanctuary " to use "Heatleo" to  Reincarnation Link Summon  another copy of "Heatleo". Soulburner equips his Set "Claw" to "Heatleo". When "Claw" is equipped to a Reincarnation Link Summoned monster, it can attack a number of times equal to its Link Rating. 
 "Healeo" attacks "Bahamut Bomber", with the effect of the equipped "Sparks" making the ATK of "Bahamut Bomber" equal to that of the monster it is battling ("Bahamut Bomber": 3500 → 2300 ATK). The effect of "Claw" prevents the destruction of "Heatleo" by battle, so only "Bahamut Bomber" is destroyed. As "Sparks" was sent to the Graveyard, its effect activates, letting Soulburner Special Summon two " Salamangreat Tokens " to either side of the field. He Special Summons them to Windy's field in Defense Position (0/0). "Heatleo" attacks and destroys a "Salamangreat Token", with "Claw" inflicting  piercing  Battle Damage (Windy: 4000 → 1700 LP). "Heatleo" attacks a "Salamangreat Token", but Windy activates the effect of the " Stormrider Gulldiver " in his hand, sending it to the GY to halve the Battle Damage and end the  Battle Phase . The "Token" is destroyed (Windy: 1700 → 550 LP). As the effect of "Gulldiver" was used this turn, Windy activates its other effect,  banishing  it from his GY to Special Summon a "Stormrider" Link Monster from his GY with a Link Rating less than or equal to the number of monsters destroyed by battle this turn (in this case, 3), but its ATK is halved and its effects are negated. He Special Summons "Bahamut Bomber" ("Bahamut Bomber": 2800 → 1400 ATK). The effect of "Blast" increases the ATK of all "Stormrider" Link Monsters by 400, plus another 300 for each "Stormrider"  Field Spell Card  in the GY ("Bahamut Bomber": 1400 → 2100 ATK). Soulburner activates " Salamangreat Sublimation ",  Tributing  a "Salamangreat" monster to gain LP equal to its ATK and draw a card. He Tributes "Sunlight Wolf" (Soulburner: 100 → 1900 LP). Soulburner Sets the card he just drew. 
 Turn 5: Windy 
During the  Standby Phase , " Stormridership Stratastorm " returns to Windy's field ("Stratastorm": 1500 → 2200 ATK). As he has 1000 or fewer LP, Windy activates his  Skill , Storm Access, letting him add a  random  Link Monster in the  Data Storm  to his Extra Deck. He adds " Stormriderflagship Bahamut Bomber Custom ". Windy uses "Stratastorm" and "Bahamut Bomber" to Link Summon "Stormriderflagship Bahamut Bomber Custom" (3000 → 3700/LINK-4/←↙↘→). As he controls no cards in his Spell & Trap Card Zone, Windy activates the effect of "Bomber Custom", letting him treat one of Soulburner's monsters as a  Continuous Spell Card . "Heatleo" is moved to the Spell & Trap Card Zone. As he controls no cards in his Spell & Trap Card Zone, Windy activates the other effect of "Bomber Custom", destroying as many cards in his opponent's Spell & Trap Card Zone as possible and inflicting 500 damage per card. This effect cannot be  responded  to. "Heatleo" and Soulburner's Set card are destroyed (Soulburner: 1900 → 900 LP). "Bomber Custom" attacks  directly , but Soulburner activates the effect of the " Salamangreat Ascetic " in his GY, banishing it to target a "Salamangreat" Link Monster and a non-Link "Salamangreat" monster in his Graveyard, returning the Link Monster to his Extra Deck and Special Summoning the other monster in Defense Position with its effects negated. He returns "Sunlight Wolf" to the Extra Deck and Special Summons "Falco" (1200/1600). A  replay  occurs and "Custom" attacks "Falco", but Soulburner activates the effect of the "Balelynx" in his GY, banishing it to prevent the destruction of his "Salamangreat" monster by battle.  
 Turn 6: Soulburner 
Soulburner draws and Normal Summons " Salamangreat Gazelle " (1500/1000). As it was Normal Summoned, its effect activates, letting Soulburner send a "Salamangreat" monster besides "Gazelle" from his Deck to his GY. He sends " Salamangreat Spinny ". As he controls a "Salamangreat" monster besides "Spinny" and "Spinny" is in his GY, Soulburner activates the effect of "Spinny", Special Summoning it (1000/1500) in Defense Position. Soulburner  overlays  his two Level 3 monsters to  Xyz Summon  " Salamangreat Miragestallio " (2000/900) in Attack Position. Soulburner activates the effect of "Miragestallio",  detaching  an Overlay Unit to Special Summon a "Salamangreat" monster from his Deck in Defense Position, but this will prevent him from activating monster effects of non-FIRE monsters for the rest of the turn. He Special Summons "Beat Bison" (2800/1000). He activates the effect of "Beat Bison", letting him target FIRE Link Monsters in his GY up to the number of face-up cards his opponent controls and return them to the Extra Deck, then he can negate the effects of cards his opponent controls up to the number of cards returned. He returns two copies of "Heatleo" to to negate the effects of "Bomber Custom" and "Blast" ("Bomber Custom": 3700 → 3000 ATK). Soulburner uses "Miragestallio", "Falco" and "Beat Bison" to Link Summon "Heatleo". As "Miragestalio" was used as Link Material for a "Salamangreat" monster, its effect activates, letting Soulburner return a monster on the field to the hand. He targets "Bomber Custom", but Windy activates the effect of the " Stormrider Tubieloof " in his hand, sending it to the GY to negate a monster effect. Soulburner activates the effect of "Sanctuary", using "Heatleo" to Reincarnation Link Summon another copy of "Heatleo". As it was Reincarnation Link Summoned, its effect activates, letting Soulburner target a monster his opponent controls and change its ATK to that of a monster in his GY. He targets "Bomber Custom" and "Spinny" ("Bomber Custom": 3000 → 1000 ATK). "Heatleo" attacks and destroys "Bomber Custom" (Windy: 550 → 0 LP).
