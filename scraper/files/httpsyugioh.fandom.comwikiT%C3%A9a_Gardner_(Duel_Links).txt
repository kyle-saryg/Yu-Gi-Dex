 Description 
 Téa is  Yugi 's childhood friend who dreams of becoming a professional dancer. Though she won't call herself a Duelist, her bravery won't allow her to back down from any  Duel .
 
 Biography 
 After the player advances to Stage 5, they will encounter Téa for the first time. She initially expresses dismay that her friends registered her as a Duelist, even though she only came to Duel World to cheer on her friends. She complains that it's not fair, especially since she doesn't even know what cards are in her Deck. However, she audibly decides to make the best of her situation and take the chance to improve her Dueling skills.
 When the player challenges Téa to a Duel for the first time, she finds out from the player that they can't advance unless they defeat her. She briefly considers letting the player win, but decides that because it wouldn't be fun, the player wouldn't want that either. She then admits that although she may not be the toughest Duelist in Duel World, she has the heart of a champion, and prompts the player to Duel her.
 Upon Téa's first defeat, she briefly expresses frustration, before deciding that she should practice more so that she'll never feel like this again. She then prompts the player to "keep up the good work," and says she'll be cheering them on.
 After the player redeems their final unclaimed reward for Téa Gardner's Character Unlock Missions, they will encounter Téa again, who resolves that she's going to start Dueling every day. She reveals that this is because she has a dream of becoming the Duel World Queen, and that she'll accomplish it with the " Dark Magician Girl " card she possesses.
