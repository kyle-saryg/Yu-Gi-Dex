 Etymology 
         Linework by  Kazuki Takahashi .     
         "Lua and Luca's" names in the Japanese anime     
 Linework by  Kazuki Takahashi  used the spellings  Rua  and  Ruka  for the Japanese names of  Leo  and Luna. Throughout the Japanese anime, the spellings have alternated between  Lua  and  Luca  and  Rua  and  Ruka . The official subtitles for  Yu-Gi-Oh! 5D's  confirmed the English translation to be  Luca , however Takahashi's reference confirms it to instead be  Ruka . [10]  The differing names is due to Japanese speakers pronouncing "L" and "R" as the same sound.
 The  4Kids Entertainment  website listed Luca's English name as  Luna  in the characters page, while Lua had his changed to  Luka . Luka later had his name changed to  Leo , while Luna's stayed as Luna.
 
 Abilities 
 Luna has the unique ability to sense and communicate with  Duel Monster Spirits . [11]  Her most notable  spirit partners  are  Kuribon ,  Regulus  and  Ancient Fairy Dragon .
 In addition to her connection with Duel spirits, she has also been able to travel to the  Duel Monsters Spirit World  at the risk of having her body comatose in the real world (with the exception of when Regulus cast a spell to transfer her to the Spirit World. [12] ). [11] 
 She also has an ability to sense someone at times when they're in danger, such as when her brother was against  Devack  and in pain, or when  Yusei  was being shocked by officers near her house. In addition to this, she can feel or sense a person's Deck, such as before Yusei woke up, and  Akiza 's first Duel in the  Fortune Cup  where she could feel Akiza's Deck suffering. [13] [14] [15] [16] 
 
 Health 
 Luna is a very frail girl, getting very easily tired and does not get out much because of it. [7]  When she was younger, she fell into a coma for several days. However, she starts to get out more as the series progressed, and becomes less frail and tired after the  Dark Signers  arc, even going to  Duel Academy  with  Leo [17] , but is still badly hurt when taking on any real damage. [18]  She also suffered a heart attack after receiving several electric shocks and watching Leo die. [19] 
 
 Biography 
 History 
         3 year old Luna in the  Spirit World .     
 Luna lives together with her twin brother  Leo  in the  Tops  residential area. They spend most of their time alone together as their parents are usually at work. They were initially educated via the internet, so they spend most of their time inside.
 Luna has been Dueling since the age of three. Once, she lapsed into a coma after a Duel, and did not awaken for a month. During that month, her mind lived in the  Duel Monsters Spirit World  under the protection of  Ancient Fairy Dragon , one of the  Signer Dragons . Before waking up, she promised she would always be there to defend the Duel Spirits from evil that threatened the land. However, the pressure from undertaking such a task alone was too much and Luna had to forsake her promise, allowing the Duel Monsters Spirit World to fall later into the influence of  Zeman the Ape King , who without much difficulty with the help of his army, turned most of the spirits into stone, and eventually imprisoned them. He was even able to capture and rock-seal Ancient Fairy Dragon's spirit into the mountains. Luna later returns and saves the spirits with some help from Leo.  
 
 Fortune Cup 
 Luna was selected to participate in the  Fortune Cup . She was told she was randomly selected, but was invited so  Iliaster  could confirm that she is a  Signer . However, not up to participating,  Leo  planned to disguise himself as her and Duel in her place.
 Due to their  Marks , Luna was able to sense  Yusei  when he was attacked by  Sector Security . She and Leo rescued him after his Duel with  Trudge  and the resultant  Duel Runner  crash near their home. Yusei wanted to leave, feeling that he was putting them in danger, but Leo talked him into a Duel. After Yusei won, Luna and Leo manage to get him to stay for the night. They awake the next morning to find that Yusei had left after modifying their  Duel Disks  to fit their small arms.
 The next day, Leo entered the Fortune Cup disguised as Luna, but using  Zigzix 's  Signer -detecting technology,  Lazar  was not only able to determine that  Greiger  Dueled Leo instead of Luna, but also that Luna is a Signer.
 Luna faced off against  Professor Frank  due to  Rex Goodwin 's consolation game, but in the middle of the Duel, both she and Leo are hypnotized. Luna's conscious self awakens in the  Duel Monster Spirit World , where she sees the degradation of the dimension and decides to uphold her promise from then on. Before she concludes the match, Luna is called a Signer by Frank, although unaware at that moment of its meaning or its relationship with her Claw Mark of the Dragon. 
 Only Yusei becomes aware of her being one, though he does not tell the others. Eventually, though, they learn this after his Duel against  Akiza Izinski . She witnesses the appearance of the  Crimson Dragon  during Yusei and  Jack Atlas ' title Duel. Because of the Duel, Luna, along with the three other Signers, are transported to an alternate dimension. There they are shown two visions; one of the  Stairway to the Dragon Star , where the People of the Stars were worshiping the ancient Signers, and the other showing  Satellite  being destroyed, and in its place the appearance of a spider geoglyph. 
 After that, Luna and Akiza are the only ones to witness Jack's defeat. As they all return to the stadium, she reunites with Yusei in order to leave through an underground tunnel. Luna talks to Yusei about the vision, who responds that he doesn't know what it means, but that in any case he must prevent it from happening. She also asks him what is a Signer, to which  Yanagi  intervenes in order to answer to her. Luna learns its meaning and its relationship with her along birthmark, along with the fact that that Yusei, Jack, and Akiza are Signers too.
 
 Dark Signers 
 After the  Dark Signers  started taking action, Luna has been having vivid dreams of the  Signer Dragons  and the  Crimson Dragon  battling an unknown evil.  Ancient Fairy Dragon  gets pulled into an abyss, showing that the Dragon's card is currently with the  Dark Signers .
 As  Yusei  is about to come face to face with  Kalin Kessler , his  Mark of the Dragon  reacts along with Luna's,  Jack 's, and  Akiza 's. She notices this and Leo does too as he is nearby. Luna is able to sense that Yusei is the reason of why her Mark of the Dragon glows. After Yusei takes a hit by " Earthbound Immortal Ccpac Apu ", Luna's Mark of the Dragon gets etched into her arm. 
 Leo explains to  Tanner  and  Yanagi  that Luna is frail and therefore she can't go out much. Luna accompanies Leo, Tanner, and Yanagi to the  Arcadia Movement , where they meet  Sayer . He induces them to sleep with gas, wanting to make Luna a member of the organization due to her powers. Luna wakes up next to Akiza, where they both watch the Duel between Sayer and Leo. Akiza tells Luna that Sayer wants to test her brother to find out if he possesses any similar powers. Leo passes out upon losing as Luna calls out to him. 
 After the Duel, Akiza informs her that Leo isn't in danger. Luna clarifies Leo doesn't possess any powers, but he was still kept in a place with Luna. Akiza tells her that in any case the Arcadia Movement will be her new home, as she doesn't want Luna to walk through the same path she did; the path of being feared and abandoned by others because of her powers. Luna asks Ancient Fairy Dragon for help, but her spirit says that she cannot rescue her and that she is witnessing the posing threat of the Dark Signers. In order to set her free, Luna must join forces with her servant,  Regulus , who will eventually appear to her. Once Ancient Fairy Dragon is set free, she promises to protect Luna from the enemy.
 After Tanner frees her and Leo, while fleeing the building, she senses Akiza in a Duel as her Mark of the Dragon begins to glow. As she decides to find her, the four of them run into  Misty  and Akiza's Duel. As Luna notices the lizard  Dark mark , she recalls the vision of the battle between the  Crimson Dragon  and the "Earthbound Immortals" again. Right as Misty is about to Summon her "Earthbound Immortal", Luna's dragon birthmark protects her, Leo, Tanner, and Yanagi from being sacrificed for its Summon. Tanner gets her and Leo out in time as the building collapses.
 After Akiza lands in the hospital in a comatose state, Luna is there along with her brother and Jack. As with the rest of the people there, she witnesses the Duel between Yusei and Akiza. After it concludes, Akiza decides to help them in their fight against the Dark Signers. After it, Luna along with Leo and the other Signers are invited by  Rex Goodwin  into his house, as he wants to reveal to them some secret concerning the Crimson Dragon.
 She learns from him that those who are Signers exist within some sort of "fate", derived from the Crimson Dragon's power, one which cannot be escaped from. That strange fate was the one responsible for that all of the four Signers to have actually met in someway. Thus, the "Fate of the Signers" unites each and every one of Yusei, Jack, Akiza and her own destiny together in order to guide them all. 
 Nonetheless, according to Goodwin the four of them are not only  Duelists  chosen by the Crimson Dragon itself, but they are also the reincarnations of the ancient Signers themselves. Also already predicted thousands of years ago the four of them would encounter one another. She also learns about the Dark Signers' abilities involving their powers and use of the "Earthbound Immortals". According to Goodwin, their powers that manifest in a Duel come from the underworld. Also as they appeared on the city, many casualties occurred just like in  Satellite  due to their Immortals. Luna along with the others realize the shocking truth behind the transformation of an individual into a Dark Signer: It can't be reverted due to the fact those individuals are dead and that they are resurrected because of a powerful phenomenon occurring on the other side of the Underworld.
 After this she cheers Leo up, who feels he can't be a hero or protect her because of having lost to Sayer, by saying he doesn't have to be a hero, and to just protect her like he always has. 
 Like Jack and Akiza, she's present along with her brother during and after Yusei's match against  Roman Goodwin . After it concludes, the rest of the Dark Signers show themselves, as their ancient battle is about to commence. Later on as each one of the Signers is set on defeating their respective opponent, they split up to each of the four control units of the Original  Ener-D  Reactor. As Luna and Leo are taken by Trudge to where  Devack  is waiting, she instead travels into the Duel Monsters Spirit World in order to free Ancient Fairy Dragon. Due to this, Leo bravely challenges Devack to a Duel in her place, as he is determined to fulfill his promise of protecting her.
 In the Spirit World, Luna searches for Regulus. She gets chased down by an army of monkey spirits commanded by  Zeman the Ape King , who is Devack's  Dark Synchro Monster . The monkey army captures " Kuribon ", " Sunny Pixie ", and " Sunlight Unicorn ". She evades them with the help of a spirit named  Torunka . Luna eventually finds Regulus at Pojar Forest and tells to the Lion the promise long ago made to Ancient Fairy Dragon. However, because of the  Cursed Needle  in its ankle, he understands her in the opposite way. After a chase, Luna is finally able to dispose of the Needle and convince the White Lion of her righteous intentions by showing her Mark of the Dragon. After that Regulus, Luna, and Torunka set off to  Zeman's castle . They are able to get inside by tricking Zeman into thinking that Luna is a servant of Zeman and has caught Regulus. She also tells Zeman to curse both Regulus and Ancient Fairy Dragon in order to minus Ancient Fairy Dragon completely. Zeman falls for this and is about to release her.
 However, Zeman finds out they were trying to trick him and orders his army to attack them. He is eventually killed by Regulus, and at the same moment, Leo defeats him in the real world. Devack then Summons his " Earthbound Immortal Cusiullu " and attacks Leo, who withstands the assault. Torunka sends Luna back to the real world, where she takes over the Duel for her injured brother. Devack then attempts to use " Ancient Fairy Dragon " against Luna, but she forces him to sacrifice it in order to save his "Earthbound Immortal" from being  destroyed , which allows her to Summon her dragon to her side of the  field . Once this is done, Regulus appears and breaks the dragons' chains, freeing it at last. Luna then proceeds to use both "Ancient Fairy Dragon",  equipped  with " Pain to Power " and "Power Tool Dragon", equipped with " Rocket Pilder ", to destroy "Cusillu" and defeat Devack. After the Duel, Luna picks up the "Ancient Fairy Dragon" card and also finds a " Regulus " card.
 Following Crow's  Shadow Turbo Duel  against  Greiger , Luna along with her brother,  Trudge , and  Crow  himself witness the rematch between Yusei and Kalin Kessler. After the extreme Duel ends, Luna, Leo, and Trudge accompany Yusei as he decides to go to the Original Ener-D Reactor directly in order to Duel against  Roman  one more time.
 She watches the Duel between Yusei and Roman as it ends up with Yusei´s victory. After the Duel, she watches in horror as Roman blows up the bridge and drops Yusei into the Ener-D Reactor. Like the rest she´s glad, when Yusei returns, though unconscious. After he finally wakes up and that everyone eventually goes up through the same stairs they used before, they all notice purple sparks in the distance. She then knows that not only has Jack won, but also activated the third Tower.
 Knowing that the last Tower to be activated is Akiza´s task, Luna along with Leo, Trudge, and Yusei all go to where it is. Arriving at an old and abandoned carnival, they split and began looking for her and  Mina , except for the twins who look for them together. After Sayer awakens Akiza's power and is transformed once again into the Black Rose, they notice the tornado that has materialized on the carnival caused by the Synchro Summoning of " Black Rose Dragon ". As they get to the area where the Duel is taking place, they both notice Akiza´s powers having once again manifested even stronger. After Mina and Trudge arrive, they all watch the outcome of the match, with Akiza emerging victorious. However, they notice that its too late for the last Tower to be activated, as the sun has already set.
 The Condor geoglyph appears in the sky, while the  King of the Netherworld  revives from the Original Ener-D Reactor's crater.  Kuribon  appears to Luna, telling her that they mustn't let the King reach the Condor geoglyph. As the King begins moving towards it, the Crimson Dragon appears and transports Luna and her companions to Rex Goodwin's mansion, where the Condor geoglyph is located. Goodwin stands at the top of the  Stairway to the Dragon Star , where he reveals himself to be the final Dark Signer and attaches Roman's arm to himself.
 Goodwin declares that a Shadow Turbo Duel will be held within the Condor geoglyph as a ritual to welcome the King of the Netherworld. As Yusei, Jack, and Crow accept the Duel in order to stop the resurrection of the Underworld Ruler, Luna and the rest of the party cheer for them. However, when " Earthbound Immortal Wiraqocha Rasca " is Summoned, it tries to cheat by Summoning a flock of demonic black birds to attack Yusei, Jack, and Crow. Akiza and Luna are able to provide aid by manifesting "Black Rose Dragon" and "Ancient Fairy Dragon" to fight the horde.

 Relationships 
 Leo 
 Leo  and Luna share a very close bond with one another. Leo is the only one able to reach out to Luna in the  Duel Monsters Spirit World , the first time doing it when she was 3 and in a coma in the real world. Leo believed she could still hear him that time, and was able to eventually wake her up. When Luna was brought back to the Spirit world in the present, she didn't feel confident enough to protect it, but Leo vowed to protect her, while she protected it, and as a result she resumed her promise. [8] . They also look out for each other and help one another, as shown when Leo takes Luna's place Dueling  Devack  while she was in the Spirit World, and then does what she can after taking over for him. Luna has shown quite a few times that without Leo to support her, she'd be lost, and has even referred to him as her 'hero'. [9]  Their bond runs so deep that when her brother died against  Aporia , she screamed in misery and also began losing Life Points through a weakened heart pulse. [20]  As Life Points were tied to the Duelist's actual life, it is proven with this that she would literally die without her brother.
 After Leo awakened as a  Signer , Luna cried tears of joy, saying he would always protect her, and calling him her hero while looking at him adoringly. [21]  As the gang prepared to part ways, Luna comments on how much Leo has changed, stating that he's more of a man now, and referring to him as "big brother". [22] 
 
 Ancient Fairy Dragon 
 The ruler of the  Duel Monsters Spirit World  found Luna's spirit when she lapsed into a coma. Until she woke up,  Ancient Fairy Dragon  watched over her as if she was Luna's guardian angel. Luna vowed to protect the spirit world, but had to forsake that promise. She resumed keeping that promise after her Duel with  Professor Frank . [8]  After  Leo 's Duel against  Sayer , she turned to her for help. [23]  When she finally set her free during the Duel with  Devack , she thanked Luna for keeping her promise and supported her further in later Duels [9] [24] 
 
 Lester 
 Luna showed signs of having a small crush on  Lester  when he first enrolled at  Duel Academy . This included her blushing and looking away flustered when Lester first smiled at her. Her crush on him is further evident, as  Yusei  pointed out with a slight smile that it was odd for someone like her to be giving someone so much praise like that). [25]  However it was proven to be short-lived, because after Luna found out that Lester was the one hurting them, she was angry.
 
 Yusei Fudo 
 Yusei  has a friendly relationship with the twins as an older friend. She was initially wary of him because of his  criminal mark  and his status as an escapee from  Satellite . [26]  The twins eventually warm up to him and support him. After Luna woke up from her hypnosis by ending the Duel with  Professor Frank , she collapsed, and Yusei carried her away from the Dueling platform. Yusei also showed concern for her during her  Fortune Cup  Duel. When she woke up after the fight with Frank and got out of Yusei's arms, she replied she was okay, and Yusei told her to simply do what she wanted in a kind voice. [8] 
 
 Akiza Izinski 
 Luna believed  Akiza  to be misunderstood after using her abilities to "feel" Akiza's  Deck  and was disgusted at the crowd's attitude towards her for being a witch. [27]  After Akiza develops a bond with the  Signers , Luna seems to look up to her as an older sister figure, calling her "Aki-san". [28] [29] 
 
 Patty 
 Patty  is Luna's friend, usually seen hanging around her.
 
 Jack Atlas 
 Although not as clear as  her brother , Luna does seem to hold some respect for  Jack . Through the battle with  Aporia , it is also evident that Jack to some degree worries for Luna, as her heart weakens, he angrily curses at Aporia for harming such a small child. [20]
