 Lyrics 
 
 
 Rōmaji 
 
 English Translation 
 
 
 Karamitsuku jikan furikitte<br\>genkai made buttobashite<br\>girigiri no omoi tsunai dara yuku no sa my way 
 
 Once I tear myself away from the tangled web of time,<br\>make a break to the limits,<br\>and join together my desperate feelings, I'll go, my way. 
 
 
 Akaku tagiru jōnetsu daite<br\>monokuro no keshiki o nuke tara<br\>nonsutoppu de ikkini oikoshite yuke 
 
 With your passion boiling red,<br\>once you pass the monochromatic scenery,<br\>overtake it going full speed, nonstop 
 
 
 Dare yori mo hayaku tadori tsuki tai<br\>mamoru beki hito ga irukara 
 
 I wanna reach it faster than anyone else<br\>'Cause I got people I have to protect 
 
 
 Crazy, Keep on Driving!! Motto hageshiku<br\>hashire furikaeru koto nante deki nai One way Road<br\>Keep on Burning Soul!! Atsuku moyashite<br\>arashi no yō ni subete o ke chira se furusurottoru de<br\>yuku ze Clear Mind 
 
 Crazy, Keep on Driving!! More intense<br\>Drive on, it's a one way road where you can't turn back<br\>Keep on Burning Soul!! Make 'em burn hot,<br\>and just like a storm, get rid of all in your way, so at full throttle...<br\>Let's go, Clear Mind 
 
 
 Kodoku to fuan o hikizu ta<br\>muryoku na hibi bukkowashite<br\>mō dasshu de ima o tsukinukero naitecha no way 
 
 Shatter those days of feeling helpless<br\>and dragging your loneliness and fears<br\>Smash through the moment in a mad dash, and if you cry, no way 
 
 
 Me ni mienai nani ka ni obie<br\>gurippu kika nai kōnā ja<br\>mayoi wa kinmotsu da ze kakugo kanryo 
 
 On a corner where your grip slips,<br\>as you fear of something you can't see,<br\>indecision is forbidden, you're ready and set 
 
 
 Mada dare mo mita koto nai ashita e<br\>omae-zure kaze ni naru no sa 
 
 Towards a tomorrow no one's yet to have seen,<br\>I'll take you there and we'll be one with the winds 
 
 
 Don't Stop, Keep on Rolling!! Motto tōku e<br\>ki o nukeba inochi wa nai no sa buchikome Red Zone<br\>Keep on Burning Soul!! Iki teru kagiri<br\>hakanakute mo kagayaite itai furusupīdo de<br\>Yuku ze Clear Mind 
 
 Don't stop, Keep on Rolling!! Go even further on<br\>Ease up and it'll cost your life. Punch it into the Red Zone<br\>Keep on Burning Soul!! So long I live,<br\>Even if I die, I wanna shine, so at full speed...<br\>Let's go, Clear Mind 
 
 
 Crazy, Keep on Driving!! Motto hageshiku<br\>hashire furikaeru koto nante dekinai One way Road<br\>Don't Stop, Keep on Rolling!! Motto tōku e<br\>ki o nukeba inochi wa nai no sa buchikome Red Zone<br\>Keep on Burning Soul!! Atsuku moyashite<br\>arashi no yō ni subete o ke chirase furusurottoru de furusupīdo de<br\>iku ze Clear Mind 
 
 Crazy, Keep on Driving!! More intense<br\>Drive on, it's a one way road where you can't turn back<br\>Don't stop, keep on rolling!! Go even further on<br\>Ease up and it'll cost your life. Punch it into the Red Zone<br\>Keep on Burning Soul!! Make 'em burn hot,<br\>and just like a storm, get rid of all in your way, so at full throttle, at full speed...<br\>Let's go, Clear Mind
