 Synopsis 
 Joey faces Marik in the Semi-Finals and is determined to save Mai and the world. Marik plunges them into a Shadow Game where they will feel the pain of their destroyed monsters. Can Joey defeat Marik or will the Shadow Realm claim his energy?
 
 
 Major events 
 First Duel of the  Battle City  Semi-Finals. 
 This is a  Shadow Game  with upped stakes.  Marik  makes it so that "dark energy strings" connect Marik and  Joey  to each monster they summon. As a monster is destroyed or weakened, a corresponding amount of "damage" is dealt to the monster's owner. As it turns out, Joey is the only one whose physical energy is visibly affected, albeit not as badly as Marik had expected. 
 Featured Duel: Marik Ishtar vs. Joey Wheeler - Part 1 
 Turn 1: Yami Marik 
Yami Marik draws " Gil Garth " and subsequently Normal Summons it (1800/1200) in  Attack Position . He then  Sets  a card (" Dark Wall of Wind ").
 Turn 2: Joey Wheeler 
Joey draws "Alligator's Sword".  Joey 's  hand  contains " Scapegoat ", " Rocket Warrior ", " Graceful Dice ", " Foolish Burial ", " Baby Dragon " and " Alligator's Sword ". He then  Sets  a card and Joey  Normal Summons  "Alligator's Sword" (1500/1200) in  Defense Position .
 Turn 3: Yami Marik 
Yami Marik draws. He then  Normal Summons  " Drillago " (1600/1100) in  Attack Position . "Drillago" attacks and  destroys  "Alligator's Sword". "Gil Garth" attacks directly, but Joey activates his face-down "Scapegoat" to  Special Summon  four " Sheep Tokens " (0/0 for each) in  Defense Position . "Gil Garth" destroys a "Sheep Token".
 Turn 4: Joey Wheeler 
Joey draws " Panther Warrior " and subsequently Normal Summons it (2000/1600) in  Attack Position . He then  Tributes  a "Sheep Token" to allow "Panther Warrior" to attack. "Panther Warrior" attacks and destroys "Gil Garth" ( Marik  4000 → 3800).
 Turn 5: Yami Marik 
Yami Marik draws "Hidden Soldiers".  Marik 's hand contains " Card of Last Will ", "Tribute Burial", "Plasma Eel", "Helpoemer" and "Hidden Soldiers". Yami Marik  activates  " Tribute Burial " to  remove from play  "Alligator's Sword" from  Joey 's  Graveyard  and "Gil Garth" from his own Graveyard in order to  Normal Summon  " Helpoemer " (2000/1400) in  Attack Position  without Tributing. Yami Marik then  sets  a card.
 Turn 6: Joey Wheeler 
Joey draws " Jinzo ". He then  Normal Summons  "Rocket Warrior" (1500/1300) in  Attack Position .  Marik  then  activates  his face-down " Hidden Soldiers " to  Special Summon  " Plasma Eel " (500/1200) in  Attack Position  since Joey Normal Summoned a monster. Yami Marik activates the effect of "Plasma Eel" to equip the latter to "Panther Warrior". "Rocket Warrior" attacks "Helpoemer". Due to the effect of "Rocket Warrior", it is not destroyed and Joey takes no Battle Damage. After damage calculation, the final effect of "Rocket Warrior" reduces the ATK of "Helpoemer"  ATK  by 500 until the end of the turn ("Helpoemer": 2000 → 1500/1400). 
 Joey then  Tributes  a "Sheep Token" to allow "Panther Warrior" to attack. "Panther Warrior" attacks and destroys "Helpoemer" ( Marik  3800 → 3300). Since "Helpoemer" was sent to the  Graveyard  as a result of battle, Joey is now forced to randomly discard a card from his hand at the end of each of his  Battle Phases  so long as "Helpoemer" is in the Graveyard. At the end of the Battle Phase, the effect of "Helpoemer" forces  Joey  to discard "Jinzo".
 Duel continues next episode. 
 
 Changes to the English dub 
 The pincers on " Plasma Eel " are made glowy in the dub. 
 Cut from the dub is "Plasma Eel" digging into the head of " Panther Warrior " and the latter twitching. 
 The violence against the " Sheep Tokens " is obscured in the dub. 
 The cross of " Helpoemer " is changed to a slab in the English version. 
 A shot of  Yami Marik  gagging after Helpoemer is struck by the effect of " Rocket Warrior " is also removed from the dub.
