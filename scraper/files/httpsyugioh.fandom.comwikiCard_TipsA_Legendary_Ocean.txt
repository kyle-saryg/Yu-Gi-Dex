 This card can be  searched  by " Dark Sage ", " Ancient Gear Drill ", " Angmarl the Fiendish Monarch ", " Left Arm Offering ", " Terraforming ", " An Owl of Luck ", " Demise of the Land ", " Madolche Butlerusk ", " Planet Pathfinder ", " Pop-Up ", " Set Rotation ", " Ocean Dragon Lord - Kairyu-Shin ", and " Warrior of Atlantis ". 
 This card works well with " Gravity Bind " and/or " Level Limit - Area B ". It allows  WATER   monsters  that were originally Level 4 to still be able to attack.
 " Mermaid Knight " and " Amphibious Bugroth MK-3 " both work well in this strategy. 
 This card also works well with Level 5 or 7 WATER monsters, since they can be  Normal Summoned  with one less  Tribute  while this card is  face-up . " Dinomist Spinos " and " Levia-Dragon - Daedalus " are good cards to use for this, as the former will have the most  ATK  you can Normal Summon using this effect, and the latter can perform a  field wipe  after it's Summoned. 
 This card also works well with WATER  Ritual Monsters  (especially of the " Gishki " and " Nekroz " archetypes), lowering their Tribute requirements by one Level each. 
 Traditional Format 
 This card can be searched by " Ancient Fairy Dragon ".
