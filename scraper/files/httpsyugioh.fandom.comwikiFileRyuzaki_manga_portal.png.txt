 Rex Raptor , known as  Dinosaur Ryuzaki  in the manga and Japanese  anime , is a  Dinosaur   Duelist . Despite his introduction as a powerful Duelist, he becomes a source of humiliation along with his companion,  Weevil Underwood , after suffering defeat to  Joey Wheeler , and begins considering Joey his rival for this reason. He is also briefly the companion to  Mai Valentine , as she was trying to use him to get her revenge on Joey for defeating her. Though Rex is vindictive, arrogant, and tyrannical, he plays fairly unlike his cheating companion Weevil, and he forfeited his rarest and most prized card " Red-Eyes B. Dragon " to Joey after he lost it fair and square when he anted it in the hopes that he'd win Joey's " Time Wizard " should he lose, as he was planning on double-crossing Mai by using Time Wizard to defeat her, as his own form of revenge against her.

 Design 
         Rex's design incorporates multiple layers of clothing and a wide range of expressions. Depicted here is the  Duelist  in full regalia from front and side views and alongside views of his head from different angles.     
 Rex's character design was overseen by  Kazuki Takahashi . His usual outfit consists of a green jacket and a red beanie cap, plus tan pants. In Duelist kingdom, he wears a tan vest-thing on his jacket, and a black shirt. In Battle City onward, he wears a green jacket, and a yellow shirt. His hair is brown with dyed purple strands next to his forehead. He has purple-blue eyes, whenever his irises are shown (his pupils are usually too small to determine his eye color). He carries a  KaibaCorp   Duel Disk  on his left hand. In the  Waking the Dragons  arc, he has a  Chaos Duel Disk .
 In the  Yu-Gi-Oh! (1999 flim) , Ryuzaki has black hair with dyed pink strands and a purple cap.
 
 Voice and mannerisms 
 In the original anime, Rex speaks with a Kansai accent. In the Dutch dub, he has a Flemish accent.
 
 Etymology 
 "Dinosaur" is a nickname; "Ryuzaki" is his given name. In the dub, he is named after the Tyrannosaurus Rex and the Velociraptor, 2 types of dinosaurs.

 Duelist Kingdom 
 Rex, as the Western Japan Representative, participates in the Japanese National  Duel Monsters  tournament, where he loses to  Weevil Underwood  in the finals though Rex is implied to have thrown the match alongside Weevil likely stacking his deck.
 Rex was invited to the  Duelist Kingdom  tournament. Being a runner-up in the last tournament, he was one of the few participants given a room on the boat journey. He invited  Mai Valentine  to his room. Mai challenged him to a  Duel , where she would give him a kiss if he won (do anything he wants for him the Japanese Version), but she would get the room to herself if she wins. 
 Confident that he wouldn't lose, Rex accepts. However Mai insisted that they use her cards. Unbeknownst to Rex, Mai sprayed them with different perfumes and was able to tell what cards he drew. With this advantage, Mai won and booted Rex out of the room.
 During the tournament, he was constantly berated by the fact Mai had more  Star Chips  than him. He challenged her to a Duel to get revenge but Mai, preferring to avoid him, was content to use the excuse that she had already "beaten" him once. However since Mai had previously lost to  Joey Wheeler  and considered it obnoxious to challenge him again, she agreed to Duel Rex, if he defeated Joey for her.
 During his Duel with Joey, Rex gambled " Red-Eyes Black Dragon " in the hopes of winning Joey's " Time Wizard ". (In the Japanese anime, "Red-Eyes Black Dragon" was an incredibly rare card that took all his savings to obtain.) This infuriated Mai as it would mean Rex's  Deck  would be even stronger if she had to face him. However, Joey won the Duel and he claimed Rex's star chips along with his "Red-Eyes Black Dragon" and his " Dragon Nails ".
 
 Battle City 
 In the  Battle City  arc, he was seen briefly, losing to  Espa Roba , who cheated and had " Jinzo " crush Rex's " Serpent Night Dragon ". Rex then advised Joey on Roba's strength and left the tournament afterwards.
 He later observed the semifinal match between Yugi and Kaiba in Domino City, amongst other Duelists.
 
 Waking The Dragons 
         Rex with a  Chaos Duel Disk     
 In the  Waking the Dragons  arc, it was revealed that he and  Weevil  lost a good deal of their popularity after the tournament and they eventually ended up wandering  Domino City  where they were ambushed by  Gurimo . Their souls were taken, and later released when  Yugi Muto  defeated him.
 The two of them then trailed after the party until Yugi's soul was taken by  Rafael  and they begged him to take them on their Helicopter. Rafael and  Alister  took them to  Dartz , who agreed to give them power if they passed the necessary test. Each of them was given a piece of the  Orichalcos Stone  and both must succeed in grasping them, which both of them did. 
 Rex and Weevil improved their  Decks  by taking cards from Dartz's massive collection and Rex challenged Joey to a rematch. During the Duel, Joey used Rex's "Red-Eyes Black Dragon" against him, much to Rex's displeasure and anger. Despite using " The Seal of Orichalcos " Rex lost at the hands of Joey's " Gearfried the Swordmaster ", sending his soul to Dartz again. He was released at the end of the arc when Dartz was defeated. He and Weevil fled from the hospital they found themselves in.
 Sebastian Arcelus replaces Sam Riegel as Rex's voice for this season, which is why Rex's voice is higher pitched than it was in seasons 1, 2 and 3.
 
 Grand Championship 
 Their next plan was to enter the  KaibaCorp   Grand Championship , where they both impersonated  Fortune Salim . They were quickly defeated by  Zigfried von Schroeder  and sent back to Japan by KaibaCorp. (In the dub, their fate after the Duel is unknown, although they were briefly seen after Yugi defeats  Leon von Schroeder , possibly in  Domino City , watching in disgust, indicating that they were sent back.)
 
 Dawn of the Duel 
 Rex and Weevil's last attempt at revenge was to steal Yugi's  Egyptian God Cards  from his house, where they mistakenly grabbed Yugi's bag containing all of his  Millennium Items . Yugi tried to stop them, but couldn't catch up. While examining their prize, they were sent to the Shadow Realm by Yami Bakura, who stole the Millennium Ring back from them afterwards. While Zorc's rampage over Ancient Egypt was in full swing, the events then were affecting the modern world as well- where Rex was shown clinging on to a pole so to not to blown away by the wind. After Zorc's defeat, he was also seen.
 Rex is shown in the last episode of Yu-Gi-Oh! Dueling with  Weevil  (cut from the dub).
 
 Yu-Gi-Oh! 5D's 
 In  Yu-Gi-Oh! 5D's , a parody of him named Dinosaur Hakozaki is listed as one the Duelists defeated by  Hunter Pace . [1] 
 
 Deck 
 Main article:  Rex Raptor's Decks 
 Rex Raptor chiefly employs a  "Dinosaur Power Deck"  focused on mainly low level Dinosaur-Type monsters and high level Dragon-Type Monsters. His dueling strategy involves offensive  Beatdown  tactics, concentrating on using high ATK-powered Dinosaur monsters to bring down his opponent's Life Points as quickly as possible. In addition, he makes use of a confluence of Dinosaur-support Magic and Trap cards to augment on the brute power of his Dinosaurs on the dueling field.  Though his signature cards are centralized around Dinosaurs, his strongest monsters tend to be Dragon-Types, such as the  Red-Eyes Black Dragon ,  Serpent Night Dragon , and  Tyrant Dragon  (probably because, at the time, there weren't that many strong Dinosaur type monsters).
