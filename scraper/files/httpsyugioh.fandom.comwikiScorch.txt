 Personality 
 Like his brother,  Chills , Scorch is a violent, rude thug. He shows little respect for other members of his gang, save Chills, and cheats in Duels. Under the influence of " Volcasaurus ", he believed himself capable of doing anything with impunity. He demonstrates a large amount of loyalty to Chills as well. After losing to  Yuma Tsukumo  and  Shark , his personality changes drastically, and he runs off in fear.
 
 Biography 
 Their gang took in  Shark  after he quit Dueling, explaining that Shark's former fame would be of use to the gang. When  Yuma Tsukumo ,  Tori Meadows  and  Bronk Stone  come to their  arcade  hideout looking for Shark, he catches Bronk by surprise and grabs him in a choke-hold, letting him go when Shark asks him to. [1] 
 Scorch and Chills later learn of a rare  Deck  being put on display in a museum, featuring " Chaos End Ruler - Ruler of the Beginning and the End ", and set out to steal it with Shark in tow (planning to frame Shark for the theft).  Another gang member  informed Yuma of their attempt, allowing Yuma to intercept them and challenge them both to a Duel, betting his own " Number ", " Number 39: Utopia ". Scroch and Chills are surprised that there are "Numbers" other than theirs. Shark teams up with Yuma, making it a 2-on-2  Tag-Team Duel . [2]  During the Duel, Shark correctly guesses that Scorch and Chills had cheated by turning off their  D-Pad 's  shuffling  function and placing their cards in a set order so that they know which cards they will draw, allowing Scorch to Summon his "Number" with ease early on. After Chills loses due to protecting him, Scorch angrily attempts to finish Yuma and Shark off, but Yuma is able to reduce the damage they take and Shark ends Scorch's  Battle Phase . Yuma and Shark able to beat him with Shark's " Armored Xyz ". After he and Chills lost, the two thugs ran away from Shark in fear, having lost the influence from the "Number" cards. [3] 
 
 Deck 
 Scorch uses a  Burn / FIRE - Dinosaur  Deck  focused on beatdown tactics. His Deck works hand-in-hand with  Chills ', with Scorch's being more on the offensive side. He also uses a large amount of  support  for  Level 5 Monster Cards . His Deck was spearheaded by " Number 61: Volcasaurus " until it was absorbed by  Astral . All of his Dinosaur  Monster Cards  have the "-saurus" suffix while Chills' dinosaurs have the "-don" suffix.
