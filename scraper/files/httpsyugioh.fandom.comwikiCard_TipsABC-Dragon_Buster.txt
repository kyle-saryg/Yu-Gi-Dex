 All three Materials can be Summoned with " Ties of the Brethren ". Despite the fact this card cannot be Special Summoned during the same turn "Ties of the Brethren" was activated, it can be Summoned during the next turn, regardless if the 3 Materials are still on the field or if the opponent managed to send them to the Graveyard. 
 It is now possible to summon this card in one turn with just " Union Hangar " and " Unauthorized Reactivation " in your hand. 
 " A-Assault Core ", " B-Buster Drake " and " C-Crush Wyvern " can be sent to the Graveyard as  Link Material  so that this card can be Summoned to a Main Monster Zone. 
 If this card's effect is used while " Saffira, Queen of Dragons " is on your field, by discarding a LIGHT monster, "Saffira" can become a draw engine for the deck. 
 " Union Scramble " can be used to Special Summon "A", "B" and "C", so that they can be equipped to this card and grant it immunities against card effects and destruction by battle. 
 This card can be Tributed for the Special Summon of a " Kaiju ", so that the opponent doesn't have the chance to Special Summon "A", "B" and "C".
 Alternatively, " System Down " can be used. Unlike with other mass removal cards such as " Raigeki ", if the opponent attempts to have this card dodge the destruction, the materials will simply be banished upon being Summoned. 
 Traditional Format 
 " Painful Choice " can be used to quickly gather the materials for this card.
