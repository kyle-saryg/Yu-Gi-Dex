 Featured Duel: Yami Yugi  Vs  Gurimo 
 Turn 1: Yami Yugi 
Yami Yugi draws " Beta The Magnet Warrior " and subsequently Normal Summons it (1700/1600) in  Defense Position . He then  Sets  a card.
 Turn 2: Gurimo 
Gurimo draws. He then  Normal Summons  " Marauding Captain " (1200/400) in  Attack Position . Since "Marauding Captain" was Normal Summoned, its effect activates, allowing Gurimo to  Special Summon  " Shadow Tamer " (800/700) in  Attack Position . Gurimo then activates " The Seal of Orichalcos ". Now all of Gurimo's monsters will gain 500  ATK  and the loser of the Duel will lose his soul ("Marauding Captain" 1200 → 1700/400) ("Shadow Tamer" 800 → 1300/700) and the monsters on Gurimo's side look more sinister and their eyes low red. Yami Yugi tries to destroy the seal but fails to do so. Gurimo tells him that the Seal of Orichalcos can't be destroyed until either he or Yami Yugi loses.
 "Marauding Captain" attacks and destroys "Beta The Magnet Warrior".  Yami Yugi  then activates his face-down " Soul Rope " to pay 1000 Life Points (Yugi 4000 → 3000) and  Special Summon  " Gamma The Magnet Warrior " (1500/1800) in  Defense Position . [Notes 1]  Gurimo's hand contains " Makyura the Destructor ", " Hidden Soldiers ", and " Obelisk the Tormentor ". Gurimo then  Sets  a card.
 Turn 3: Yami Yugi 
Yami Yugi draws " Alpha The Magnet Warrior " and subsequently Normal Summons it (1400/1700) in  Attack Position . Gurimo activates his face-down "Hidden Soldiers" to  Special Summon  "Makyura the Destructor" (1600 → 2100/1200) from his hand in  Attack Position  as Yami Yugi Normal Summoned a monster. 
 Yami Yugi then  activates  " The Shallow Grave " to allow both players to  Special Summon  a monster from their  Graveyard  in  Defense Position . Yami Yugi Special Summons "Beta The Magnet Warrior" (1700/1600) in Defense Position while Gurimo doesn't Special Summon anything due to his  Graveyard  being currently empty. [Notes 2] 
 Yami Yugi then  Tributes  "Alpha The Magnet Warrior", "Beta The Magnet Warrior", and "Gamma The Magnet Warrior" in order to  Special Summon  " Valkyrion the Magna Warrior " (3500/3850) in  Attack Position . "Valkyrion the Magna Warrior"  attacks  and  destroys  "Marauding Captain" (Gurimo 4000 → 2200).
 Turn 4: Gurimo 
Gurimo draws " Monster Reborn " and subsequently activates it to  Special Summon  "Marauding Captain" (1200 → 1700/400) from the  Graveyard  in  Attack Position . Gurimo then  Tributes  "Makyura the Destructor", "Shadow Tamer", and "Marauding Captain" in order to  Tribute Summon  " Obelisk the Tormentor " (4000 → 4500/4000) in  Attack Position . "Obelisk the Tormentor"  attacks  and  destroys   Yami Yugi 's " Valkyrion the Magna Warrior " ( Yami Yugi  3000 → 2000).
 Turn 5: Yami Yugi 
Yami Yugi draws " Graceful Charity " and subsequently  activates  it to  draw  three cards and  discard  two cards (" Collected Power " and "Dark Magician"). The remaining cards in Yugi's hand are "Gazelle the King of Mythical Beasts", "Dark Renewal", and "Monster Reborn". Yami Yugi then  Normal Summons  " Gazelle the King of Mythical Beasts " (1500/1200) in  Defense Position  and  Sets  a card.
 Turn 6: Gurimo 
Gurimo draws. He then Sets a card. "Obelisk the Tormentor" attacks and destroys Yami's "Gazelle the King of Mythical Beasts".
 Turn 7: Yami Yugi 
Yami Yugi draws "Brave Attack". He then activates " Monster Reborn " to revive "Valkyrion the Magna Warrior" (3500/3850) in  Attack Position . Yami Yugi then  Tributes  "Valkyrion the Magna Warrior" via its own effect to  Special Summon  " Alpha The Magnet Warrior " (1400/1700), " Beta The Magnet Warrior " (1700/1600), and " Gamma The Magnet Warrior " (1500/1800) from his  Graveyard  in  Attack Position . 
 Yami Yugi then activates " Brave Attack " to add together the ATK of all three "Magnet Warriors" during one battle this turn (The ATK of the three "Magnet Warriors" combined: 1400 + 1700 + 1500 = 4600 ATK). The three "Magnet Warriors" attack and destroy "Obelisk" ( Gurimo  2200 → 2100). Due to the effect of "Brave Attack", the three "Magnet Warriors" are destroyed at the end of the  Battle Phase .
 Turn 8: Gurimo 
Gurimo draws " Card of Sanctity " and subsequently  activates  it to force both players to  draw  until they are holding six cards in their  hand . (Gurimo and Yami Yugi both draw six cards each). Yugi's hand at this point contains "Watapon", "Dark Magician Girl", Queen's Knight", "Kuriboh", "Magical Academy", and an unknown Spell card [Notes 3] . Since Yami Yugi drew " Watapon " through a card effect, he  Special Summons  it from his hand (200/300) in  Defense Position  via its own effect. 
 Gurimo then Normal Summons " Warrior Dai Grepher " (1700 → 2200/1600) in  Attack Position . Yami Yugi then activates his face-down " Dark Renewal " to  Tribute  "Warrior Dai Grepher" and "Watapon" in order to  Special Summon  " Dark Magician " (2500/2100) from the  Graveyard  in  Attack Position  (Yami Yugi explains to Gurimo that "Dark Magician" was one of the cards that he discarded earlier due to "Graceful Charity"). Gurimo Sets a card.
 Turn 9: Yami Yugi 
Yami Yugi draws. "Dark Magician" attacks Gurimo  directly , but Gurimo activates his face-down " Shield Wall " to  Special Summon  four " Shield Tokens " (0 → 500/1000 for all) in  Defense Position . A  replay  occurs, and " Dark Magician " attacks and destroys one " Shield Token ". 
 Gurimo activates his face-down " Bronze Knights " to discard three cards and  Special Summon  three " Bronze Knight Tokens " (500 → 1000/500) in  Attack Position . Due to the effect of " The Seal of Orichalcos ", Gurimo can place them in the  Spell & Trap Card Zone  (because he can use his  Spell & Trap Card Zones  as added  Monster Card Zones ); now the " Bronze Knight Tokens " cannot be attacked until Gurimo's " Shield Tokens " (in the front row) are destroyed first. Yami Yugi then Sets two cards and  Normal Summons  " Queen's Knight " (1500/1600) in  Defense Position .
 Turn 10: Gurimo 
Gurimo draws. Yami Yugi activates his face-down " Dust Tornado " to destroy Gurimo's " The Seal of Orichalcos ". However, "The Seal of Orichalcos" cannot be destroyed by  card effects , so it doesn't work. Gurimo then activates " The Warrior Returning Alive " to add "Warrior Dai Grepher" from his  Graveyard  to his hand. Gurimo then  Normal Summons  "Warrior Dai Grepher" (1700 → 2200/1600) in  Attack Position , and in the  Spell & Trap Card Zone . 
 Gurimo then activates " Allied Forces ". Now all of Gurimo's  Warrior - Type  monsters gain 200  ATK  for each  Warrior - Type  and  Spellcaster - Type  monster on his side of the Field. Gurimo currently controls four  Warrior - Type  Monsters ("Bronze Knight Tokens": 1000 → 1800/500; "Warrior Dai Grepher": 2200 → 3000/1600) [Notes 4] 
 "Warrior Dai Grepher" attacks and destroys "Dark Magician" ( Yami Yugi  2000 → 1500). One " Bronze Knight Token " attacks "Queen's Knight", but Yami Yugi activates his face-down " Magical Academy " to discard two cards and perform a Normal Summon immediately this turn. Yami Yugi Tributes "Queen's Knight" in order to  Tribute Summon  " Dark Magician Girl " (2000/1700) from his Hand in  Attack Position . Due to the effect of "Magical Academy", " Dark Magician Girl " gains 500  ATK  ("Dark Magician Girl": 2000 → 2500/1700) and its Level increases by two ("Dark Magician Girl": Level 6 → 8). Since "Queen's Knight" left the field, the Bronze Knight Token's attack is negated as it lost its original target. Also, since there is a "Dark Magician" in Yami Yugi's  Graveyard , "Dark Magician Girl" gains 300 more  ATK  due to its own effect ("Dark Magician Girl": 2500 → 2800/1700).
 Turn 11: Yami Yugi 
Yami Yugi draws " Diffusion Wave-Motion " and subsequently  activates  it to  pay  1000 Life Points ( Yami Yugi  1500 → 500) and allow " Dark Magician Girl " to attack every monster Gurimo controls once each.
 "Dark Magician Girl"  attacks  and  destroys  the three "Shield Tokens". "Dark Magician Girl" then  attacks  and  destroys  the first "Bronze Knight Token" ( Gurimo  2100 → 1100) (second and third "Bronze Knight Tokens": 1800 → 1600/500; "Warrior Dai Grepher": 3000 → 2800/1600). "Dark Magician Girl"  attacks  and  destroys  the second "Bronze Knight Token" ( Gurimo  1100 → 0) (third "Bronze Knight Token": 1600 → 1400/500; "Warrior Dai Grepher": 2800 → 2600/1600). [Notes 5]  "Dark Magician Girl"  attacks  and  destroys  the third "Bronze Knight Token" ( Gurimo  0 → 0) ("Warrior Dai Grepher": 2600 → 2400/1600). "Dark Magician Girl"  attacks  and  destroys  "Warrior Dai Grepher" ( Gurimo  0 → 0).
 Yami wins.
 
 Aftermath 
 Though Yami Yugi won, Gurimo returns Obelisk the Tormentor to his master before his soul was extracted by the Seal of Orichalcos. Weevil and Rex's souls also return to their respective bodies.
 The next morning, Yugi is hugged by a ten-year-old girl with long blonde hair and glasses. Yugi does not know who she is until she shows him  The Ties of Friendship . They soon recognize her as  Rebecca Hawkins , who now no longer wears pigtails and wears glasses. After some catching up they head to the Domino Museum.
