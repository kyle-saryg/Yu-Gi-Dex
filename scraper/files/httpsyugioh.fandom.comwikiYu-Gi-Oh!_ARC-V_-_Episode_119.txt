 Featured Duels 
 Shay Obsidian vs. Lulu Obsidian 
       Lulu  vs.  Shay .     
 At the start of the  Duel , the  Field Spell Card  " Crossover " is  activated , as per the rules of an  Action Duel . It will allow the players to use  Action Cards , but they may only have one in their  hand  at a time.
 Turn 1: Shay 
 Shay   Normal Summons  " Raidraptor - Vanishing Lanius " (1300/1600). As it was Normal Summoned this  turn , Shay activates its  effect  to  Special Summon  another copy of it from his hand. Shay activates the effect of the " Raidraptor - Retrofit Lanius " in his hand, allowing him to substitute it for any " Raidraptor " monster he controls, so he Special Summons it (800/1200), treated as "Vanishing Lanius". The other effect of "Retrofit Lanius", allows it to be treated as two  Overlay Units  for the  Xyz Summon  of a "Raidraptor" monster, so Shay  overlays  his three  Level  4  monsters  to Xyz Summon " Raidraptor - Rise Falcon " (100/2000). Shay  Sets  a card.
 Turn 2: Lulu 
 Lulu   draws  and subsequently Normal Summons " Lyrilusc - Cobalt Sparrow " (0/100). Lulu's hand contains another copy of "Cobalt Sparrow", two copies of " Lyrilusc - Sapphire Swallow ", " Lyrilusc - Bird Song " and " Lyrilusc - Bird Strike ". Lulu activates the effect of the "Sapphire Swallow" in her hand, as she  controls  a " Lyrilusc " monster other than "Sapphire Swallow". She can Special Summon it along with a  Level  1 "Lyrilusc" monster from her hand. She Special Summons "Sapphire Swallow" (100/0) and another copy of "Cobalt Sparrow" (0/100). As "Cobalt Sparrow" was Special Summoned, its effect activates, letting Lulu  add  another copy of it from her  Deck  to her hand. She activates the effect of another copy of "Sapphire Swallow", Special Summoning it (100/0) and the added "Cobalt Sparrow" (0/100). Lulu overlays her five Level 1 monsters to Xyz Summon " Lyrilusc - Assembled Nightingale ". "Assembled Nightingale" gains 100  ATK  for each Overlay Unit it has, and it can attack  directly  a number of times for each of its Overlay Units ("Assembled Nightingale": 0 → 500 ATK). "Assembled Nightingale" attacks directly five times (Shay: 4000 → 3500 → 3000 → 2500 → 2000 → 1500 LP).
 Turn 3: Shay 
Shay draws and subsequently activates " Rank-Up-Magic Raid Force ", allowing him to  Rank-Up  a "Raidraptor" monster he controls, using it as the Overlay Unit. He Ranks-Up "Rise Falcon" and performs a  Rank-Up Xyz Evolution  to Xyz Summon " Raidraptor - Blaze Falcon " (1000/2000) in Attack Position. Shay activates the effect of "Blaze Falcon", detaching an Overlay Unit to destroy all monsters Lulu controls and inflict 500  damage  for each one. Lulu activates the effect of "Assembled Nightingale", detaching an Overlay Unit to prevent its destruction ("Assembled Nightingale": 500 → 400 ATK). The other effect of "Blaze Falcon" allows it to attack directly, but Lulu activates the effect of "Assembled Nightingale" to reduce the  battle damage  to 0 and prevent it from being destroyed ("Assembled Nightingale": 400 → 300 ATK).
 Turn 4: Lulu 
Lulu draws " Fusion Parasite ". "Assembled Nightingale" attacks directly three times (Shay: 1500 → 1200 → 900 → 600 LP). As a "Lyrilusc" monster inflicted battle damage, Lulu activates "Lyrilusc - Bird Song", letting her she Special Summon a Level 1 monster from her hand in  Defense Position . She Special Summons "Fusion Parasite" (0/0). As it was Special Summoned, Lulu activates the effect of "Fusion Parasite"; she can  Fusion Summon  using it and a monster she controls or in her hand as  Fusion Materials , and it can be  substituted for any Fusion Material . After the Fusion Summon, "Fusion Parasite" will be  equipped  to the Summoned monster and if that monster would be destroyed, "Fusion Parasite" can be destroyed instead. She  fuses  "Fusion Parasite", treated as "Assembled Nightingale", with "Assembled Nightingale" as a "Lyrilusc" monster, to Fusion Summon " Lyrilusc - Independent Nightingale " (1000/0)
 "Independent Nightingale" gains one Level for each Overlay Unit "Assembled Nightingale" had before the Fusion Summon ("Independent Nightingale" 1 → 4) and it gains 500 ATK for each Level it has ("Independent Nightingale": 1000 → 3000 ATK). "Independent Nightingale" attacks "Blaze Falcon". As a "Raidraptor" monster he controls was attacked, Shay activates his face-down " Raidraptor - Evasive ", letting him  return  one of the monster's Overlay Units to his hand to  negate  the attack. Lulu activates the effect of "Independent Nightingale" to inflict 500 damage to Shay for each Level it has, but Shay finds and activates the  Action Card  " Acceleration " to reduce that effect damage to 0. As she controls a  face-up  "Lyrilusc" monster, Lulu activates "Lyrilusc  - Bird Strike" to negate the effects of all monsters her opponent controls. 
 Turn 5: Shay 
Shay draws " Little Fairy " and subsequently Normal Summons it. He activates its effect twice,  sending  a card from his hand to the Graveyard to increase its Level by 1 for each card ("Little Fairy" 3 → 4 → 5). He activates " Cross Xyz ", allowing him to Xyz Summon using an Xyz Monster and another monster he controls that has the same Level as the Xyz Monster's Rank. The Xyz Monster's Rank will be treated as a Level. Shay overlays his two Level 5 monsters to Xyz Summon " Raidraptor - Stranger Falcon " (2000/2000). He activates its effect, detaching an Overlay Unit to destroy a monster Lulu controls and inflict damage to her equal to that monster's ATK. Lulu tries to use the effect of "Fusion Parasite" to prevent the destruction of "Independent Nightingale", but is stopped by her subconsciousness. [Notes 1]  "Independent Nightingale" is destroyed (Lulu: 4000 → 1000 LP). "Stranger Falcon" attacks directly (Lulu: 1000 → 0 LP).
 
 Sylvio Sawatari and Crow Hogan vs. Emma and Jacob 
 Turn 1: Sylvio 
 Sylvio  is about to start his  turn , but the  Battle Beast  intrudes in the Duel (Battle Beast: 4000 → 2000 LP).
 Duel continues in the next episode .
