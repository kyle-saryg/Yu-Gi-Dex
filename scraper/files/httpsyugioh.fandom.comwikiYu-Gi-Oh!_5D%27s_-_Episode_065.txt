 Summary 
 Intro 
       The tablet falling towards Earth.     
 In outer space, a giant stone tablet tumbles down towards the Earth in the direction of Japan. An infinity symbol is shown and fades away as a shot of the city appears. In the background construction continues on one of many bridges.
 Yusei rides his  Duel Runner  along one of the bridges, narrating that it has been six months since the battle against the  Dark Signers  and that  the city  and  Satellite  are now connected.
 
 
 Lazar's investigation 
 At  Sector Security  headquarters,  Lazar  starts to panic that the new Director of the Public Security Bureau has not shown up and the possibility of the  Ghosts . After receiving a phone call, his panic starts to amplify.
 
       Lazar held at swordpoint by the robed men.     
 Three white hooded figures arrive at the crater formed by the tablet and gaze up at the stone structure, which remains intact. The trio consists of a  old man , a  young adult , while  the third  looks more child-like. Each of them have something covering one of their eyes except for the old man, who has a thing covering his mouth. Sirens are heard, as Lazar and a group of Securities pull up in squad cars. Lazar makes his way over to the trio, demanding to know their identities, but the younger adult member points a sword at him. The child-like one speaks a bit and starts to titter. Lazar realizes who they are and drops to his hands and knees, bowing to them, seeing that they are members of  Iliaster  (in the dub, the child informs Lazar that they will all act as the new Directors).
 
 
 Mina and Trudge's investigation 
       Mina and Trudge as they are shown the mangled Duel Runner.     
 At night time, a man on a  Duel Runner  gets chased by a  monster , who is barely visible in his visor. Later that night, Security are investigating the incident, where they now have the man in a body bag (cut from the dub).  Mina  and  Trudge , who has been promoted to chief, arrive at the scene and show their IDs, granting them entry. They are shown the man's now very mangled Duel Runner.
 Later over at  Yusei ,  Crow  and  Jack's  basement, the boys are working on a new  Duel Runner  engine. Crow, dressed in his  Blackbird Delivery  outfit, challenges Jack to a race. Jack is mounted on the new Duel Runner, which is fixed in its spot. He says he won't lose to Crow and continues to push the speed of the Runner. Yusei warns him to stop before it overloads, but Jack can't hear him over the noise and continues to accelerate, resulting in an explosion. Outside, clouds of smoke burst out of the building, startling many people in the area. Inside everyone is okay, but the Runner is now in pieces. As Crow and Jack start to bicker, people gather around an overhead window, starting down at them. An old lady named  Zora  appears at the entrance to the basement and starts yelling at Jack and Crow for causing such a commotion. After spotting Yusei, she calms down and starts to act more affectionately.
 Trudge and Mina's squad car pulls up outside the residence. They start to talk with Yusei, Jack and Crow. Yusei shows the remains of the Duel Runner, they'd been working on, while Crow and Jack tell them of their plans to enter the  World Turbo Grand Prix . Trudge tells them about the  Ghost , prompting Crow to mention the rumors he's heard of how the Ghost forces people into Duels. Trudge tells them about the tournament's new rules, which means they'll be using " Speed World 2 " instead of the standard " Speed World ". Trudge wants Yusei, Jack, and Crow to help in the capture of the Ghost but Crow refuses and rushes Mina and Trudge out and bolts the door shut behind them, saying the three of them have much to do with getting ready for the tournament.
 While leaving, Mina and Trudge continue to discuss the Ghost matter in their car. That night Trudge orders a group of Duel Chasers to spread out over the bridge in search of the Ghost.
 
 Trudge's encounter with Ghost 
 Trudge rides his Duel Runner, along a highway, remembering his first Turbo Duel with Yusei. The Ghost shows up on the monitor of Trudge's Duel Runner. Trudge notices his "Speed World 2" has been activated by the Ghost and he engages in the Turbo Duel with the Ghost. The barriers along the road light up, saying it is now a Duel Lane.
 Trudge goes first and Summons " Samurai Sword Baron " and ends his turn.
 The Ghost Summons " Wise Core " and  Sets  two cards, ending his turn. Trudge questions this Duelist, as he played a monster with 0 DEF.
 Trudge Summons " Jutte Fighter " and tunes it with "Samurai Sword Baron" to  Synchro Summon  " Goyo Guardian ". Using "Goyo Guardian", he  attacks  "Wise Core", but Ghost stops the attack with " Negate Attack ". Trudge activates " Speed Spell - Count Up ",  sending  the " Gonogo " in his hand to the  Graveyard  to up his  Speed Counters  to four. He removes four of them from "Speed World 2" to inflict 1600 damage to Ghost as Trudge has two " Speed Spells " in his hand. Trudge slows down and his Duel Runner falls behind Ghost's. Trudge also reveals that "Speed World 2" no longer reduces Speed Counters due to damage.
 Ghost activates " Spark Breaker " destroying "Wise Core" and  Special Summoning  " Machine Emperor Wisel ∞ " (which is later revealed to be made of 5 separate monsters). The effect of "Machine Emperor Wisel ∞" absorbs "Goyo Guardian" and gain  ATK  equal to the ATK of "Goyo Guardian", raising its  ATK  to 5300. "Machine Emperor Wisel ∞" then attacks Trudge directly.
 Back at Yusei's basement, the screen on his computer goes fuzzy. Back on the highroad, there's a explosion, where Trudge was dueling. Crow later pases by and hears Security sirens. He looks over and sees Trudge wrapped in bandages being put into an ambulance.
 Yusei and Jack rush into the  hospital , where Crow and Mina are already waiting. Trudge is wheeled past them on a stretcher. He warns Yusei not to Synchro Summon against Ghost, before being taken into a operation chamber.
 
 Yusei's encounter with Ghost 
 Back at their basement, Crow slams his fists off the wall in annoyance with what the Ghost did to Trudge. Yusei tells him to stop whining and chucks him his helmet. The three of them ready their Duel Runners and take off in search of the Ghost. They split up at a highway.
 At 3:10 a.m., Yusei comes into contact with the Ghost. He alerts the other two and activates "Speed World 2". The road become a Duel Lane and other traffic pulls out of the way. Security notes the Duel and grants authorization. They set up the circuit, by raising the roadways and adding side ramps.
 The Ghost goes first and Summons "Wise Core". He  Sets  one card in his  Spell & Trap Card Zone  and ends his turn.
 Yusei Summons " Max Warrior " and uses it to attack "Wise Core". "Max Warrior's"  ATK  raises to 2200, due to its effect. Ghost activates " Labyrinth of Kline ", reducing the  Battle Damage  to 0 and preventing "Wise Core's" destruction. "Max Warrior's" ATK drops to 800. Yusei  Special Summons  " Turbo Booster ", using its effect and  Releases  it to destroy "Wise Core". Ghost laughs and uses "Wise Core's" effect, Special Summoning "Machine Emperor Wisel ∞", " Wisel Top ", " Wisel Attack ", " Wisel Guard " and " Wisel Carrier ". Using the effect of "Wisel Infinity", Ghost combines the 5 components.

He then tunes "Samurai Sword Baron" with "Jutte Fighter" in order to  Synchro Summon  " Goyo Guardian " ( 6/2800/2000) in Attack Position. "Goyo Guardian" attacks "Wise Core", but Ghost activates his face-down " Negate Attack " to negate the attack and end the  Battle Phase . 
 Trudge activates " Speed Spell - Count Up " to send " Gonogo " from his hand to the Graveyard and increase his  Speed Counters  by two (Trudge's SPC" 2 → 4). Trudge then activates the effect of "Speed World 2" to remove four Speed Counters (Trudge's SPC: 4 → 0) and inflict 800 damage to Ghost for every Speed Spell in his hand.

The ATK of "Machine Emperor Wisel ∞" becomes equal to the ATK of the other monsters that Ghost Special Summoned ("Machine Emperor Wisel ∞": 0 → 2500/0). 
 Ghost then activates the effect of "Machine Emperor Wisel ∞", equipping itself with "Goyo Guardian" and increasing its ATK by the ATK of "Goyo Guardian" ("Machine Emperor Wisel ∞": 2500 → 5300/0). "Machine Emperor Wisel ∞" attacks  directly  (Trudge 4000 → 0).
 
 Yusei Fudo vs. Ghost

 Yusei  draws. During the Standby Phase, the effect of " Speed World 2 " activates (Ghost's SPC: 0 → 1; Yusei's SPC: 0 → 1). Yusei Normal Summons " Max Warrior " ( 4/1800/800) in Attack Position. "Max Warrior" attacks "Wise Core". The first effect of "Max Warrior" activates, increasing its ATK by 400 ("Max Warrior": 1800 → 2200/800). Ghost activates his face-down " Labyrinth of Kline " to reduce the  Battle Damage  he takes to 0 and prevent "Wise Core" from being  destroyed  as well as swap the original ATK and DEF of "Max Warrior" until the next turn's End Phase ("Max Warrior": 2200 → 1200/800 → 1800). At the end of the Damage Step, the effect of "Max Warrior" expires ("Max Warrior": 1200 → 800/1800). 
 Yusei then Special Summons " Turbo Booster " ( 1/0/0) from his hand in Attack Position via its own effect. Yusei then Tributes "Turbo Booster" to  destroy  "Wise Core". This activates the effect of "Wise Core", which would destroy all of Ghost's monsters and then allowing Ghost to Special Summon "Machine Emperor Wisel ∞" ( 1/0/0) in Attack Position, " Wisel Top " ( 1/500/0) in Attack Position, " Wisel Attack " ( 1/1200/0) in Attack Position, and " Wisel Carrier " ( 1/800/600) all Attack Position, as well as " Wisel Guard " ( 1/0/1200) in Defense Position. Due to the effect of "Machine Emperor Wisel ∞", its ATK becomes equal to the combined ATK of all other Wisel monsters that Ghost controls ("Machine Emperor Wisel ∞": 0 → 2500/0).
 Duel continues in the next episode . 
 
 Tenth anniversary tribute 
 This episode begins with an approximately 15 second tribute to the original  Yu-Gi-Oh! series  in honor of the series' tenth anniversary. It starts with  Yami Yugi  drawing " Dark Magician " then goes on to show his most famous monsters (from left: bottom row: " Curse of Dragon ", " Kuriboh ", and " Celtic Guardian " middle row: " Alpha ", " Valkyrion ", and " Gamma " top row: " Magician of Black Chaos ", " Black Luster Soldier ", " Gaia The Fierce Knight ", and " Beta ") the screen then shifts to " Dark Magician Girl " alone, followed by " Dark Magician " and pictures of  Jaden ,  Yugi , and  Yusei  above the 10th anniversary logo on a background showcasing their Decks.
 
 Differences in adaptions 
 From this episode onwards, the  ATK  and  DEF  meters include the  Level  of the monster, similar to the Japanese version. 
 Mistakes 
 In the English version, When  Trudge  activated " Speed World 2 " to inflict damage on  Ghost , it showed the  ATK  meter instead of the  Life Points  meter. 
 In the English version, when Trudge explains the effect of " Speed Spell - Count Up ", " Labyrinth of Kline " can be seen. Also, in the Japanese version, " Battle Return " can be seen even though it didn't appear until  episode 66 . The card face-down was supposed to be " Spark Breaker ". 
 In the English and Japanese versions, when  Ghost  activates the effect of his " Wise Core ", you can see that the attribute of " Machine Emperor Wisel ∞ " is EARTH. It is supposed to be DARK.
