Cards that are  not  legal  in a given  region  may not be used in tournaments in that region. If there is any region a card is not legal in, it may not be used in  World Championship  events.
 Generally, a card becomes legal in a region when it has been officially released in a product in that region. For example,  Shonen Jump  promotional cards  become tournament-legal in  North America  upon their release, but they are not tournament-legal in  South America ,  Europe ,  Australia , or  Africa  until they have been formally released in a product in those regions, since  Shonen Jump  is distributed exclusively in North America.
 This term is distinct from  illegal , used for cards which have  limitation text  and will never be legal anywhere, and  Forbidden , used for cards that are legal for tournament use but are currently restricted to zero copies in the  Main ,  Side , and  Extra  Decks for all  Advanced Format  events.
 Currently, cards that are not legal do not have an indication of that status on their pages on this wiki. This page lists some cards that are not legal in various regions, but the information here may be incomplete, out of date, or otherwise incorrect.

 Not legal outside of Asia 
 Main article:  OCG exclusive

 Not legal in Asia 
 Main article:  TCG exclusive 
 Any cards that are  TCG exclusive  have not been released in the  OCG , and so are not legal in regions that the  OCG  covers, namely Asia.
 
 Not legal in South America, Europe, Australia, and Africa 
 The following cards have been released in both the  OCG  and  TCG  (making them legal in Asia), but their only  TCG  release has been through a region-restricted method in North America. They are thus not legal in South America, Europe, Australia, and Africa, despite all these regions also following the  TCG . They may eventually become legal once re-released in the  TCG  through a non-region-restricted method.
