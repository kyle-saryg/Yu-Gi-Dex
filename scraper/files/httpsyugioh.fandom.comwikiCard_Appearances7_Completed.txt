 In  episode 32 ,  Bandit Keith  uses this card during his Duel against  Joey Wheeler . When " Red-Eyes Black Metal Dragon " attacks " Slot Machine ", Keith activates this card to equip this card onto "Slot Machine" and chooses to increase the DEF of "Slot Machine" by 700. As a result of this, the attack fails. On Keith's turn, he  cheats  by taking another copy of this card out of his wristband and make it look like he drew it. Keith then activates the second copy, equipping it to "Slot Machine" and choosing to increase its ATK by 700. On Keith's next turn, he takes the third copy of this card out of his wristband and activates it, equipping it to "Slot Machine" and choosing to increase its ATK by 700.
