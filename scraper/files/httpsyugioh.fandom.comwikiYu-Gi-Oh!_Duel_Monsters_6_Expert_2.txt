 Characters 
 This is a listing of characters in the video game  Yu-Gi-Oh! Duel Monsters 6 Expert 2 .
 
 Start of game Duelists 
 Tea Gardner : She runs a Deck filled with female cards such as  Fire Princess ,  Marie the Fallen One ,  Sonic Maid , and  Lady Assailant of Flames . She'll also pull out Fusion Monsters like  Mystical Sand  and  Warrior of Tradition  from time to time. 
 Joey Wheeler : Joey runs a lot of luck-based cards like  Skull Dice ,  Graceful Dice , and  Time Wizard  alongside some strong Warrior-Type monsters with negative effects like  Goblin Attack Force ,  Zombyra the Dark , and  Gearfried the Iron Knight . 
 Yugi Muto : Yugi mainly runs Magnet Warriors and  Spellcasters . He is one of the hardest opponents in the game. While you usually duel Yami, on some occasions you will duel Yugi instead. 
 Seto Kaiba : Seto Kaiba is also a hard duelist. He tries to acquire tributes for his  Blue-Eyes White Dragon  and if given the opportunity he will use the effect of  Cyber-Stein  to summon his  Blue-Eyes Ultimate Dragon . He also sometimes couples BEWD with  Megamorph  for an  OTK . 
 Mai Valentine : Mai runs a general  Winged Beast - Type  /  Wind - Attribute  Deck with  Harpies  as her centerpiece. Be careful if you run  Cyber Harpie  because she can use your own Harpie to activate  Elegant Egotist  to summon  Harpie Lady Sisters . 
 Mako Tsunami : Mako Tsunami runs Water monsters and the  Field Spell Card   Umi . He can often pull off an annoying combo of  Umi  and  Tornado Wall  that prevents him from taking any  Battle Damage . 
 Espa Roba : Espa Roba uses a loose "psychic"-themed Deck with cards that can allow him to "see" your Deck such as  Big Eye  and  Light of Intervention . His most powerful monster is  Jinzo . 
 Weevil Underwood : Weevil uses  Insects , and his goal is usually to bring out his  Insect Queen . He also uses many  Flip Effect  monsters such as  Needle Worm ,  Parasite Paracide , and  Man-Eater Bug 
 Rex Raptor : Rex Raptor uses  Dinosaurs  such as  Two-Headed King Rex , but he uses the  Blue-Eyes White Dragon  after you've beaten him many times. 
 Solomon Muto : Solomon doesn’t quite have a theme. However, he does have an Exodia set in his Deck. 
 Ryou Bakura : He mostly uses the  Destiny Board  cards and  Gravekeeper's Servant , as well as Fiend-Type monsters (though he never summons his signature card,  Dark Necrofear ). While usually, you duel the spirit of the Millennium Ring, sometimes you will duel Bakura instead. 
 Ishizu Ishtar : Her Deck is filled with rather powerful  Light - Attribute  /  Fairy - Type  monsters such as  Hysteric Fairy ,  Dunames Dark Witch , and  The Forgiving Maiden . Some of her other cards include  Luminous Spark ,  Soul of Purity and Light , and  St. Joan . 
 Unlockable Duelists 
 Mokuba Kaiba : Mokuba can be unlocked by having a record of losing at least 10 duels. He's the easiest duelist in the game. His strongest card is  Kanan the Swordmistress  and the only trap card he uses is  Magic Jammer . When you challenge Mokuba while Kaiba is in the same area, Kaiba will intercept and you will duel him instead and vice versa. Mokuba does not play monsters in Defense Positon. Mokuba also has some pieces of Exodia, but he usually summons them, making the whole point of including Exodia peices in his Deck pointless. In some cases yet he has a copy of " Cyber-Stein " in his Deck and uses it to summon his " Blue-Eyes Ultimate Dragon " and then power it up with " Megamorph ". 
 Marik Ishtar :  Dark  Monsters leveled with  Gravity Bind . When you challenge Marik while Bakura is in the same area, Bakura will intercept and you will duel him instead and vice versa. While you normally duel the regular Marik, sometimes he will change into Yami Marik and return to normal once defeated. 
 Bandit Keith : Gamble Cards and  Machines . 
 Duke Devlin : Dice Cards. 
 Maximillion Pegasus : Pegasus runs a Deck filled with  Toons . 
 Rare Hunters : If you lose to them, they will steal your cards. In the early game they are encountered randomly when you talk to passengers, but later you can unlock them as regular opponents. However, they will occasionally appear among passers-by even afterwards.
 Rare Hunter :  Exodia 
 Strings : Slime 
 Lumis  and  Umbra : Masks 
 Arkana :  Dark Magician 
 Odion :  Trap Cards 
 Shadi : He will copy the Deck of one of the other opponents in the game (for example Yugi, Kaiba or Marik). 
         Map     
 Plot 
 The main focus of the game is participating in tournaments and collecting cards, but a small plot section occurs where the player battles with the  Ghouls .
 After defeating the five Ghouls, who randomly appear,  Téa  controlled by  Marik  leads the player to the Ghoul's Pyramid. Here they must win five duels in a row, proceeding to a new chamber after winning each. The first is against Téa controlled by Marik, then  Joey  controlled, the next two are random Ghouls and the last is Marik.
 After clearing this section of the game, the Ghouls no longer randomly appear and may be faced like normal opponents and in events.
 
         Deck Edit     
 Events/Challenges 
 Challenge Cup  and  KaibaCorp Cup : This event usually comes every month. This challenge is a three game tournament in which all players face each other to make their way to the finals. Kaiba will always be one of the player's opponent's in the KaibaCorp Cup. 
 Weekend Tournaments : The player faces a random opponent in a  Match . 
 Limitation Tournaments : Only accessed by finishing everything else in the game, there are ten rounds. The player participates in a duel, in which their Deck is restricted to a only include certain types of cards or must exclude certain types of cards. Clearing this allows players to turn off the card  limitations , allowing three copies of every card in their Deck. 
 Target Week : Once a week, one of the Battle City officials will give the player two random opponents. If they manage to find and defeat the opponents, they are awarded 200 points. 
         Duel Field     
 Obtaining cards 
 At the start of the game, the payer is given a choice of three Decks. After that cards can be obtained through packs opened in the game or the password menu.
 In the password menu, the player can get cards by entering the eight digit Card Number found in the bottom corner of real cards.
 All Packs in the game contain five random cards, from a set. Unlike its counterpart ( Yu-Gi-Oh! Worldwide Edition: Stairway to the Destined Duel ) the booster packs in the game are the same as  OCG  booster packs, although there some game exclusive packs like  Ultimate Random Pack . 
 After defeating an opponent you meet on the map screen you are awarded a Booster Pack. Special Packs are given for winning tournaments or defeating Ghouls. Every week the player is given five random cards with the magazine  Duelist Weekly .

 Miscellaneous information 
 After dueling an opponent 99 times, the counter resets to 00 and then back to 01. No record is kept on the total amount of duels with that opponent.
 In the Deck & Trunk main menu, there is a bar for achievements such as beating certain Cups, or getting a certain number of cards unlocked. There is no award for unlocking everything on this golden bar.
 There is a subroutine that allows Yami Yugi to cheat and start specifically with the following hand :  Valkyrion the Magna Warrior ,  Alpha The Magnet Warrior ,  Beta The Magnet Warrior ,  Gamma The Magnet Warrior , and  Premature Burial . This subroutine also puts  Raigeki  as the top card of his deck. Similarly, Mai Valentine can start with  Elegant Egotist ,  Cyber Harpie Lady ,  Rising Air Current , a second  Elegant Egotist , and  Cyber Shield , with  Premature Burial  on top of her Deck, Mokuba Kaiba can start with  Heavy Storm ,  Dark Hole ,  Cyber-Stein , and  Megamorph , and his brother Seto Kaiba with the same hand plus  Harpie's Feather Duster  and  Raigeki .

 Trivia 
 Yami Marik 's appearance on the box cover of this video game is taken from  Yu-Gi-Oh! Duelist  Duel 163: " The Rise of Ra! " , specifically from the panel where he laughs at  Mai Kujaku , asking how she plans on using " The Winged Dragon of Ra ", after he prompts her to continue her turn.
 Yami Yugi 's appearance here is taken from the title page for  Yu-Gi-Oh! Duelist  Duel 148: " One-Turn Kill " , although he is shown without his jacket, the cards in his left hand, and his  Duel Disk .
