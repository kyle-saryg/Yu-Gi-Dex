 Game show champion  Ryuichi Fuwa , the second of  Seto Kaiba 's Game Masters moves to the gang's high school. Although he seems friendly, Ryuichi's tactics for arousing Dark Yugi soon turn dangerous.
 
 Summary 
 Ryuichi , who is the unbeaten champion of a TV game show and considers himself to be the luckiest man in the world, comes to  Domino High School  under the command of  Seto Kaiba  to try to make the  other Yugi  appear. Ryuichi decides that he either has to cause  Yugi  severe pain or else peel off his skin in order to bring out the other Yugi. However, when Jonouchi takes Yugi's place in the ninth game show that Ryuichi wins with ease, it is then that Dark Yugi emerges to face Ryuichi. 
 Later, the other Yugi challenges Fuwa to a game of electrical pairs in which a player must give all the pairs he has to the opposing player when he gets a Joker, and if he fails to get a pair he will receive an electric shock (the same game that Ryuichi and Jonouchi played). Ryuichi's luck gives him the edge, while Dark Yugi continues to choose the same pairs of cards each time. When the power cuts out, unbeknownst to Ryuichi, the order of the cards is scrambled, but instead of trusting his luck, Ryuichi picks the cards that he thought were in the same place, only to get the Joker and lose. Afterwards, Ryuichi's luck abandons him during his tenth game show and he loses despite only needing to get a 3 or higher to win.
