 Marco  is a character in  Yu-Gi-Oh! 5D's , whose family was cheated out of their possessions by  Don Piero .
 
 Biography 
 Marco once lived in  Satellite , where he and his family were deprived of a lot of life's luxuries. After the  Dark Signers  were defeated and Satellite was reconnected with  New Domino City , the family moved to New Domino and began a normal life.
 Using false documents, Piero conned Marco's family into owing him money. As they were unable to pay in time, he repossessed their belongings. Marco tried begging Piero's thugs into not taking the money he needed to buy medicine for his mother. Piero took his cards, but unable to find a rare one, he threw them all over the room.  
 In order to support his family, Marco worked at a delivery service.
 He took his Deck to the  Duel Statue , where he left his cards and prayed for the Duel Goddess to use them to defeat Piero. Marco's brother  Mikey  tried talking him out of it, as he would be unable to Duel himself if he went through with this. Believing that to be the case either way, Marco still left the cards.
 Jack Atlas , who overheard Marco at the statue, took cards from the Deck and used them in his Duel against Piero.  Carly Carmine  took Marco to see the Duel. Jack wagered his " Red Dragon Archfiend " card and  Duel Runner ;  Phoenix Whirlwind  to win Piero's false documents. After winning, Jack tore up the documents, erasing all Marco's family's debts. Jack also tells him, that he would be waiting for the day the two of them can face each other in a  Turbo Duel .
 
 Deck 
 Marco uses a  Fairy  Deck , which was seen when he set it at the  Duel Statue . Some of the cards were used by  Jack Atlas  when the latter Dueled  Don Piero .
