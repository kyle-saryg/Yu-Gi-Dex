Capsule Monsters bit 
 "This contradicts the events of the manga and anime as it would mean that Shadi was killed Millennia before the start of the series."
 How does that contradict the events?  Isn't it possible that Shadi was a ghost then too?  He also tested Peguses and Yugi in similar ways even when a ghost.-- 76.27.8.201  ( talk ) 04:23, September 6, 2010 (UTC)
 
 
 If the objection is to the timeline, even the shortest time between Atem's death and Yugi's assembling of the puzzle is 3,000 years. In the English language version of Capsule Monsters, Anzu specifically cites the date of Alexander's birth. That would give about 700 years between the Pharaoh's death and Alexander's conquests.
 Plus, the article says earlier that Shadi was a ghost before the events of the main manga and second-series anime. If he were alive at the time of Atem's rule, that would have meant he'd been a ghost for about 700 years when he encountered Alexander. As for the whole testing in the first place, Shadi was just doing his job of stewardship over the Items.  —This unsigned comment was made by  97.113.236.199  ( talk  •  contribs ) 11:19, August 19, 2011 
 What's the pronunciation of Shadi's name? Shay-dee, long vowels, or Sha-di, short vowels? It confuses me so much when i talk to my friends about YuGiOh, seeing as Shadi's one of my favorite charcters.
 
 The second one, Sha-Di

 Shadi's Death 
 The article previously said that Shadi was killed by Thief King Bakura in the ancient past, but this is based entirely on a dub mistranslation. In episode 201, dub Shadi says he is a "centuries-old spirit" killed by "a tomb robber named Bakura", but in the original Japanese version, he does not say he is centuries-old, and only says he was killed by "Bakura", never specifying that it was Thief King Bakura, and in fact earlier in the Japanese version of episode 96, Bakura has  these   thoughts.  He knows that  "five years ago, Shadi was already...",  and it's very clear that "dead" is the end of that sentence.  Just like in the manga, it was Dark Bakura who killed Shadi a few years ago.

 Why is Shadi's Toei picture here? Shouldn't Toei!Shadi have a separate page since it's a separate series?  Lalalei2001  ( talk  •  contribs ) 00:38, January 17, 2017 (UTC)
