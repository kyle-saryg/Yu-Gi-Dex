      Duke girls A, B and C     
 The  Duke girls  are a trio of cheerleaders, who supported  Duke Devlin  in the  Yu-Gi-Oh!  anime .
 While not specifically named in the English dub, they are called  Otogi girls  ( 御 伽 ガールズ  Otogi gāruzu ) in the Japanese anime. (Ryuji Otogi being Duke's name in the Japanese version.) In the episode credits, they are simply called  girls  (ガールズ  gāruzu ) and are voiced by  Noriko Namiki ,  Rumi Shishido  and  Yoshiko Iseki  in the Japanese version, [1]  and by  Megan Hollingshead , Kayzie Rogers and  Tara Sands  in the English dub. [ citation needed ]  They are based on three girls from the manga, who had a similar role, but did not dress as cheerleaders for  Otogi 's games. [2]  In character lineart, the individual members are labelled "A", "B" and "C". [3] 
 
 History 
       Joey  imagining the girls as "Joey girls" ("Jonouchi girls" in the Japanese version)     
 The three girls were among a group of female students at  Domino High School , who were impressed by Duke Devlin's dice tricks.  Joey Wheeler  became jealous and hoped to beat Duke in a game to win the girls' attention. After losing a  dice in cup  game, he challenged Duke to a game of  Duel Monsters . Duke added the conditions that they play using cards from newly opened  Booster Packs  and if he won, Joey would do as he said for a week. Joey accepted and said that if he won, the girls would have to cheer for him, which the girls were horrified by. (In the English dub, Joey said that Duke would have to close the  Black Crown  if he won.) [1] 
 Three of the girls stayed on and dressed as cheerleaders, wearing sashes with "Otogi" wrote on them. (The text is erased in the English dub.) When Joey was well ahead of Duke in the Duel,  Yugi Muto  tried warning him not to get overconfident, but Joey ignored him, as he fantasized the girls, cheering for him as "Joey girls", with sashes saying "Jonouchi". (The text is erased in the English dub. "Katsuya Jonouchi" is Joey's name in the Japanese version.) Joey ultimately lost the Duel and per the wager had to act as Duke's slave. One of the Duke girls provided him with a dog costume, which Duke wanted him to wear. [1] 
 When  Yami Yugi  faced Duke in  Dungeon Dice Monsters  for Joey's freedom, the Duke girls continued to cheer for Duke. With help from Joey, they used their bodies to spell out Otogi's name in katakana, オトギ. They attacked Joey whenever he bad-mouthed Duke. [4]
