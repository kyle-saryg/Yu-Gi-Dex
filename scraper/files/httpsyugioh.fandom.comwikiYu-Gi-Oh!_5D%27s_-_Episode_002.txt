 Summary 
       Jack defeats Yusei.     
 A flashback, two years prior to 5D's current events shows Yusei dueling Jack. Jack mocks Yusei for thinking that he can defeat the King. Yusei reacts by recklessly attacking Jack's " Mad Archfiend " with " Junk Warrior ", only to fall into Jack's trap, " Shadow Spell ". Jack then attacks "Junk Warrior", defeating Yusei in the process. Yusei falls to the floor and punches it out of anger.  Blitz ,  Tank ,  Nervin  and  Rally  are shocked that he lost. Jack then approaches Yusei and tells him that he can't win with  monsters  alone.
 
       Jack looking at " Stardust Dragon ".     
 Back to the normal timeline, Jack is shown observing  Satellite  through the window in  his penthouse , he then looks at the " Stardust Dragon " card in his hand.  Rex Goodwin  arrives and questions Jack on why he's thinking about the past to which Jack launches the card into his deck, with it perfectly wedging in the center, surprising Goodwin. Jack explains the humilation he felt having lived in such a place and suggests it should be wiped off of the face of the earth. But Goodwin states that without Satellite,  New Domino City  wouldn't prosper as the civilians of Satellite recycle the trash sent from New Domino. He then states that he believes that Jack being from Satellite was a test from God.
 
       Lenny grabs Blitz.     
 Meanwhile, back in Satellite in an abandoned and destroyed subway,  Rally  times Yusei on his  Duel Runner . Rally excitedly screams that Yusei has beat his best time and that breaking through the pipeline should be extremely easy for him. Yusei asks him to test him again before speeding down the tunnel again. At the same time, Blitz, Tank and Nervin have just finished working in a recycling plant are are exiting, carrying several boxes full of trash. Seeing this,  Lenny  sticks his leg out, tripping Tank over in the process. Seeing this, Blitz and Nervin drop their boxes to assist Tank as he was injured in the process. Lenny jokes about how it was an accident as his legs are so long and mocks the three from being from Satellite, to which his goons  Lug  and  Larry  laugh at. Blitz sarcastically replies about how Lenny has a  Criminal mark  which angers him and as a response he grabs Blitz by his shirt collar and punches him. The three are then shown back at  Yusei's hideout  bruised and being tended to by Rally. Blitz is angered by the fact that even though he's been banished to Satellite, he still mocks Satellite-borns for being such.
 
         The "Special Pursuit Deck".     
 He then questions Yusei about  the officer  he dueled and that any self respecting Duelist ought to uphold the outcome of a match, to which Yusei said "I wouldn't call him a Duelist! But for a dog of the establishment, it seems he can accept his losses." Trudge is then shown receiving his " Special Pursuit Deck " from a  Security chief  who informs Trudge that he should put his job before dueling and that he can use that deck to capture Yusei. Trudge thanks him and asks a Security clerk to inform him when Yusei's Duel Runner shows up again. While working on his Duel Runner, Yusei discusses his plan of sneaking into New Domino City to reclaim his "Stardust Dragon" and Duel Runner that Jack stole. His friends reminisce about the first time they saw a  Turbo Duel  and because of it, Yusei was inspired to build his own Duel Runner. They then remember the first time Yusei  Synchro Summoned  his "Stardust Dragon" and discuss whether or not Jack was plotting all of that time against the three of them. Yusei then states that his Duel Runner has past all expectations and ran through the escape simulation perfectly.
 
         Lenny vs. Yusei.     
 Just then, Lenny, Larry and Lug arrive and insult the group, stating that people from Satellite shouldn't own such luxuries. Lenny then suggests that Yusei give him the Duel Runner if he doesn't want his friends to be beaten up again. Yusei then proposes a duel to which Lenny agrees to. Yusei takes his Turbo Deck out of his Deck holder and swaps it with his Ground Deck from a deck box on his belt. He then detaches his  Duel Disk  from his hybrid Duel Runner which Lenny compliments him on. His friends protest, but Yusei ignores them. The group then walk further down the subway and begin their duel. Lenny begins his turn by  Normal Summoning  " Chainsaw Insect " in  Attack Position . Yusei's friends are shocked at how powerful it is for a  Level 4 monster . Lenny then continues by activating " Retribution of the Ant Lion ", explaining how if their monsters are destroyed, they'll take 800 damage. Yusei's friends wonder on Lenny's strategy which he replies that he uses a "Power Insect Deck". Yusei begins his turn by Normal Summoning " Shield Warrior " in  Defense Position  and setting 1 card. Lenny mocks Yusei for his defensive tactics then Normal Summons " Pinch Hopper " and activating " Insect Costume ", adding " Doom Dozer " from his deck to his hand, destroying "Pinch Hopper" in the process. This triggers "Retribution of the Ant Lion", inflicting 800 damage to Lenny. This shocks him as he doesn't know what inflicted the damage to him. Blitz replies that it was due to the effect of his own card. Lenny continues on by using the effect of "Pinch Hopper" to  Special Summon  " Metal Armored Bug " from his hand. Nervin comments that the monster is huge. Lenny states that it isn't all he has in store for Yusei. He  removes from play  " Insect Knight " and "Pinch Hopper" from his  Graveyard  to Special Summon "Doom Dozer" from his hand.
 
         " Domino Effect " causes Lenny's defeat.     
 He begins his assault by attacking "Shield Warrior" with "Chainsaw Insect", but Yusei activates his set " Scrap-Iron Scarecrow " to negate the attack, shocking Lenny. It then sets itself back on Yusei's field. Lenny continues by destroying "Shield Warrior" with "Metal Armored Bug" with "Retribution of the Ant Lion" inflicting 800 damage. He finally assaults Yusei directly with "Doom Dozer", dropping his  LP  to 400. He then mocks Yusei as he can't stand up to his "Power Insect Deck". Yusei calmly begins his turn, Normal Summoning " Speed Warrior " in Attack Position. He then activates " Double Summon ", additionally Normal Summoning " Junk Synchron ", also in Attack Position. Yusei's friends cheer as they know what Yusei is planning. Yusei then  tunes  "Junk Synchron" with "Speed Warrior" to Synchro Summon " Junk Warrior ". This shocks Lenny as someone from Satellite owns a Synchro Monster, but his friends cheer him on regardless. Yusei then equips "Junk Warrior" with " Fighting Spirit ", increasing its  ATK  by 300 per monster on Lenny's field; therefore it goes up to 3200 ATK. Yusei then activates " Domino Effect " and attacks "Chainsaw Insect". He then chains the effect of "Domino Effect", sending his set "Scrap-Iron Scarecrow" and "Fighting Spirit" to the Graveyard to cause "Chainsaw Insect" to topple over into "Doom Dozer" which then falls onto "Metal Armored Bug", destroying all of Lenny's monsters in the process. This chains the ability of "Retribution of the Ant Lion", decreasing Lenny's LP to 0. Yusei then walks over to Lenny, and tells him about the lesson that Jack taught him how duels can only be won by utilizing all types of cards with one another. Lenny compliments Yusei's dueling abilities and tells him that the next time they duel, he won't be so lucky.
 
         Jack stares at the moon.     
 Jack is then shown racing around a duel track. He suddenly stops and looks up at the sky. Rex walks over and wonders what Jack is up to. Jack tells him that the moon is clear, just like the night when he escaped from Satellite to New Domino City. Yusei is also shown observing the moon through a crevasse in the road above.

 Differences in adaptations 
 In the Japanese version, the episode begins with a flashback of Yusei and Jack dueling. In the English version the episode begins with a view of the Satellite. 
 In the English version Uryu does not have a name but on some T.V. listings they say his name his Lenny and his friends are named Lug and Larry. 
 In the English version, The scene with Rally timing how fast Yusei can go on the Duel Runner is put between the conversation that Jack and Rex Goodwin are having. 
 In the Japanese version, the word "CESIO" and Mode appears on Rally's stopwatch. In the English version, they are both erased. Cesio is likely an imitation of  Casio  used in the anime. 
 In the Japanese version, after Uryu trips Nerve, Taka and Blitz ( Blitz ,  Tank  and  Nervin ), he ridicules them for being from Satellite. In the English version, he corrects Tank saying he was tripped and didn't fall and since he marked his shoes, Uryu suggests that he buy him new ones. 
 In the Japanese version, Taka's (Tank's) flashback of Yusei hacking into the city's system shows his friends watching a Riding Duel (Turbo Duel) and Jack riding Yusei's stolen D-Wheel (Duel Runner) to the pipe line that leads to Neo Domino City (New Domino City). This was removed in the English version.
 A very close up scene of Jack is also cut from the dub. 
 In the original Yusei decided to accept Uryu's challenge, he says he scoffed at their dreams. In the dub Yusei says bullys never learn unless you stand up to them. 
 In the Japanese version, Yusei was not afraid of insects. 
 When "Doom Dozer" attacked Yusei, his friends scream his name. In the English version after that an edited version of the stairway is shown. 
 In the original after Yusei takes heavy damage, Uryu cockily says how Yusei will come back from that. In the dub he asked if Yusei was ever going to fight back. 
 Trivia 
 On the Japanese DVD Version of this episodes, many shots of a few characters have been redrawn, such as Yusei holding up the Junk Synchron card. 
 For some reason, the dub uses the DVD Version for the flashback at the beginning of the episode, but uses the TV Version for the rest of the episode. 
 In the original during his duel with Yusei, before he summons "Doom Dozer" Lenny says the catchphrase of  Yuya Sakaki  "The Real Fun Is Just Getting Started" a.k.a in Japanese as "Ōtonōshimi Wā Korekara Dā".

 Mistakes 
 Dub mistakes 
 The dub places the " Doom Dozer " card off-kilter on  Lennys   Duel Disk . 
 At one point, the dub draws the black oval in the center of  Yusei 's cards off-center. 
 When " Junk Warrior " has its ATK increased to 3200, for a split second the ATK meter appears as its original design from the Japanese version. 
 'Doom Dozer' incorrectly placed.     1/2 
 All versions mistake 
 After  Lenny  Summons " Pinch Hopper ", the card he  discarded  was " Metal Armored Bug ", but it was supposed to be " Insect Knight ". This was fixed on the Japanese DVD. 
 When  Yusei  is attacked by " Doom Dozer ", his  LP  go from 3000 to 400, but should have started at 3200. "Doom Dozer's" TCG/OCG effect that sends the top card of its opponent's Deck to their Graveyard does not apply.

 Notes 
 
 ↑   The difference in ATK between the weakened "Junk Warrior" and "Mad Archfiend" was 200, so unless there was a card effect on the field that could deplete Yusei's remaining 100 LP, he shouldn't have lost. 
 
 ↑   This card is shown as " Metal Armored Bug " when  discarded . 
 
 ↑   The written Japanese anime lore of " Chainsaw Insect " is the same as its  OCG  counterpart, so the opponent should have  drawn  a card as "Chainsaw Insect"  battled . 
 
 ↑   The written Japanese anime lore of " Domino Effect " is the same as that of its  OCG  counterpart, meaning only  monsters  should have been able to have been  sent .
