 Joey  is the  Yu-Gi-Oh! The Duelists of the Roses  incarnation of  Joey Wheeler  and portrayal of  Christopher Urswick . He is a member of the Red Roses of Lancaster.
 If the player chooses to side with the White Roses, they face Joey at  Amiens  after defeating  Mako . After defeating him, the player can go to Paris to face  J. Shadi Morton 
 
 Deck 
 His deck mostly focusing on the random monsters his original incarnation used for both his decks, such as  Warriors ,  Dragons ,  Beast-Warriors .
 He takes a "wait and see" approach to dueling, unlike Anime Joey, tending to move his deck master to one corner of the board while sending out his monsters to win the duel for him. Players are advised to move into the TOON terrain on the board to lessen the chances of losing major points.
