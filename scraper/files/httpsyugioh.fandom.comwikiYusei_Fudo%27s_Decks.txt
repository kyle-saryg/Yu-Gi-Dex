Yusei  plays a  " Warrior " and  Machine  Deck  featuring the " Synchron " monsters.
 Those who know him very well (such as  Jack ,  Kalin , and  Crow ) say that he is starting to get predictable because he has been using the same basic strategies for a long time. Despite this, Yusei is still known for his genius Dueling style, being able to quickly comprehend his opponent's tactics and quickly formulate an effective counter strategy.
 His Decks are generally low powered, with most of the initial cards obtained from  Satellite  after residents of  New Domino City  threw them out prior to the series. The Deck focuses on  swarming  the field with low Level monsters, letting him easily perform  Synchro Summons  to gain an advantage.
 He has only lost 1 Duel (against  Jack Atlas  in a flashback), with a few Duels having no result and all the other Duels won. In the manga, he also has a similar record, with only 1 defeat and all the rest won.

 Yusei uses a  Defensive / Warrior  Deck , largely focused around  Synchro Summoning  his " Junk Warrior ", and later his " Stardust Dragon ". Due to the low stats of the majority of his  monsters , Yusei uses a large amount of  Speed Spells  and  Trap Cards  to enhance their strength such as " Speed Spell - Silver Contrails " and " Counterattack Beacon ". As well as this, he also uses a large quantity of monsters with defensive capabilities such as " Shield Wing " and " Massive Warrior ". Due to " Speed World " limiting his usage of Speed Spells, Yusei uses a large quantity of traps.

 Yusei continues to play a  Defensive/Warrior Deck , but with more of a heavy focus on  swarm  and  Synchro Summon  tactics. To counter the " Earthbound Immortals ", Yusei added a large amount of  spell  and  trap  cards to get around their immunity to being affected by such cards, primarily to reduce damage through cards such as " Baton of the Hero " and " Scrubbed Raid ". In addition to this, after acquiring " Majestic Star Dragon ", he utilized more  support  for his "Stardust Dragon".

 Yusei later uses an  Advantage / Graveyard Based  Turbo Deck  consisting largely of cards which gain abilities whilst in the Graveyard, for example " Damage Eater " and " A/D Changer ", or by  discarding  them from his hand such as " Effect Veiler " and " Stronghold Guardian ". In addition, he now uses a large array of  draw power  as his strategies take up a sizable amount of cards from his hand.
