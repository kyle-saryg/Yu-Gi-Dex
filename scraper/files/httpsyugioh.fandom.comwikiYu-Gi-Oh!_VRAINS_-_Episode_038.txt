 As the Tower of Hanoi gradually approaches its completion,  Varis  reflects on the battles that had been waged in  LINK VRAINS . And now, carrying on the wishes of  Dr. Kogami  with firm resolve, Varis makes his move...
 
 Summary 
 Varis looks over at his fallen comrades:  Dr. Genome ,  Baira ,  Faust  and  Specter . He vows not to let Specter's defeat be in vain. That said, Varis knows that his first mistake was not destroying the  Cyberse World  five years ago, and a  flashback to the first episode is shown , including the moment Varis knew  Playmaker  had the escaped Ignis. 
 The first  Knight of Hanoi  that  tried to take the Ignis from Playmaker, failed . Varis recalls that his team wasn't the only one searching for Playmaker, but they were able to  entice bystanders to do their bidding , such as one  Blue Angel , who Specter was able to give a  corrupt card  to before her  duel against Playmaker . After her defeat, Varis knew they were one step closer to luring out Playmaker. And indeed, Varis  found Playmaker after the latter's capture at the hands of   Akira Zaizen . Prior to his  Speed Duel against Playmaker , Varis outlined his reasons for capturing Playmaker's Ignis. During the duel, he demonstrated Storm Access, but  the duel ended in a draw . Varis decided to intensify the Data Storm and lure Playmaker to where they would  Master Duel . Playmaker overcame Varis' " Fire Prison " to  Link Summon  " Firewall Dragon " and  win the duel , but this happened only after Playmaker inferred that he was a victim of the  Lost Incident , something Varis had not known about Playmaker until then. 
 Faust, Baira and Dr. Genome would soon  join Varis on his mission  to track Playmaker down and seize his Ignis. Unfortunately, Dr. Genome  lost to   The Gore , Baira  lost to Blue Angel  and Faust  lost to Playmaker . Varis honors their brave efforts that ultimately bought time for Varis. Just then,  Dr. Kogami  appears to Varis, asking if he has uncovered Playmaker's identity yet. Varis appears not to tell the truth. Dr. Kogami laments that he should never have experimented with the creation of self-aware artificial intelligence. He says this over a  flashback to the manifestation of the Tower of Hanoi .  Varis sees the tower and believes Playmaker may very well be drawn to resist. Varis awaits Playmaker, accusing him of being on the wrong side of history, and looks forward to eliminating him for good.
