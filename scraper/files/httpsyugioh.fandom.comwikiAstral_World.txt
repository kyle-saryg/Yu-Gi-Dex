 Astral World  (アストラル 世 界   Asutoraru Sekai ) is the dimension where  Astral  was born and a location in  Yu-Gi-Oh! ZEXAL  series. It is regarded as a parallel world without  Chaos  and the counterpart of  Barian World . It is administered by their godhead  Eliphas  who had been created by the denizens of the  Astral World  as the ultimate symbol of their worldview of "Ranking-Up" at the time. 
 According to Astral, only individuals who have "Ranked Up" in a spiritual way can reach this world. [1]  Originally it strives to "Rank-Up" towards a higher plane of existence by destroying  Barian World , with which Astral was to achieve as its envoy. [2]  However, this has changed following the Duel between its godhead,  Eliphas , and  Yuma Tsukumo . [3]

 History 
           Kazuma Tsukumo  fell to Astral World.     
 When  Kazuma Tsukumo  fell from a cliff in a snowy mountain during one of his explorations with his  wife , he landed in Astral World, and obtained the  Emperor's Key . It is unknown if that was just his spirit as his body was severely damaged when he woke up, [4]  though Astral has stated that only those with "ranked-up souls" may enter Astral World, which may be obtained by an individual working towards their greatest dreams. [1] 
 Five years before the  WDC , Kazuma,  Dr. Faker  and  Byron Arclight  went on an exploration to find the door to parallel worlds. Dr. Faker betrayed his companions and used them as sacrifices to open the door. As a result, the two of them were sent to alternate dimensions: Kazuma ended up in Astral World, while Byron ended up in  Barian World . [5] [6] 
 
           Hart attacking Astral World.     
 Dr. Faker later made a pact with a  being  from Barian World that if he destroys Astral World, he would obtain the power to conquer the Earth. [7]  Therefore, he used  Hart Tenjo 's powers to transport large amounts of trash through a small hole in space into Astral World, where they would detonate. [8] [7]  However, this is revealed to be fraudulent and Faker had really made the deal in order to cure Hart's illness and the destruction of Astral World was the price the Barian demanded for his services. [9] 
 Following these attacks, Astral was sent to  Yuma Tsukumo 's world with a certain mission. Astral conjectured this was Kazuma's plan to defeat Byron, now Vetrix, and Dr. Faker's machinations. [10]  However, Vetrix speculated that Kazuma had sent Astral as his own instrument of revenge against Faker. [11]  In truth, Astral was sent in order to retrieve the  Numeron Code , an all-power card that can shape reality before the  Barians  are able to find it. [12] , with which he must use to annihilate  Barian World . [13]  and therefore allow Astral World to "Rank-up" to a higher realm of existence. [2] 
 
 Yu-Gi-Oh! ZEXAL 
 It is first seen when  Astral  obtains his third memory as as result of acquiring " Number 34: Terror-Byte ". Astral had not previously remembered where he came from. [14]  Astral later recalls Astral World under attack, being assaulted by numerous explosions as its unseen denizens scream. [15] 
 Astral World has a counterpart called  Barian World .  Kite Tenjo  correctly guessed that using a stone from that world found inside  Orbital 7  would open the  Emperor's Key , which comes from Astral World, and he mentioned the world itself when Astral questioned him about why he hunts the " Numbers ". [16]  Later during their Duel, Astral said a legendary power called  ZEXAL  can save his world. [17] 
 Astral World and another world sent a wave of energy that collided with the  Human World , causing time to temporarily stop and a sun from each world to appear.  Dr. Faker  explained that it is because the worlds are getting closer. Dr. Faker also said that something bad will happen soon because of this. [18] 
 When  Vetrix  began the ritual to steal Hart's powers, the former was able to briefly see Astral World while taking more power from the latter. [19]  The  Vetrix Family  as a whole seems to be familiar with Astral World as well, as  Trey  recognized Astral as a being from that world when he briefly saw him. [6] 
 After  Number 96  mastered the power of  Chaos , he opens a portal to this world and  Barian World , then he launches powerful attacks into both worlds and there were screams from the denizens of this world. [20] 
 Mentioned by  Eliphas , everything is capable of  Shining Draw  in this world and explained that it is the true Dueling style of his world. He told Yuma that Astral's mission was to destroy Barian World, which Astral has not accomplished and instead he became attacked and possessed by the  power of Chaos . Eliphas told Yuma that his partnership with Astral caused the problem. [21]  However, when Yuma was able to defeat Eliphas in a Duel, he and the citizens of Astral World became convinced of a new possibility for the future and that abandoning Chaos was a mistake, thereby allowing Yuma and a newly-revived Astral to end the war with Barian World as they saw fit. [3] 
 After defeating  Don Thousand , Astral later used the  Numeron Code  to reunite the high-energy dimensions into a single parallel world. Eliphas mentioned this also allowed Chaos to return, causing upcoming challenges to take place. [22] 
 
 Manga 
           The Astral World's brief appearance in the manga.     In the  manga ,  Dr. Faker  and  Mr. Heartland 's goal is to destroy  Astral World, because they claim that it is evil, and that otherwise our planet will be destroyed. They also refer to  Astral  as  Astral World's messenger, who should be destroyed as well. [23] [24]  According to Dr. Faker,  Haruto Tenjo  has a hidden power that allows him to communicate with the spirits of  Astral World. [25]  It seems that Haruto can also create powerful attacks, like a huge fireball, and send them directly to it through a portal. [23] 
 When Astral absorbs " No. 22: Zombiestein ", he recovers the memory of Astral World being under attack. [26] 
 Luna  tells  Shark  that Dr. Faker must be stopped. Also, after absorbing three consecutive "Numbers", Astral explains he recovered some memories: his enemy is Dr. Faker, who plans on using the hidden powers of the "Numbers" to destroy Astral World; However, it is linked to  this world . So, if Astral World is destroyed, this one will be destroyed as well. The  Numbers Club  then decide to save the world from Dr. Faker. [27] 
 In a flashback,  Kazuma Tsukumo  is shown telling  Akari Tsukumo  that he discovered Astral World. He explains that that's where Duel Monsters are from, and that supposedly, the souls of the people there exist in a higher plane than ours. Some time later, Kazuma and  Mirai  disappeared in Astral World. Kazuma appears to Akari as a spirit revealing that he found a way in to Astral World. He tells Akari that this world would soon suffer a great disaster and that Yuma would be the one to open a new path to save it, and gives Akari the  Emperor's Key  to give Yuma. [28] 
 
 Citizens 
 Like Astral, the residents of Astral World, minus  Kazuma Tsukumo  and  Mira Tsukumo , have varying shades of blue skin. They were injured by the attacks launched by  Hart Tenjo  and  Number 96 , causing them to suffer injuries such as cracking faces. Yuma was able to cure them with the power of  Chaos .

 Relationships 
 Earth 
 Just like its counterpart, Astral World and  Earth  are connected. When humans die, it is possible for them to be reincarnated in Astral World if their hearts are noble and pure. [29] 
 
 Barian World 
 Due to Astral World's desire to Rank-Up, any soul who possesses the power of  Chaos , was banished from this world, leading to the creation of  Barian World . To further its desire to Rank-Up, the Astral World sought to destroy Barian World through  Astral , but through  Kazuma  and  Yuma 's efforts, the world began to accept the power of Chaos. This mistake is resolved once a changed Astral used the  Numeron Code  to fuse the two worlds back together, which brought up many new challenges for the world in the process.
 
 Yuma Tsukumo 
 Unknowingly, through  Astral  bonding with his missing other half,  Yuma  managed to convinced  Eliphas  of their world's folly of banishing  Chaos -wielding souls from Astral World and trying to destroy  Barian World .
