 Summary 
 Yusei  and  Sect  race towards the  Machine Temple  where the  Ultimate God 's Shadow Miasma is surging. Sect gasps that the Ultimate God is still destroying  Seibal  and he states that they have to seal it fast. Yusei thinks that he only has 100  Life Points  left, no cards in his hand and only a single face-down card; they don't have much time to stop the Ultimate God's complete resurrection. He knows that he has to draw a specific card if he's going to settle the Duel, and he smiles and declares that now he's really psyched. Sect is shocked that Yusei can smile at a time like this and enjoy the Duel, and Yusei declares that he's coming; the next turn settles the Duel. He's putting his soul into this draw. He remembers  Crow ,  Jack ,  Akiza  and  Leo  and  Luna  as he thinks that he and his Deck have come through many fierce battles against many Duelists. He knows that it will respond to his feelings, and he draws and Summons " Quick Spanknight ". Sect realizes what Yusei is about to do, and Yusei  tunes  the  Level 4  " Junk Meister " with the  Level 3  "Quick Spanknight", declaring that this is his final  Synchro Summon  - " Lightning Warrior ". 
 With "Quick Spanknight" used as Synchro Material, its effect lowers the  ATK  of " Great Poseidon Beetle " by 500, to 2000, and Sect notes that Yusei is still trying to recreate their last  Turbo Duel . Yusei declares that he always fights at full power, and he's fighting the ultimate Duel right now. He activates his face-down card, " Bond’s Reward ", banishing  Synchro Monsters  from his  Graveyard  to increase the ATK of a Synchro Monster he controls by their  Levels  times 200. With "Lightning Warrior" drawing strength from its teammates' last wishes, " Stardust Spark Dragon " and " Gravity Warrior ", their combined Levels of 14 increasing the ATK of "Lightning Warrior" by 2800, to 5200. 
 Sect smiles and he admits that he knew it; he can't beat Yusei. That's Yusei Fudo for you;  Satellite 's toughest Turbo Duelist, and Sect's ideal. Even so, next time, no, until he wins, Sect isn't letting Yusei go no matter what. Yusei declares that they've got one last job to finish as they race up the final flight of stairs. They separate at the top of the stairs, thinking that Light  Sense  is the only way to seal the Ultimate God. In unison they declare, "Synchronize our thoughts! Amplify them to the max! Our Sense! Shining Armored Sense!" "Lightning Warrior" and "Great Poseidon Beetle" glow with Sense and both Yusei and Sect sprout white wings of Sense from their  Duel Runners . They race towards one another, and order the Ultimate God to vanish into the light. The monsters clash in a pillar of Light Sense, the Cross Sense Final Session. 
 The Shadow Miasma dissipates and Sect's LP falls to zero as they brake. The Machine Temple cracks and begins to fall apart, and the light glowing in the cracks of the humanoid Ultimate God statue fades. The strings binding Akiza rot away and she falls from the wall inside the temple. Yusei screams Akiza's name, and a voice orders him out of the way. Jack roars into the temple on his Duel Runner, retrieves Akiza, and gets out just in time. Yusei thanks Jack, and Jack asks Yusei who gave him permission to thank him as Akiza opens her eyes. Yusei looks at the mural on the wall depicting the  Duel Priests ' and  Duel Priestess 's  Duel Dragons , and he muses that the struggle for the Ultimate God has ended. Sect steps up to Yusei, and Yusei removes his glove and holds out his hand, telling Sect that it was an awesome Turbo Duel. He suggests that they go back home, back to Satellite where they belong. Sect and Yusei shake hands, and they stand together proudly with Sect wearing Yusei's goggles on his head again, Akiza looking on, and Jack glancing at them from over his shoulder.
 
 Featured Duel: Yusei Fudo vs. Sect Ijuin 
 Duel continues from  the previous Ride . 
 Turn 9: Yusei 
 Yusei   draws  and  Normal Summons  " Quick-Span Knight " (1000/800). He tunes "Quick-Span Knight" with " Junk Meister " to  Synchro Summon  " Lightning Warrior " (2400/1200). Since "Quick-Span Knight" was used for a Synchro Summon, its  effect   activates , reducing the  ATK  of " Great Poseidon Beetle " by 500 (2500 → 2000). Next, Yusei activates his  face-down  " Bond’s Reward ",  banishing  " Gravity Warrior " and " Stardust Spark Dragon " from his  Graveyard  in order to increase the ATK of "Lightning Warrior" by 200 times the total  Levels  of the banished  monsters ; since the Levels of "Gravity Warrior" and "Stardust Spark Dragon" sum up 14, "Lightning Warrior" gains 2800 ATK (2400 → 5200). Yusei  attacks  and  destroys  "Great Poseidon Beetle" with "Lightning Warrior" ( Sect  3200 → 0).

 Trivia 
 Author  Masahiro Hikokubo  came up with the idea to make the chapter seem like it was the final chapter of the manga, and the initial scripts reflected this with the taglines that appear in the  V Jump  magazine. Editor  Akira Ito  ended up changing it to a more implicit continuation just in case they lost readers who thought that the series was over.
