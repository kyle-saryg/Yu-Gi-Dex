      The love jigsaw puzzle written for  Miho Nosaka .     
 A  love jigsaw puzzle  is a love letter written on a jigsaw puzzle. The sender is to write a message on a blank puzzle, break it up and send it to a person they love. The receiver then assembles the puzzle to read the message.
 
 Events 
 Sugoroku Mutou  used one of these to meet  Yugi's  grandmother. [1] 
 In the  manga , Sugoroku sold one of these to  Hiroto Honda  to give to  Miho Nosaka . Honda got Yugi to write the letter, and he, Yugi and  Katsuya Jonouchi  hid it in Miho's desk before class. However, the teacher  Ms. Chono  found the puzzle during a desk inspection and began solving it herself, reading the message to the class and planned on expelling the sender. However  Dark Yugi  turned the jigsaw into a Shadow Game,  Dark Puzzle , in which Chono felt the pain she was inflicting on others. This caused her makeup to peel away in the shape of jigsaw pieces and reveal her ugly face. Chono then fled the classroom, without announcing or punishing the sender. [1] 
 In the  anime , Sugoroku instead sold the puzzle to  Mayumi , who had a crush on  Jonouchi .  Ms. Chono  found it during the inspection, but Mayumi changed her mind about Jonouchi after seeing how he treated the puzzle. [2]
