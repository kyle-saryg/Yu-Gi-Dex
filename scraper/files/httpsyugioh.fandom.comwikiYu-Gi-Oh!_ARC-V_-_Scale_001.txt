 Summary 
   This summary is currently incomplete. 
 In  Maiami City , which has benefited from the  Solid Vision  provided by the  Leo Corporation ,  Yuzu Hiiragi  and her father  Syuzo  are on the verge of their  Syu Zo Duel School  going bankrupt from the lack of students. Yuzu, having became money-oriented to make ends' meet, assumes the school's only chance is getting a celebrity  Duelist  under their payroll. By luck, Yuzu learns of a rogue Duelist known as the Phantom who wanted by Leo Corp for hacking into their computer systems and considers the hacker to be her last hope. At a quiet pier at the city's edge, a cloaked youth notices a boy crying over not see a  Duel Monsters  dragon materialized via Solid Vision. The youth sympathizes and, against a  voice in his head  remaining him that they are being hunted down, summons a  dragon  to cheer the boy up. However, this alerts Leo Corp as its teenaged CEO  Reiji Akaba  recognizes the cloaked youth on the monitor as the Phantom:  Yuya Sakaki . With the voice in his head scolding him for recklessly endangering them while noticing three helicopters approaching their area, Yuya explains that he is a  Dueltainer  and making people is important to him. At that time Yuzu notices the helicopters and deduces the Phantom is nearby as she decides to quickly find him before the authorities do.
 Riding in helicopters are three Duelists Reiji's personally selected to hunt down Yuya:  Shingo Sawatari ,  Shun Kurosaki , and  Sora Shiunin . The chopper holding Shingo lands on the rooftop once they find their quarry, with Shingo stepping out to personally take him on. But instead of Yuya, the Phantom unmasks himself as another youth named  Yuto  who will indulge the surprised Shingo.
