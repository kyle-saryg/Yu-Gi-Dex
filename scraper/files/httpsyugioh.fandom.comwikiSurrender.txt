 Rules 
 Players may concede a game at any point during a game or match, including during the opponent's turn. Once a match result is determined, the result is final and cannot be altered; it is too late for a player to concede. [1]  Players must clearly announce their intention to concede a game or match.
 Players may not offer nor accept any form of compensation for conceding. Players who partake in bribery or collusion violate Konami policy and will be subject to penalties for Unsporting Conduct—Cheating. [1] [2] 
 
 In the anime 
       Marik surrenders the duel against Yami Yugi.     
 In the anime, a player surrenders by placing their hand over their  Deck  or Duel Disk. This has occurred eleven times.  Mai Valentine  against  Téa Gardner , [3]  Mai Valentine against  Yami Yugi , [4]   Solomon Muto  against  Arthur Hawkins , [5]   Yugi Muto  against  Rebecca Hawkins , [5]   Johnny Steps  against Yami Yugi, [6]   Lumis  against Yami Yugi and  Seto Kaiba , [7]   Marik Ishtar  against Yami Yugi, [8]   Joey Wheeler  against Mai Valentine, [9]   Elroy Prescot  against  Belowski [10] ,  Reginald Kastle  against  Yuma Tsukumo [11] ,  Declan Akaba  against  Yuya Sakaki [12] , and Yuya Sakaki against  Yuto [13]  (dub only) [14] .
 Joey Wheeler , Yami Yugi,  Leon von Schroeder ,  Zane Truesdale ,  Aster Phoenix ,  Vellian Crowler ,  Jean-Louis Bonaparte ,  Greiger ,  Carly Carmine ,  Misty Tredwell ,  Pip ,  Yuma Tsukumo , and  Kite Tenjo  have attempted to surrender at least one of their Duels, albeit unsuccessfully.
 In the anime and manga, forfeiting occasionally shows the losing player's LP being reduced to 0, such as during the Duel between Marik and Yami Yugi.
 
 In Video Games 
 In most  video games , in contrast to the official  OCG  and  TCG  rules, there are several restrictions on how player can surrender. Examples are that the player is only allowed to surrender the Duel during their own  Main Phase  or  Battle Phase , or cannot do so until the 10th turn of the Duel or later.
 Usually, an AI opponent will never surrender, with the only known exception being the  Yata-Garasu Lockdown . In some games, surrendering a Duel shows the player's LP becoming 0.
 
 In real life 
 Surrendering is often informally known as  scooping , because after surrendering a player "scoops" up all of their cards and  shuffles  them back together in preparation for the next Duel.
 Surrendering can be used strategically in a  Match  if it would not result in a Match loss. For example, if the player is very unlikely to win from their current position, they can surrender to conceal specific cards or their overall Deck theme from their opponent.
