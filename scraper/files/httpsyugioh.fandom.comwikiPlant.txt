 Plant  ( 植 物   Shokubutsu ) monsters were very overlooked and weak until  support  for the  Type  was released in the  Crossroads of Chaos ,  Crimson Crisis  and  Raging Battle  booster sets. A general strategy for Plant Decks is to use cards like " Gigaplant ", " Lonefire Blossom " and " Lord Poison " to fill the field with powerful monsters. They can go hand-in-hand with  Insect -Types as well with cards like " Prickle Fairy ". 
 One of the strongest Plant monsters is " Tytannial, Princess of Camellias " at 2800 ATK. It has the power to negate any card effects that target simply by sacrificing a Plant monster (which in worst case scenario can even be herself). It can be easily Summoned by Tributing "Lonefire Blossom". In power and strategy, "Tytannial, Princess of Camellias" is followed by "Gigaplant", which has 2400 ATK and the power to Special Summon Plants from the Graveyard and hand. 
 Other notable Plant monsters include " Mystic Tomato ", " Spore ", " Dandylion ", " Botanical Lion ", " Glow-Up Bulb ", " Nettles ", " Cactus Fighter ", " Meliae of the Trees " and " Number 50: Blackship of Corn ".
 Plants also have Plant version of  staple  cards like " Solemn Judgment " and " Mirror Force ", in the forms of " Pollinosis " and " Wall of Thorns ", respectively. Plants have non-Plant support versions of " Marauding Captain " in form of " Twilight Rose Knight ", a version of " Witch of the Black Forest " in form of " Violet Witch ". Other Plant cards are very similar to certain non-Plant cards, for example: " Dark Verger " and " Quillbolt Hedgehog ". Other cards present similarities in the card images like " Wonder Clover " and " Break! Draw! ".
 The usual  Attributes  associated with Plants are  EARTH  or  WATER . Plant cards usually revolve around swarming and regenerating back onto the field. Unlike  Zombies , Plants are often used to fuel effects such as negations rather than for strictly attacking purposes. They have many cards that allow them to be Special Summoned from the Deck and hand but mostly from the Graveyard. Cards like "Lonefire Blossom", " Plant Food Chain ", "Lord Poison", "Gigaplant", " The World Tree " and " Miracle Fertilizer " all add major support to bringing back a swarm of Plant monsters to overwhelm the opponent. There are many good Plant  Tuner monsters , like " Copy Plant " and "Spore". 
 Plant monsters are used by  Akiza Izinski  in  Yu-Gi-Oh! 5D's . Her  signature card , " Black Rose Dragon ", is a  staple  in Plant-reliant Decks. Plant monsters also appear in  Yu-Gi-Oh! ZEXAL ,  used by  Tombo Tillbitty  and  Lotus Hanazoe . Tombo plays with a " Tomato " deck, while Lotus plays a Plant deck with a focus on Special Summoning Plants to Xyz Summon " Battlecruiser Dianthus ," which is later Ranked Up to Summon " CXyz Battleship Cherry Blossom ". In  Yu-Gi-Oh! ARC-V ,  Yuri  uses a " Predaplant " Deck focused on manipulating the stats of the opponent's monsters to weaken them, disrupting their strategies, or using them as  Fusion Materials  for their own bosses. In   Yu-Gi-Oh! VRAINS ,  Specter  uses a " Sunvine "/" Sunavalon " Deck focused on manipulating the tide of the Duel. In  Yu-Gi-Oh! SEVENS ,  Rayne Nanahoshi  and   Rino Nanahoshi  both user the  Flowerfang  archetype both with different key monsters and different overall strategies.
 Legacy of the Valiant  introduced the " Sylvan " archetype, the first one composed solely of Plant monsters. They are focus on the  excavate  mechanic, have a high variety of Levels and Attributes, being able to build a very flexible Deck, and their effects rely on taking advantage of when they are excavated and sent to the Graveyard; those effects range from  searching a monster  and  recycling cards  to  destroying a monster  and  reorganizing the Deck  in order to use their effects at their best.
 The " Aroma " archetype is largely composed of Plant monsters, and focuses on gaining advantage through having higher  LP  than the opponent.

 Plant  Beatdown 
 This deck revolves around "Lonefire Blossom" and "Gigaplant" to help swarm the field. Make sure you use the effect of "Gigaplant" effectively in order to pull decent Synchro Monsters out while using " Queen of Thorns " to make your opponent pay life points to summon non-plant monsters. You could use " Tytannial, Princess of Camellias " and combo it with "Gigaplant" so you could tribute Plant monsters Special Summoned by "Gigaplant"'s effect to negate any cards that target your plant monsters. You can also keep the opponent at bay with powerful cards like "Wall of Thorns". This deck also uses "Pollinosis" or "Tytannial, Princess of Camellias" to negate Spells and Traps that destroy multiple monsters such as " Lightning Vortex " or "Mirror Force" or " Torrential Tribute ", however, this can be entirely foiled with cards like " Zombie World " and " DNA Surgery ", so be sure to pack in " Mystical Space Typhoon ". This deck's ability to swarm the field quickly for fuel or for an all out attack can be foiled by cards like these.

 This is a deck utilizing " Supervise " and " Hidden Armory " which allows players to Synchro Summon quickly with the main monsters "Gigaplant" and " Spore ". This can Summon a variety of different Synchros to control the field, but most used is " Power Tool Dragon ", which allows the player to grab a quick "Supervise".

 Chaos Plants 
 The successor to the very popular Plant Synchro Deck, Chaos Plants takes advantage of the LIGHT and DARK attributes of  splashable  monsters, such as  Tour Guide From the Underworld  and " Effect Veiler ", to Summon " Black Luster Soldier - Envoy of the Beginning ", in combination with the Synchro abilities of Plants. It rarely uses enough Lights and Darks for it to be worth using " Chaos Sorcerer ". Something to note is that it despite being called a "Plant" Deck, it often uses more  Fiend  monsters than Plants.
