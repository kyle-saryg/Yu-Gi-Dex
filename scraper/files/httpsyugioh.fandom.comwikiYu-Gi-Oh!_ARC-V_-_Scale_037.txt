 Summary 
 At the brink of her defeat,  Eve  plays the card that  Yuya  tried to destroy:  Genesis Omega Dragon .
 
 Featured Duel: Yuya Sakaki/Yuto/Yugo/Yuri vs. Eve/G.O.D. 
 Duel continues from the previous Scale . 
 Turn 5: Yuya Sakaki 
" Odd-Eyes Phantom Dragon " attacks  Eve  directly. Since there are no  monsters  on her  field , Eve activates the Pendulum Effect of " Mystic Hell Gate ",  destroying  the cards in her  Pendulum Zone , and  Special Summoning  a  Pendulum Monster  from her hand. "Mystic Hell Gate" and " Mystic Heaven Gate " are destroyed, and " Genesis Omega Dragon " (0/0) is Special Summoned.
 At this point, Eve fuses with  "Genesis Omega Dragon" , who takes possession of her.
 "Odd-Eyes Phantom Dragon" attacks "Genesis Omega Dragon", but the latter's  effect  activates: by placing one Pendulum Monster from its  Deck ,  hand  or  Extra Deck  to its Pendulum Zone, G.O.D.  negates the attack  or  card effect  that targeted it. G.O.D. targets " Nova Portal " ( PS  12), negates the attack of "Odd-Eyes Phantom Dragon" and ends Yuya's turn.
 Turn 6: G.O.D. 
At the start of each player's  turn , "Genesis Omega Dragon" gains 1000  ATK  ("Genesis Omega Dragon": 0 → 1000 ATK). G.O.D. activates its effect,  destroying  cards on the field, up to the number of monsters in its Pendulum Zone. G.O.D. has one monster, and thus destroys "Odd-Eyes Phantom Dragon". "Genesis Omega Dragon" attacks Yuya directly, who activates the Pendulum Effect of " Enter-Mate Odd-Eyes Valet ". The latter's effect reduces  battle damage , up to the number face-up Pendulum Monsters in the Extra Deck times 300. Since he has four monsters, Yuya reduces the damage taken by 1200, therefore taking no damage.
 Duel continues in the next Scale .
