 Events 
 Katsuya Jonouchi  cycled through the district on his way to school, in a rush to not be late. His hurriedness caused him to be soaked when Sanpei was emptying a bucket of water and to bump into a  policeman , knocking him over.
 Aigami  later sent Jonouchi to an alternate dimension, constructed by his memories, Jonouchi recognized this street. He was again splashed by Sanpei emptying the bucket, but neither Sanpei nor the policeman acknowledged Jonouchi's existence.
