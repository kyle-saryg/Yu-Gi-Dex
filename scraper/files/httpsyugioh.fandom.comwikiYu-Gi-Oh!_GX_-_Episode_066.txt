 "Going Bananas" , known as  "Judai's "First Dream of the Year" Duel!"  in the Japanese version, is the sixty-sixth episode of the  Yu-Gi-Oh! GX  anime. This episode is a clip show.
 Jaden Yuki  makes his way back towards  Duel Academy , and meets  Wheeler  the monkey, and has a series of hallucinations and flashbacks.
 
 Summary 
 Syrus Truesdale  and  Tyranno Hassleberry  are eating in the  Slifer Red  dorm, and the dinner is  Jaden Yuki 's favorite - fried shrimp. They eat the shrimp that was intended for Jaden, as he isn't there, and hope that wherever he is, he's not starving. Jaden is still wandering through the forest at the point, and comments that he suddenly tastes fried shrimp, which only makes him hungrier.  Wheeler  the monkey is also in the forest, pushing a large cart of discarded furniture. He finds Jaden, who has collapsed from hunger. He wakes him up, and Jaden hallucinates that the cart of furniture is really " Ancient Gear Golem ". Jaden then has a flashback to his Duel with  Dr. Crowler  in  episode 1 .
 After that, Jaden sees Wheeler hitting his cart with his fist, and imagines that he's  Bastion Misawa , thus having a flashback to his Duel with him in  episode 22 . After this, he imagines that Wheeler is actually  Chazz Princeton  and has flashbacks to their Duel in episode  episode 4 . After this, he proceeds to imagine that the monkey is  Zane Truesdale  and flashes back to  episode 8 . After that's over, Wheeler throws a bucket of water at Jaden, and this finally wakes him up fully. He also gives him a bunch of bananas to eat. Jaden thanks him, and heads off to continue his trip back to  Duel Academy . However, he ends up going the wrong way, this despite the fact that Duel Academy is visible through the trees in the direction he doesn't take. There is also a sign in that direction pointing towards Duel Academy. Jaden's stupidity actually causes the  inanimate roadsign  to  sweat drop and face fault .
