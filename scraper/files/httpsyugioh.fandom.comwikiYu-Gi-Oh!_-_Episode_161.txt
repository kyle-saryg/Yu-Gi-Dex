 Resentful opponents 
 Both  Weevil  and  Rex  claim that they're doing this because of the shame and humiliation they had to go through after they were kicked out of the  Duelist Kingdom  tournament. But, then again, they did play dirty, since Weevil would demand a Rare Card in exchange for a simple autograph. 
 Their opponents are not moved at all by their tales and keep on Dueling. 
 Featured Duels 
 Featured Duel #1: Rex Raptor vs. Joey Wheeler - Part 2 
 Duel continues from previous episode. 
 Both players still have 4000  Life Points  remaining.
 Joey controls "Panther Warrior" (2000/1600) in Attack Position and one set card.
 Rex controls "Kaitoptera" (1900/1000) and two "Gilasaurus" (1900/400) in Attack Position, " The Seal of Orichalcos " and one set card.
 Turn 3: Rex Raptor 
Rex draws " Polymerization " and subsequently  activates  it to fuse " Kaitoptera " with one " Gilasaurus " in order to Fusion Summon " Horned Saurus " (2000 → 2500/1000) in  Attack Position .  Rex  then  Normal Summons  " Giant Rex " (2000 → 2500/1200) in  Attack Position . Since  Joey  controls a  monster , the  negative effect  of "Giant Rex" does not apply and it is able to attack. "Horned Saurus" then attacks directly through its own effect ( Joey  4000 → 1500). "Giant Rex" attacks & destroys Joey's " Panther Warrior " ( Joey  1500 → 1000). "Gilasaurus" attacks directly, but Joey activates his face-down " Scapegoat " to  Special Summon  four " Sheep Tokens " (0/0 for all) in  Defense Position . A replay occurs and "Gilasaurus" attacks and destroys Joey's first "Sheep Token".
 Turn 4: Joey Wheeler 
Joey draws. He then  Normal Summons  " Rocket Warrior " (1500/1300) in  Defense Position  and  Sets  two Cards.
 Turn 5: Rex Raptor  
Rex draws. " Horned Saurus " attacks Joey's "Rocket Warrior", but Joey activates his face-down " Magic Arm Shield " to take  control  of Rex's "Gilasaurus" and makes it the new attack target of "Horned Saurus". Rex then activates his face-down " Jurassic Heart " to negate "Magic Arm Shield" and destroy it. "Horned Saurus" then destroys Joey's "Rocket Warrior". "Giant Rex" attacks and destroys Joey's second "Sheep Token". "Gilasaurus" attacks and destroys Joey's third "Sheep Token". Rex then Sets a Card.
 Turn 6: Joey Wheeler 
Joey draws "Red-Eyes B. Dragon". He then activates " Star Blaster " to target his last "Sheep Token" and roll a die. The die result will be added to the Level of the Sheep Token and after that happens Joey can Tribute his Sheep Token to summon a monster from his hand whose Level is the same as the Sheep Token's. The die result is a 6, so Joey increases the Level of the Sheep Token by 6 ("Sheep Token": Level 1 → 7), making it a Level 7 monster. Joey then Tributes the Sheep Token to  Special Summon  " Red-Eyes Black Dragon " (2400/2000) in  Attack Position . 
 Joey then activates his face-down " Metalmorph ", equipping it to "Red-Eyes Black Dragon" and increasing its  ATK  and  DEF  by 300 ("Red-Eyes Black Dragon": 2400 → 2700/2000 → 2300). Now when "Red-Eyes Black Dragon" attacks an opponent's monster, it will gain ATK equal to half the ATK of the attack target during damage calculation. 
 "Red-Eyes Black Dragon" attacks Rex's "Horned Saurus". The effect of "Metalmorph" activates ("Red-Eyes Black Dragon": 2700 → 3950/2300). "Red-Eyes Black Dragon" destroys "Horned Saurus" ( Rex Raptor  4000 → 2550). After damage calculation, the effect of "Metalmorph" expires ("Red-Eyes B. Dragon": 3950 → 2700/2300). Joey Sets a Card.
 Turn 7: Rex Raptor 
Rex draws. He then Tributes "Gilasaurus" and "Giant Rex" in order to Tribute Summon " Tyrant Dragon " (2900 → 3400/2500) in Attack Position.
 Duel concludes next episode. 
 
 Featured Duel #2: Weevil Underwood vs. Yami Yugi - Part 2 
 Duel continues from previous episode. 
 Yami Yugi has 2700  Life Points  remaining and controls "Obnoxious Celtic Guardian" (1400/1200) in Attack Position.
 Weevil has 3900 Life Points and controls "Leghul" (800/350) and "Pheromone Wasp" (1300/800) in Attack Position, "Parasite Caterpillar" (equipped to "Obnoxious Celtic Guardian"), " The Seal of Orichalcos ", "Insect Barrier", and one set card.
 Turn 4: Yami Yugi 
Yami Yugi draws. 1 Turn has passed since the activation of the effect of " Parasite Caterpillar " on Yami Yugi's " Obnoxious Celtic Guardian " (2 Turns remaining). Yami Yugi activates " Polymerization " to fuse " Curse of Dragon " with " Gaia The Fierce Knight " and  Fusion Summon  " Gaia The Dragon Champion " (2600/2100) in  Attack Position . "Gaia the Dragon Champion" attacks  Weevil 's " Leghul ", but Weevil activates his face-down " DNA Surgery " and declares Insect for its effect. Now as long as this card is face-up, all Monsters on the Field become the declared type. Because of this and Weevil's " Insect Barrier ", "Gaia the Dragon Champion" cannot attack.
 Turn 5: Weevil Underwood 
Weevil draws " Cell Division " and subsequently  activates  it to target "Leghul" and  Special Summon  a " Cell Division Token " with the same stats as "Leghul" (300 → 800/350) in Attack Position. Weevil then Tributes " Pheromone Wasp " and the " Cell Division Token " in order to Tribute Summon " Insect Queen " (2200 → 2700/2400) in Attack Position. Due the effect of "Insect Queen", it gains 200  ATK  for each  Insect - Type  Monster on the Field. There are currently four ("Insect Queen": 2700 → 3500/2400). "Leghul" attacks directly via its own effect ( Yami Yugi  2700 → 1900). 
 Weevil then Tributes "Leghul" ("Insect Queen": 3500 → 3300/2400) in order to allow "Insect Queen" to attack. "Insect Queen" attacks and destroys Yami Yugi's "Gaia the Dragon Champion" ( Yami Yugi  1900 → 1200) ("Insect Queen": 3300 → 3100/2400). Since "Insect Queen" destroyed a monster by battle, its last effect activates, allowing Weevil to  Special Summon  an " Insect Monster Token " (100 → 600/100) to his side of the field in  Attack Position  ("Insect Queen": 3100 → 3300/2400).
 Turn 6: Yami Yugi 
Yami Yugi draws. 2 Turns have passed since the activation of the effect of "Parasite Caterpillar" on Yami Yugi's "Obnoxious Celtic Guardian" (1 Turn remaining). Yami Yugi then Normal Summons " Kuriboh " (300/200) in  Defense Position  ("Insect Queen": 3300 → 3500/2400) and Sets a card.
 Duel concludes next episode. 
 
 Differences in Adaptation 
 The scene where "Gaia the Dragon Champion" sprouting insect parts when "DNA Surgery" is activated is edited so that everything that protrudes from the monster is made all glowy in an attempt to tone down the graphic transformation. When this episode aired on Sky 1 in the UK when they had the broadcast rights, this scene was removed entirely. 
 In the dub, Yami Yugi warns Weevil to watch out for the underpass before they ducked for it. This was not mentioned in the original version. 
 Insect Queen's breast plates are recolored from yellow to red in the dub despite that in her first appearances in the dubbed episodes where her appearance was unchanged. 
 Errors 
 In the dub, Rex states that he resents Joey for knocking him out of the  Duelist Kingdom  tournament. However, Rex had five  Star Chips  before his Duel with Joey in Duelist Kingdom, and Joey only took two of them following Rex's defeat.
