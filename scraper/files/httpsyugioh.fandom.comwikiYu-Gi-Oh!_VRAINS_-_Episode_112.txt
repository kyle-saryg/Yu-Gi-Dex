 LINK VRAINS , which should have been shut down, is now open again, and many citizens of  Den City  begin to log in. In order to search for clues about  Ai , who has taken over  SOL ,  Soulburner  decides to investigate LINK VRAINS. There, he discovers an island he has never seen before. On the island is a country filled with household appliances. Soulburner then encounters  Roboppi  in the country.
 
 Featured Duel: Soulburner vs. Roboppi 
         
 The Duel is conducted as a  Master Duel .
 Turn 1: Roboppi Roboppi activates the  Field Spell  " Appliancer Electrilyrical World ", whose effect lets Roboppi add 1 " Appliancer " Spell Card from his Deck to his hand when it is activated. He adds an unspecified card. He then  Normal Summons  " Appliancer Socketroll " (100/100) and then uses the effect of the " Appliancer Copybokkle " in his hand, targeting "Socketroll" to  Special Summon  "Copybokkle" (???/0) and change its name to that of the targeted monster. As another "Socketroll" was Special Summoned, the effect of the first "Socketroll" lets Roboppi Special Summon a third "Socketroll" from his Deck. He uses a "Socketroll" and "Copybokkle" treated as "Socketroll" to Link Summon " Appliancer Celtopus " (0/LINK-2/↙↓) to the  Extra Monster Zone . He then uses the last "Socketroll" to Link Summon " Appliancer Propelion " (1200/LINK-1/↑). As Roboppi Link Summoned an "Appliancer" Link Monster, the second effect of "Electrilyrical World" lets him add 1 "Appliancer" from his  GY  to his hand. He returns "Socketroll". Roboppi activates " Appliancer Reuse ", letting him Special Summon a Level 4 or lower "Appliancer" monster from his GY, at the cost of shuffling it into the Deck when it leaves the field. He Special Summons "Socketroll", then uses it to Link Summon " Appliancer Vacculephant " (1000/LINK-1/↗). Roboppi sets 2 cards.
