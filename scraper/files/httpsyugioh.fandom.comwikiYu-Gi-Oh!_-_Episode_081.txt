 Summary 
 Seto Kaiba  is waiting with his brother  Mokuba  for the  Battle City  finalists to arrive. The first three finalists,  Yugi ,  Joey  and  Mai  arrive with their friends ( Tristan ,  Serenity ,  Téa  and  Duke ).  Marik Ishtar , the next finalist, arrives but is still using his disguise of Namu. Joey is suspicious about his true motives, but eventually dismisses it.  Bakura  arrives even though he is still injured and announces he is also a finalist, baffling everyone.  Odion Ishtar  comes in at this point, creating a commotion as Yugi, Kaiba and Joey recognize him as Marik, and Odion continues to identify himself as Marik and another finalist. 
 
       Bakura reveals his 6  Locator Cards .     
 Mokuba introduces  Kaiba Craft 3 , a huge airship where the finals will take place. The airship lands and all the contestants enter, although Yugi's friends are initially not allowed as they are not finalists but Mokuba persuades Kaiba to let them on. Kaiba orders the airship to leave, even though the remaining finalist has not arrived but at the last minute  Ishizu Ishtar  enters with a mask over her face to conceal her identity. Since she is the finalist, the Battle Ship can take off without delay.
 The finalists spend time alone in their designated rooms, except for Joey who is with Serenity and later Tristan, Téa and Duke, who do not have their own rooms. Yugi plans his deck while talking to Yami Yugi and they agree that Bakura is once again under the influence of the  Millennium Ring . The finalists are called to the main hall to decide who will duel first.
 
 Differences in adaptations 
 A scene of  Yami Bakura  violently eating steak and saying "Not enough blood." is removed from the dub.
 When Marik is standing, shots of Yami Bakura, Odion, and Yami Yugi are superimposed over him.
 
 Errors 
 When Yugi, Joey, and Mai are asked to show their six locator cards, all three show seven cards instead of six.
 After Bakura reveals he is a finalist, the scene of Marik (still in the guise of Namu) shows him without a Duel Disk.
 When  Roland  and  Fuguta  announce that the actual location is on a blimp, Marik is still seen without a Duel Disk, and Kaiba mistakenly has his on his right arm, but then it switches back to his left arm, like everyone else's shown.
 Mokuba calls Fuguta "Roland" in this episode.
