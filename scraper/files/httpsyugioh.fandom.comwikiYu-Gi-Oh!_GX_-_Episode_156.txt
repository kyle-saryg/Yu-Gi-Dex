 " Judai Revived!? A Brand New Journey " is the one hundred fifty-sixth episode of the  Yu-Gi-Oh! GX  anime. It first aired in Japan on October 10, 2007. This is the only episode of Season 3 not dubbed. This episode is a clip show.
 Jaden 's friends are returned to  Duel Academy , though Jaden himself does not. They reminisce about the events of the past three years and their memories of Jaden.
 
 Summary 
   This summary is currently incomplete. 
 Chancellor Sheppard  sits in his office, discussing the recent events with  Dr. Crowler . He flips through files of the students that are still missing -  Jaden Yuki ,  Zane Truesdale ,  Bastion Misawa  and  Adrian Gecko . Crowler states that though they are gone, their sacrifices enabled himself and the other students to return. Sheppard instructs Crowler to take the files to the  Abandoned Dorm , where they keep the files of other missing students.
 At the  Slifer Red  dorm,  Syrus Truesdale ,  Atticus Rhodes ,  Chazz Princeton ,  Alexis Rhodes  and  Tyranno Hassleberry  sit and discuss their past. Alexis comments that only a week has gone by since their return, but it feels like so much longer. Syrus is insistent that Jaden is still alive somewhere, and runs from the room after Chazz attempts to convince him otherwise. They discuss their previous duels with Jaden and flashbacks to various previous episodes are shown.
 Chazz regrets that he lost such a strong opponent, but manages to anger himself by recalling his losses to Jaden. Hassleberry quips that Chazz wouldn't have ever been able to beat Jaden. Chazz responds that he once at least cornered him and would have won if the duel had continued. He's referring to their duel in  episode 2 , but Alexis reveals what Jaden showed her afterwards - he had drawn " Monster Reborn " on the last turn and if the duel hadn't been interrupted, Jaden would have been able to revive " Elemental Hero Flame Wingman " and win the duel. Chazz is not happy to hear this and yells at Jaden to come back so he can beat him.
 As Syrus sits alone outside and stares up at the stars, he recalls Jaden's time as  The Supreme King  and other events in the alternate dimensions. He sees a falling star and wishes that he will be able to see Jaden again. The star continues towards Earth and crashes in the forest around  Duel Academy . Syrus hurries towards it, and out of the wreckage of the asteroid steps Jaden, alive and well. He asks Syrus if the Slifer Red dorm served  fried shrimp  today (In previous episodes in the Japanese version, fried shrimp was Jaden's favorite food; the English version changed most references to it to  corn dogs ).
