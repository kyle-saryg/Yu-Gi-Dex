 憧 れたあの 日 目指 して　 僕 は 闘 う 
きらめく 強 さが　 Ｃａｒｄ に 宿 る

 諦 めたくはないから 
 加速 する 疾風 に 乗 って 迎 えるんだ 
 明日 すら 愛 おしくなるほどの 僕 の 夢 
あの 雲 を 突 き 抜 けて　 眩 しい 夢 を 青空 に 描 こう

 Rettsu sutāto! Isshun no senkō kara 
Rettsu faindo! Sō, boku ga iku beki Wei 
Rettsu sutāto! Otanoshimi wa kore kara 
Redī gō! Riaru no maku ake 
Kitai, fuan no mirai ga ima ugokidasu 
Tashika na negai ga koko ni aru kara Donto wōrī 
Akogareta ano hi mezashite boku wa tatakau 
Kirameku tsuyosa ga Kādo ni yadoru 
Appu/Daun wo kurikaeshi nagara 
Fīru Itto! Kodō ga Ba,Ba,Ba,Bān! 
Furikitta genkai wo mata norikoete boku wa tsuyoku naru 
Akirametaku wa nai kara 
Kasoku suru kaze ni notte mukaerunda 
Ashita sura ito'oshikunaru hodo no boku no yume 
Ano kumo wo tsukinukete mabushī yume wo aozora ni egakō 
Rettsu sutāto! Isshun no senkō kara 
Rettsu faindo! Sō, boku ga iku beki Wei 
Rettsu sutāto! Otanoshimi wa kore kara 
Redī gō! Riaru no maku ake
 
 
 
 Let's start! From a moment's glint of light 
Let's find! Yes, the way I should go 
Let's start! The real fun's just getting started 
Ready go! Raise the curtains on reality 
The anticipated yet uneasy future will launch this moment 
Our firm desires are here, don't worry 
Aiming for the day I yearned for, I'll fight 
Radiant strength dwells in the cards 
Up and down, over and over again 
Feel it! The beat bu-bu-bu-burn! 
Transcend those limits I shook off once again, I'll be strong 
I don't ever want to give up 
Ride that accelerating gale and spread my arms in welcome 
For my dream that makes even tomorrow a beautiful sight 
Pierce through those clouds and paint my dazzling dreams upon that azure sky 
Let's start! From that moment's glint of light 
Let's find! Yes, the way I should go 
Let's start! The real fun's just getting started 
Ready go! Raise the curtains on reality
