 Appearance 
 The Legendary Signer appears as a tall, well-built man with numerous red feathers adorning his body (three on his upper arms, three on his ankles, and three on his head), large golden hoop earrings, a cloth wrapped around his waist as a loincloth, white bandages (on his upper arms, his head and his left thigh) to hold his feathers in place, golden anklets, golden gauntlets, a golden neck brace and a tribal necklace featuring large aqua blue oval-shaped gems. The most striking features of his appearance, however, are a small oval-shaped orange gem in the middle of his forehead, the full Mark of the Dragon on his left pectoral, a pair of scarlet stripes (parallel to each other) above his eyebrows, below his eyes and along his nose, and his eyes, which are pinkish-red sclerae that feature no visible irises or pupils.
 
 Biography 
 Battle with the Crimson Devil 
       The Legendary Signer faces the Crimson Devil.     
 The  Crimson Dragon  and its  servants :  Ancient Fairy Dragon ,  Black Rose Dragon ,  Black-Winged Dragon ,  Red Dragon Archfiend  and  Stardust Dragon  fought the Crimson Devil,  Red Nova .
 The Signer came forward from the ashes of a volcano and performed a miracle. He was able to absorb the Crimson Dragon's power, through  Blazing Soul , and used it to defeat and seal the Crimson Devil.
 
 
 Legacy 
       The Legendary Signer superimposed over Jack.     
 When  Jack Atlas  faced the Crimson Devil's servant, the  Familiar of Red Nova , he spoke of  Blazing Soul , which reminded  Greiger  of the Legendary Signer. Using Burning Soul, Jack absorbed the power of the Crimson Devil and created the card " Red Nova Dragon ", which he used to defeat the Familiar.
