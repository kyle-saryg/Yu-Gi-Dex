 Tips:
If you have two memmory cards the first thing you should do is trade all of the cards from the starter decks to one memmory card by restarting the game on the other memmory card after giving all of the cards to the other. (Even the weak ones as some of these are hard or imposible to obtain otherwise.
 The AI in this game are relatively weak, the challenging part of the game is assembling a good deck, not beating them. Themed decks such as the most common two: Insect and Zombie decks can easily defeat even the final bosses (there are two). The best strategy is to pick either Partician of darkness or Fairy King Truesendale and then face Bonez or Weevile respectively. Once you have a decent deck, aim for slot rares (lining up three of the same cards in the graveyard slots) these are better most of the time than anything you could find in an opponents graveyard. There are passwords and lists on line that tell you which cards you can get from slot rares, use these to build a great deck. It can also be worthwhile to rank-up certain cards to be used as deck leaders. If you use a zombie deck Pumpking is a very usefull early deck leader who gains +500 atk for zombies within two squares of him. After you beat the game on both sides it is easy to level up these three deck leaders: Dark Plant, Steel Scorpion, and Pettiet Moth. They make excellent deck leaders at high levels, but the only way to get them there is to level them up in custom duel using map edits that sevearly hinder the opponent AI.
