For the composition, see  Eyecatch (composition) .      
 An  eyecatch  is a scene or illustration used to begin and end a commercial break in a TV program, especially in  anime  and  tokusatsu  shows.
 Each  Yu-Gi-Oh!  anime series before ZEXAL has a different kind of eyecatch, although they are usually replaced with different graphics in the dubbed version, and removed in some international dubs.

 Yu-Gi-Oh! (Toei anime) 
 The  first anime series ' eyecatch for the begin of the commercial break shows the  Millennium Puzzle , which then shatters, and  Yami Yugi 's silhouette appears with the series' logo beside him. The eyecatch for the end of the commercial break shows the series' logo with the  Eye of Anubis  over it; Yami Yugi's silhouette then appears from underneath, more zoomed in, and inside it a wall with Egyptian hieroglyphics is seen. Then, the background also changes to the wall, and a fissure in the  Eye of Anubis  in the wall is zoomed in, and the episode resumes.

 Yu-Gi-Oh! GX 
 Yu-Gi-Oh! GX  has two different sets of eyecatches; all of them show the characters who were most relevant in the episode, usually the characters who  Duel  in it, sometimes with their main  monster  shown in the background. In the beginning, the first eyecatch showed one character, and the second, the other one. Later, starting on season 3, the first eyecatch was skipped, with the  Yu-Gi-Oh! GX  logo being shown in the down right corner instead, and  the second one shows both characters (more than 2 sometimes).

 Yu-Gi-Oh! 5D's 
 Yu-Gi-Oh! 5D's  too have 2 different sets of eyecatches, although they didn't change from episode to episode. The first set was used for seasons 1 and 2, and showed  Yusei   Summoning  " Junk Warrior " (the first one in a Ground  Duel  and the second one in a  Turbo Duel ). The second set was used from season 3 to 5, and showed two shots of Yusei with " Stardust Dragon " (also in a Ground and in a Turbo Duel).

 Yu-Gi-Oh! ZEXAL onwards 
 Yu-Gi-Oh! ZEXAL  and all subsequent series do not have eyecatch animations. Instead, their logo is shown in the bottom-left corner at the start and end of the commercial break.
