 Biography 
 Mask of Light, along with  Mask of Darkness , was ordered by  Marik  to Duel  Seto Kaiba  and  Dark Yugi  in a Tag-Team Duel. They were Dueling atop a skyscraper, and each player is standing on glass. The loser's glass will shatter, and will fall to the bottom of the skyscraper, killing the loser. During the Duel, Mask of Light and Mask of Darkness heavily relied on teamwork, unlike Kaiba and Yugi, and were using a " Mask " Deck, preventing their opponents from Tributing monsters to Summon Kaiba's " Obelisk ", or Yugi's " Slifer ". However, Kaiba used " Soul Exchange " to Tribute Yugi's monsters to Summon "Obelisk". He then defeated Mask of Darkness with "Obelisk", making Mask of Light scared for Mask of Darkness, due to the glass shattering underneath him, and Mask of Light  forfeited . Marik took over his mind to talk to Yugi and Kaiba, and fell unconscious. Marik presumably killed him afterwords.
