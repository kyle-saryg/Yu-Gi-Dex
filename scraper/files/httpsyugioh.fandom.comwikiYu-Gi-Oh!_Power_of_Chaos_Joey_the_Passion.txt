 Yu-Gi-Oh! Power of Chaos: Joey the Passion  is the third  Yu-Gi-Oh!  game for PC. It is also the final game of the  Power of Chaos  game series. The game features 771 cards, including 234 new cards and 466 cards which were introduced in the previous two games of the series.
 This game features Yugi's friend  Joey Wheeler  as the opponent and typically urban themed menus and fields. The game also adds new dueling choices, new dueling options and more Decks for the opponent, making this the  Power of Chaos  game with the most content. 
 The cards from the previous two games, if installed, are included. New game features include a ranked difficulty for the computer opponent, denoted by a star gauge in the Duel menu, which ranks from 1 star to 9. As you win duels, the difficulty increases, and the opponent swaps his Deck for a more potent one every time this happens. Later difficulty levels (8-9) allow the opponent to use different Decks in that same level. Losing consecutive duels results in decreased difficulty for the first time in Power of Chaos games. Other options include allowing the opponent to use cards from the previous two games, increasing the difficulty. Also, the option to make many  Limited  cards  Forbidden  is given, making the game more balanced. One other new addition to the game is that when you win cards that you already have, you may have a choice of getting different cards, or keep the ones you've earned. This can only be done when every card you win in a match or one card in a single duel is a common card, not new. Last, you can also duel a friend via LAN or via Gameranger.
