 Summary 
 Halldor 's " Gjallarhorn " has protected his " Aesirs " from  Yusei 's Trap, and furthermore, Yusei now has three turns left to win the Duel. Facing down the three "Aesir," which all grant beneficial bonuses to Halldor when they are revived by their effects, Yusei can only defend with " Stardust Phantom ," which when destroyed will allow him to  Special Summon  " Stardust Dragon " back from his  Graveyard  and have it lower its DEF by 800 to prevent its destruction, allowing him to weather all three of the "Aesir's" attacks. But Halldor gains an extra chance with the effect of " Speed World 2 ," destroying "Stardust Phantom" and Summoning "Stardust Dragon," but now he has enough attacks to destroy "Stardust Dragon." In turn, Yusei counters with his " Stronghold Guardian " to give "Stardust Dragon" enough DEF to survive the attacks. Halldor then shortens Yusei's time to win even further, by Summoning " Jormungardr the Nordic Serpent " and " Fenrir the Nordic Wolf " to Yusei's field. "Jormungand" will inflict 3000 damage to Yusei when switched to Attack Position, while "Fenrir" not only inflicts any battle damage it inflicts to both players, but also forces Yusei's monsters into Attack Position during his Battle Phase. 
 Rather than falter, Yusei instead uses " Hope for Escape ", taking advantage of his Life Points being so much lower than Halldor's to draw more cards, then uses the new cards to bring out " Formula Synchron " while also getting rid of "Jormungand". With the Mark of the Crimson Dragon behind him, he accelerates, performing an  Accel Synchro  to call out " Shooting Star Dragon ", and then uses " Speed Spell - Star Force " to  Release  "Fenrir" and power up "Shooting Star Dragon". Yusei then utilizes the effect of his "Shooting Star Dragon" and he gets three Tuner monsters, so "Shooting Star Dragon" gains three attacks. Yusei's monster then destroys all three "Aesirs" which only angers Halldor even more. Halldor notes if Yusei had gotten a fourth Tuner he could have attacked him directly and win. The "Aesirs" all revive, and Halldor decides to end the Duel now.
 Halldor uses " Odin's Eye " again, but also uses the effect of " Tyr of the Nordic Champions " to make his Aesirs immune to "Odin's Eye" this turn. Before he can find out what Yusei's plan is, Yusei quickly uses " Trick Mirror " to make the effect of "Odin's Eye" the effect of "Trick Mirror" instead. As a result the effects of the "Aesirs" are negated. Halldor then tries to attack with "Odin", but Yusei uses the effect of "Shooting Star Dragon" to remove his monster from play and negate the attack. Halldor doesn't care as Yusei's only monster is gone now so he prepares to attack with "Thor" or "Loki". Yusei smiles and activates " Zero Force " to reduce the ATK of all of Halldor's monsters to 0. Halldor becomes shocked at what Yusei has just done and realizes he can no longer use his "Aesirs" for attacking. The final effect of " Gjallarhorn " then activates, removing all three "Aesirs" from play and inflicting their total ATK to Yusei as damage, however since they had 0 ATK when this occurred, Yusei takes no damage. Halldor is even more shocked that Yusei outsmarted his tactics and  Dragan  is angered that the gods were defeated. Jack notes now that the "Aesirs" have been removed from play, Halldor can't use their effects to revive them. Yusei's "Shooting Star Dragon" then comes back due to its effect and Yusei immediately has it attack Halldor directly and win the Duel, which frustrates Dragan and  Broder  greatly as Halldor and Yusei come back.
 
 Featured Duel: Yusei Fudo vs. Halldor 
 ...continued from previous episode. 
 Turn 20: Halldor 
Halldor has just activated " Gjallarhorn " in response to Yusei activating " Wave Rebound " to negate the Summons of the " Aesirs " and inflict their combined ATK as damage to Halldor. Due to the first effect of "Gjallarhorn", the Special Summoning of the "Aesirs" can't be negated this turn, so "Wave Rebound" resolves without effect. Halldor explains that during his third End Phase after the activation of "Gjallarhorn", its second effect will remove itself and the three "Aesirs" from play and inflict damage to Yusei equal to the combined ATK of all three. Halldor's hand contains " Birthright " and " Soul Resurrection ".
 " Thor, Lord of the Aesir " ( 10/3500/2800), " Loki, Lord of the Aesir " ( 10/3300/3000), and " Odin, Father of the Aesir " ( 10/4000/3500) are all revived in Attack Position via their own effects. The secondary last effects of the "Aesirs" then activate. The final effect of "Thor, Lord of the Aesir" resolves first (Yusei 2000 → 1200). "Loki, Lord of the Aesir" allows Halldor to add " Odin's Eye " from his Graveyard to his hand. Finally, the effect of "Odin, Father of the Aesir" allows Halldor to draw a card (" Miraculous Descent "). On Halldor's End Phase, Yusei is forced to remove the last  Chain Counter  on " Monster Chain " (Chain Counters: 1 → 0). Since "Monster Chain" has no more Chain Counters, it is destroyed.
 Turn 21: Yusei Fudo  
Yusei draws "Stardust Phantom". During the Standby Phase, the effect of " Speed World 2 " activates (Yusei's SPC: 1 → 2; Halldor's SPC: 8 → 9). Yusei then Normal Summons " Stardust Phantom " ( 1/0/0) in Defense Position and sets a card.
 Turn 22: Halldor  
Halldor draws. During the Standby Phase, the effect of "Speed World 2" activates (Yusei's SPC: 2 → 3; Halldor's SPC: 9 → 10). Halldor then activates the effect of "Speed World 2" to remove ten  Speed Counters  (Halldor's SPC: 10 → 0) and destroy Yusei's "Stardust Phantom". Yusei activates the effect of "Stardust Phantom" to revive " Stardust Dragon " ( 8/2500/2000) in  Defense Position . 
 "Thor, Lord of the Aesir" attacks "Stardust Dragon", but Yusei  removes from play  "Stardust Phantom" from his Graveyard in order to grant "Stardust Dragon" the ability to avoid being destroyed in battle by reducing its  ATK  and  DEF  by 800. Yusei activates the "Stardust Phantom"-granted effect of "Stardust Dragon" in order to prevent its destruction ("Stardust Dragon": 2500 → 1700/2000 → 1200). "Loki, Lord of the Aesir" attacks "Stardust Dragon", but Yusei activates the "Stardust Phantom"-granted effect of "Stardust Dragon" in order to prevent its destruction ("Stardust Dragon": 1700 → 900/1200 → 400). Halldor's hand contains "Jormungand the Nordic Serpent", "Miraculous Descent", "Soul Resurrection", "Odin's Eye", and "Birthright". 
 "Odin, Father of the Aesir" attacks "Stardust Dragon", but Yusei sends " Stronghold Guardian " from his hand to the Graveyard in order to increase the DEF of "Stardust Dragon" by 1500 ("Stardust Dragon": 1000/400 → 1900). Yusei then activates the "Stardust Phantom"-granted effect of "Stardust Dragon" in order to prevent its destruction ("Stardust Dragon": 1000 → 200/1900 → 1100). 
 Halldor then Special Summons " Jormungardr the Nordic Serpent " ( 8/3000/3000) to Yusei's side of the field in Defense Position via its own effect (as Halldor controls a  Divine-Beast - Type  monster). When "Jormungardr" is switched from Defense Position to Attack Position, Yusei will take 3000 damage. Halldor then activates his face-down " Gleipnir, the Fetters of Fenrir " to add "Fenrir the Nordic Wolf" from his Deck to his hand. He then Special Summons " Fenrir the Nordic Wolf " ( 10/4000/4000) to Yusei's side of the field in Defense Position via its own effect (as Halldor controls a face-up Divine-Beast-Type monster). While "Fenrir the Nordic Wolf" is face-up, all Defense Position monsters will be switched to Attack Position during the Battle Phase. Also any Battle Damage that a player takes involving "Fenrir the Nordic Wolf" will be dealt to their opponent too. Halldor Sets a card. On Halldor's End Phase, the effect of "Stronghold Guardian" expires ("Stardust Dragon": 200/1100 → 0).
 Turn 23: Yusei Fudo  
Yusei draws "Speed Spell - Star Force". During the Standby Phase, the effect of "Speed World 2" activates (Yusei's SPC: 3 → 4; Halldor's SPC: 0 → 1). Yusei then activates his face-down " Hope for Escape " to pay 1000  Life Points  (Yusei 1200 → 200) and draw one card for each 1000 points of difference between his and Halldor's Life Points. The difference between Yusei and Halldor's Life Points is at least 3000 and less than 4000, so Yusei draws three cards. Yusei then  Normal Summons  " Life Gardna " ( 1/0/800) in Attack Position. He then  removes from play  "Jormungardr the Nordic Serpent" in order to  Special Summon  " D.D. Sprite " ( 1/0/100) in Attack Position. Yusei then tunes "Life Gardna" with "D.D. Sprite" in order to  Synchro Summon  " Formula Synchron " ( 2/200/1500) in Attack Position. Since "Life Gardna" was sent to the Graveyard, its effect activates, increasing Yusei's  Life Points  by 800 (Yusei 200 → 1000).
 Yusei's hand contains "Trick Mirror" and "Speed Spell - Star Force". Yusei then activates the effect of "Formula Synchron" to draw one card ("Zero Force"). Yusei then tunes "Stardust Dragon" with "Formula Synchron] in order to  Accel Synchro Summon  " Shooting Star Dragon " ( 10/3300/2500) in Attack Position. 
 Yusei then activates " Speed Spell - Star Force " to remove "Fenrir the Nordic Wolf" from play and increase the ATK of "Shooting Star Dragon" by the Level of "Fenrir the Nordic Wolf" times 100. "Fenrir the Nordic Wolf" is Level 10 ("Shooting Star Dragon": 3300 → 4300/2500). Yusei then activates the first effect of "Shooting Star Dragon" to reveal the top five cards of his Deck and allow "Shooting Star Dragon" one attack for each  Tuner Monster  he finds. Yusei finds " Junk Synchron ", " Nitro Synchron ", " Turbo Synchron ", " Sonic Chick ", and " Scrap-Iron Scarecrow ", so "Shooting Star Dragon" gains three attacks.
 "Shooting Star Dragon" attacks and destroys "Thor, Lord of the Aesir", "Loki, Lord of the Aesir", and "Odin, Father of the Aesir" (Halldor 4000 → 3200 → 2200 → 1900). Yusei Sets two cards. On Yusei's End Phase, the effect of "Speed Spell - Star Force" expires ("Shooting Star Dragon": 4300 → 3300/2500). At the same time, "Thor, Lord of the Aesir" ( 10/3500/2800), "Loki, Lord of the Aesir" ( 10/3300/3000), and "Odin, Father of the Aesir" ( 10/4000/3500) are all revived in Attack Position via their own effects. The secondary last effects of the Aesirs then activate. The final effect of "Thor" resolves first (Yusei 1000 → 200), the final effect of "Loki" allows Halldor to add "Gleipnir, the Fetters of Fenrir" from his Deck to his hand, and the final effect of "Odin" allows Halldor to draw a card.
 Turn 24: Halldor  
Halldor draws. During the Standby Phase, the effect of "Speed World 2" activates (Yusei's SPC: 4 → 5; Halldor's SPC: 1 → 2). Halldor's hand contains "Tyr of the Nordic Champions", "Birthright", "Soul Resurrection", "Miraculous Descent", " Wall of Revealing Light ", and "Gleipnir, the Fetters of Fenrir". 
 Halldor then  Normal Summons  " Tyr of the Nordic Champions " ( 4/2000/2000) in Attack Position. Halldor then activates his face-down "Odin's Eye" and Tributes "Tyr of the Nordic Champions" to prevent the "Aesirs" from having their effects negated by his card effects this turn. Before Halldor can activate the effect of "Odin's Eye" to see what one of Yusei's Set cards is, Yusei activates his face-down " Trick Mirror " to activate the effect of "Odin's Eye" as the effect of "Trick Mirror" instead (since this has the effect of the effect of "Odin's Eye" shift sides rather than outright stopping the effect of "Odin's Eye", the card is not being  negated , so "Odin's Eye" cannot stop the effect of "Trick Mirror"), which means the effects of the "Aesirs" are negated and Halldor must show all cards he currently has in his hand to Yusei; this wasn't shown as it wasn't relevant to Yusei's plan.
 "Odin, Father of the Aesir" attacks "Shooting Star Dragon", but Yusei activates the third effect of "Shooting Star Dragon" to remove it from play and negate the attack. Halldor prepares to attack directly with "Thor" or "Loki", but Yusei activates his face-down " Zero Force " to reduce the  ATK  and  DEF  of all monsters on the field that had equal or higher ATK than "Shooting Star Dragon" to 0 ("Thor": 3500 → 0/2800 → 0) ("Loki": 3300 → 0/3000 → 0) ("Odin": 4000 → 0/3500 → 0). On Halldor's End Phase, the final effect of "Gjallarhorn" activates, removing itself and the " Aesirs " from play, but Yusei takes no damage. "Shooting Star Dragon" then returns to the field ( 10/3300/2500) in Attack Position.
 Turn 25: Yusei Fudo  
Yusei draws. During the Standby Phase, the effect of "Speed World 2" activates (Yusei's SPC: 5 → 6; Halldor's SPC: 2 → 3). "Shooting Star Dragon" attacks directly (Halldor 1900 → 0).
 
 Mistakes 
 When Yusei's Life Points decreased to pay the cost of " Hope for Escape ", no sound effect was played. This was fixed on the DVD release. 
 When Synchro Summoning " Formula Synchron ", he declares that he is Tuning " D.D. Sprite " to " Life Gardna ", making "D. D. Sprite" the Tuner (a fact supported by the card's  OCG  form being a Tuner). However, it is "Life Gardna" that becomes a green Synchro ring, which is what the Tuner monster is supposed to do. 
 When Yusei declared a direct attack during his last turn, his  Duel Runner  was gone. 
 In the English version, " Majestic Star Dragon " was shown instead of " Stardust Dragon " when  Halldor  attacked with " Odin, Father of the Aesir ". A second time, " Shooting Star Dragon " was shown instead, right before its actual Summon later on. 
 In the English version, before Halldor declared Odin's attack on "Stardust Dragon", a small glimpse shows " Wise Core " in his hand. 
 In the English version, Yusei states that " Stronghold Guardian " is banished, instead of discarded. 
 When Halldor retrieves " Gleipnir, the Fetters of Fenrir " via the effect of " Loki, Lord of the Aesir ", he calls it by its Japanese translated name. 
 Trivia 
 This episode could be a tribute or reference to the original  Egyptian God  cards, " Obelisk the Tormentor ", " Slifer the Sky Dragon ", and " The Winged Dragon of Ra ".
 When " Shooting Star Dragon " attacks with its effect, it splits into three separate colors: blue (Obelisk), red (Slifer), and yellow (Ra). 
 When each of the Nordic Gods gets destroyed by "Shooting Star Dragon", the order of the attacks matches as well: blue destroyed "Thor" ("Obelisk"), red destroyed "Loki" ("Slifer"), and yellow destroyed "Odin" ("Ra"). This ordering of both trios is generally seen as both trios' respective power levels. 
 Differences in Adaptations 
 Like  Episode 109  and  Episode 110 , the song  Clear Mind  is replaced with standard music in the dub version. 
 In the original, the attack of " Shooting Star Dragon " sliced "Loki" in half. This is not shown in the dub.
