 Pendulum Monster  (Japanese: ペンデュラムモンスター  Pendyuramu Monsutā ; usually abbreviated  Ｐ モンスター), also called a  Pendulum Card  in the early episodes of the  Yu-Gi-Oh! ARC-V  anime, is a type of  Monster Card  that is half green. They first appeared in the  Yu-Gi-Oh! ARC-V  anime, and were introduced to the  OCG  and  TCG  in  Starter Deck 2014  and  Super Starter: Space-Time Showdown  respectively.
 In addition to normal usages as Monster Cards, a Pendulum Monster can also be  activated  from the  hand  as a  Spell Card  in a  Pendulum Zone ; if there are Pendulum Monsters in both Pendulum Zones, the player can perform a  Pendulum Summon . [1] [2] [3] 
 So far,  Normal ,  Effect ,  Ritual ,  Fusion ,  Synchro  and  Xyz  Pendulum Monsters have been seen. Pendulum Monsters can also be  Tuner ,  Flip  and  Spirit monsters .

 Mechanics 
 A Pendulum Monster can be used in two ways: either as a Monster card (that can be Summoned), or as a  Spell Card  by activating it in the  Pendulum Zone .
 If a Pendulum Monster card (even if  face-down ) would be  sent  from the  field  to the  GY  (either as a Monster Card or Spell Card), it is placed face-up in the  Extra Deck  instead. This can cause the total size of the Extra Deck to be larger than would be allowed during Deck building. A Pendulum Monster is sent to the Graveyard like normal if it is sent from any location other than the field (including if it has its  activation  as a  Spell Card  or  Summon   negated ). [1] [2] [3]  If a card effect causes cards to not go to the GY (" Macro Cosmos " or " Grave Protector "), this will override the Pendulum Monster's mechanic to go to the Extra Deck, and instead would be moved to the zones designated by such effects (or  banished ).  [1] [2] [3] 
 Pendulum Monsters cannot be used to pay  costs  that require  sending  cards from the field to the Graveyard, as they would not be able to go to the Graveyard but would be placed in the Extra Deck instead; however, they can still be  Tributed  for costs and used as Materials for Summons. They can otherwise be sent from the hand or Deck to the GY.
 
 As a Monster Card 
 While not in a Pendulum Zone, a Pendulum Monster is treated as a Monster Card, and its  monster effects  are applied. It can be Special Summoned by appropriate card effects. If it is also a Normal or Effect Monster, it can also be Normal Summoned/Set from the hand, just like any other Normal or Effect Monster.
 
 As a Spell Card 
 Main article:  Pendulum Zone 
 A Pendulum Monster card can be activated from the hand as a Spell Card in the player's unoccupied  Pendulum Zone  (cannot be  Set  in the Pendulum Zone). Upon  resolving , it remains  face-up  in the Pendulum Zone as a Spell Card, its  Pendulum Scale  is active, and  Pendulum Effects , if any, apply. Pendulum Monster cards in the Pendulum Zone are not treated as Monster, and their  monster effects  are not applied at this time.
 Although a Pendulum Monster is treated as a Spell Card while in the Pendulum Zone, it is not considered a  Normal ,  Continuous ,  Field ,  Equip ,  Quick-Play , or  Ritual Spell Card . As long as there is an available Pendulum Zone on the player's field, they can activate a Pendulum Monster from their hand in that zone. Unlike Field Spells, players cannot send cards in the Pendulum Zone to face-up Extra Deck to activate a new one.  [1] [2] [3] 
 
 Pendulum Summon 
 Main article:  Pendulum Summon 
 Once per turn, during the  Main Phase , while there are Pendulum Monsters in both Pendulum Zones, the  turn player  can perform a  Pendulum Summon , Special Summoning multiple Monsters from their  hand  as well as Pendulum Monsters that are face-up in the Extra Deck at the same time, using the Pendulum Monsters'  Pendulum Scales  to determine the Levels of the monsters that can be Summoned. [1] [2] [3] 
 
 Extra Deck Pendulum Monsters 
 See also:  Fusion Pendulum Monster ,  Synchro Pendulum Monster , and  Xyz Pendulum Monster 
 While most Pendulum Monsters are also Normal or Effect Monsters and put in the Main Deck), a small number of Pendulum Monsters are also  Fusion ,  Synchro , or  Xyz Monsters . These cards are put  face-down  in the Extra Deck, and can be  Fusion ,  Synchro  or  Xyz Summoned  (depending on their monster card type) as normal while face-down.
 When they are sent to the GY from field, they will be put back in the Extra Deck face-up. Face-up Pendulum Monsters in the Extra Deck can be Pendulum Summoned, provided they were properly Summoned by their mechanics from face-down first, but they can no longer be Fusion, Synchro or Xyz Summoned, or Special Summoned by an effect that is treated as such Summons. If they are returned to the hand, Deck or Extra Deck, they will be returned face-down as with all ofther Extra Deck monsters.
 Because they are Extra Deck monsters, they cannot be activated to the Pendulum Zone from the hand. Rather, they have effects to place themselves in the Pendulum Zone.
 As Xyz Monsters do not have Levels,  Xyz Pendulum Monsters  use the Level written in the condition, if any. [4] 
 
 Card layout 
 As the Pendulum Effects and the Pendulum Scales take up the space where the  Set Number  would usually be placed, the Set Number is placed in the bottom left corner of the card instead, in the same line as the  ATK / DEF  values of the Pendulum Monster. The art frame of a Pendulum Monster is increased in size, to the same width as the Effect boxes, and the Pendulum Effect box is partially transparent, allowing the art to be seen beneath it. The upper bit of the Effect box (more or less corresponding to the Type line's height) is also transparent, but to a lesser degree than the Pendulum Effect box.
 
 Playing style 
 A good Pendulum-based Deck has the ability to do what the anime calls "going beyond the Pendulum", which involves using Pendulum Summoning to gather  Materials  for a  Fusion ,  Synchro ,  Xyz  or  Link Summon , as  Tributes  for a  Tribute  or  Ritual Summon , or to activate multiple effects that activate when Summoned (possibly using  SEGOC  to prevent the important one of being negated).
 Pendulum Monsters' main weakness is their hand advantage cost to place in the Pendulum Zone, causing them to be vulnerable to  nuke  effects as they will destroy the field and shut down Pendulum Decks until a Pendulum Scale can be restored. Furthermore, cards like " Hand Destruction " and " Solemn Warning " that can cause the Pendulum Monsters to be sent to the Graveyard can be problematic as well, since most Pendulum Monster Decks don't have ways to get cards back from the Graveyard, though you can remedy this with cards like " Pot of Riches " or " Pendulum Reborn ".
 Cards that  banish  (like " Divine Knight Ishzark " and " Chaos Sorcerer "), specifically counter Spell Cards (like " Spell Canceller "), and deplete the  Extra Deck  (like " Zaborg the Mega Monarch " and " Extra Gate ") are problems for Pendulum Decks. " Anti-Spell Fragrance " will also prevent Pendulum Monsters being placed in the Pendulum Zone at all, since cards cannot be Set in the Pendulum Zone. " Pot of Acquisitiveness ", Spell & Trap removal (preferably  Quick-Play , such as " Mystical Space Typhoon ") and " Imperial Iron Wall " can deal with these cards, however.
 Pendulum-based Decks also require that you either open with a sufficient amount of monsters or with the ability to search for them. If you don't open with enough monsters, Pendulum Summoning doesn't provide much of an advantage.
 
 Lore 
 In the anime, Pendulum Monsters were created when  Z-ARC  and  Ray Akaba 's wills reacted to each other when the  world  was split into four during their duel.  Yuya 's Pendulum Monsters were originally Effect Monsters, but they were transformed by the power of  Yuya's pendant  into their current state when Z-ARC awakened for the first time. After Yuya's initial discovery of Pendulum Monsters,  Declan Akaba  started a project within the  Leo Corporation  to create more Pendulum Monsters so that the entire world can have access to them. The first prototypes were unveiled in Declan's first duel with Yuya, but the summoning energy they gave off was unstable and so they malfunctioned. Also, these initial prototypes couldn't quite match Yuya's Pendulum Summon in terms of energy. Although they managed to stabilize their Pendulum Monsters' energy in time for the  Arc League Championship , it was never directly stated whether or not the finished Pendulum Monsters were as good as Yuya's.  Leo Akaba  later used Pendulum Monsters of his own, though it is unknown where, how, or when he obtained them.
 When a Pendulum Monster is placed into a Pendulum Zone, it appears in a transparent column of blue light from a portal on the ground not dissimilar to the Summoning of monsters in  Yu-Gi-Oh! 5D's .
 In the anime, when a Duelist uses Pendulum Summoning to gather the materials required for a  Fusion ,  Synchro , or  Xyz Summon , it is referred to as performing a "Pendulum-Fusion", "Pendulum-Synchro", or "Pendulum-Xyz Summon", respectively. A Pendulum Monster that is also a Fusion, Synchro, or Xyz Monster is referred to as a "Fusion-Pendulum", "Synchro-Pendulum", or "Xyz-Pendulum Monster", respectively.

 Trivia 
 So far, no Pendulum Monster has more than 4000 ATK and 4000 DEF. 
 " Qliphort Scout " was the first Pendulum Monster to ever be on the Forbidden/Limited Lists.
 " Performage Plushfire " was the first Pendulum Monster to ever be  Forbidden . 
 Unlike the other Monster Card types, there are no Pendulum Monsters that are not also members of at least one other Monster Card type. 
 So far, there are no  Link  Pendulum Monsters. 
 This is the only Monster Card type that can exist in both the Main Deck and the Extra Deck.
