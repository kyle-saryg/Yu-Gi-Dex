      The shrine.     
 The  Earthbound Immortal Shrine  was built following the  events  of the  Dark Signers .
 
 History 
 After the  Signers  and  Dark Signers  battle, the Earthbound Immortals were sealed once again on the  Nazca Lines ,  Greiger  and his siblings constructed this shrine to pacify the Evil gods and to prevent them from being reawakened. [1] 
 
       Quetzalcoatl carved on the shrine.     
 Greiger also carved an image of  Quetzalcoatl  on top of the shrine, believing that this God could protect the shrine. [1] 
 
       The hidden chamber.     
 Yusei Fudo  and  Jack Atlas  came here, while visiting  Greiger , who had a dream of Jack dying. [1]  The  Familiar of Red Nova  met Jack at a nearby village and told him to come to the Shrine to receive power. Jack went to the top of the Shrine and following a lightning strike, a hole was broken at the top, giving him access to a hidden chamber that was not there when Greiger built the structure. Inside Jack faced the Familiar in a  ritual Duel , where if Jack won he would get power and if he lost his body would be given to the  Crimson Devil . [2] 
 Towards the end of the ritual Duel, Red Nova appeared wanting to take Jack. However the  Crimson Dragon  emerged from Quetzalcoatl's tablet to protect Jack. Jack used  Blazing Soul  to seal Red Nova into a card and merge it with " Red Dragon Archfiend " in a  Double Tuning  to form " Red Nova Dragon ". [3] 
 After Jack defeated the Familiar, the shrine came crumbling down around Jack, Yusei, Greiger and Max. However the four of them were protected by the Crimson Dragon. The shrine was destroyed completely, although the tablet was left intact. [3]
