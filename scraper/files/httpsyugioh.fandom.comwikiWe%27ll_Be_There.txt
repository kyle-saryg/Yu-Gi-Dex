 Lyrics 
 
 Téa : Everyone, put your hands together and I'll mark us with a special sign. 
 Yugi  &  Tristan : Huh? 
 Joey : What gives Tea? 
 Téa : It's a symbol of our friendship--so when Yugi's Dueling, no matter how tough it gets, he'll know that he's not alone. 
 
Think of us and we'll be there, 
In your heart forever. 
Sometimes when you're unsure, 
Sometimes when you're afraid. 
 
At times its hard to live, 
With the choices you have made. 
Turn around and we'll be there, 
Always by your side. 
 
When its time to stand the test, 
I know you'll shine above the rest. 
When you try and find your way, 
We'll be there... 
 
(We'll be there...) 
 
Hold out your hand 
A promise to be true, 
Will make us always a part of you... 
 
When it's time to stand the test, 
I know you'll shine above the rest. 
When you try and find your way, 
We'll be there... 
 
(We'll be there...) 
 
We'll stick together through thick and thin, 
That's the meaning of a real friend. 
And when it's time to stand the test, (Oh, we'll be there!) 
Friendship shines above the rest. 
 
(And if you're feeling down, we'll be there!) 
 
Stick together through thick and thin, 
(Let's work together now) 
That's the meaning of a real friend. (And if you're feeling down, we'll be there!) 
And when it's time to stand the test, (And you can bring a friend, we'll be there!) 
Friendship shines above the rest. 
 
We'll stick together through thick and thin, (oh, we'll be there!) 
That's the meaning of a real friend. (Ooooh!) 
And when it's time to stand the test, (We'll be there!) 
Friendship shines above the rest. 
 
Stick together through thick and thin 
(fadeout)
