 " Rank-Up-Magic " ( ＲＵＭ   Rankuappu Majikku ) is an  archetype  of  Spell Cards  introduced in the  Yu-Gi-Oh! ZEXAL  anime. Their  effects  allow one to  Rank-Up  an  Xyz Monster  for an Xyz Monster with a  Rank  higher than the  target  is then  Special Summoned  from the  Extra Deck , with the targeted Xyz Monster and its  Xyz Materials  both becoming Xyz Materials on the newly Summoned  monster . This process is called " Xyz Evolution ".
 In the Japanese version of the anime, whenever a Duelist declares the activation of a "Rank-Up-Magic" card, they do not say the phrase "I activate the Spell Card..." However, if the card is not a  Normal Spell Card , they declare the card's  property .
 
 Story 
 ZEXAL 
 The Rank-Up-Magic cards were first introduced in the anime by  Girag , who used " Rank-Up-Magic Barian's Force " to brainwash residents of  Heartland  in order to take the " Numbers " from  Yuma ,  Astral  and  Shark . Each time it would be used to Rank-Up Xyz Monsters into " CXyz " monsters in order to overpower the "Numbers".  Mizar  used it next when he himself ranked up his " Number 107: Galaxy-Eyes Tachyon Dragon " in order to form its Chaos form. This monster wasn't fully revealed as the  Sphere Field  collapsed from its power.  Alito  and Girag both ranked up their respective " Number 10X " monsters. Both of them were defeated by Yuma and Astral (Girag was also defeated by  Vector  posing as Ray). In the same Duel where Girag was defeated, Yuma gained his own Rank-Up-Magic card in the form of " Limited Barian's Force " during his Duel with Girag from "Ray" but was later transformed into " Numeron Force " by  ZEXAL II . Vector also demonstrated his mastery of Rank-Up-Magic cards when he used "Rank-Up-Magic Barian's Force" on his "Number 10X" monster, and also to brainwash  Brooke Walker .
 When Yuma went to the  Astral World  looking for Astral, he Dueled against  Eliphas  who used " Rank-Up-Magic Astral Force " in his Duel against Yuma, resulting in the first appearance of "Rank-Up Xyz Evolution".
 Vetrix  and  Quinton  researched the Barian World and managed to create " Rank-Up-Magic Argent Chaos Force ". Due to it being reverse engineered from the Barian cards, its effect is weaker, only Ranking Up the monster and doing nothing else.  Quattro ,  Trey  and  Quinton  would go on to use this card against the  Seven Barian Emperors .
 When Shark became  Nash  (his Barian alter-ego) once again he augmented the  Barian Emperors  with the Spell Card " Rank-Up-Magic - The Seventh One " which worked specifically for their "Number 10X" monsters and was used by all the Emperors except Vector. They still retained the original "Barian's Force", and Alito used it to Summon " Number C80: Requiem in Berserk ". Vector gained a new "Rank-Up-Magic" card during his Duel against Nash in  Episode 137 : " Admiration of the Thousands ". During the same Duel Nash also demonstrated a new "Rank-Up-Magic" card: " Quick Chaos ", the first "Rank-Up-Magic"  Quick-Play Spell Card .
 Astral's final Duel against Yuma revealed him to possess three "Rank-Up-Magic" cards: " (Double-) Utopia Force ", " Dark Force ", and " (Hyper-) Ultimate Force ".
 In the  ZEXAL  manga ,  Yuma  obtained " Rank-Up-Magic Shining Force " during his second Duel against  Kaito .
 
 ARC-V 
 In the  ARC-V  anime, four Duelists possess the following amount of "Rank-Up-Magic" cards:
 
 Shay Obsidian  - 10 (" Raptor's Force ", " Revolution Force ", " Raid Force ", " Doom Double Force ", " Soul Shave Force ", " Skip Force ", " Escape Force ", " Devotion Force ", " Limitover Force ", and " Battle Up Force ") 
 Yuya Sakaki / Yuto  - 2 (" The Phantom Knights' Launch " and " The Phantom Knights' Burial ") 
 Kite Tenjo  - 4 (" Cipher Ascension ", " Cipher Pursuit ", " Cipher Shock ", and "Limitover Force") 
 Dennis McField  - 1 (" Magical Force ") 
 "Rank-Up-Magic" cards are implied to not exist in the  Standard Dimension , as  Dipper O'rion  has stated that  LID  doesn't instruct people in their use.
