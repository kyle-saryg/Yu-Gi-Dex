 Biography 
 Prior to pilot 
 When 3-year-old Luna entered the  Duel Monsters Spirit World , Kuribon befriended her. [1] 
 
 Fortune Cup 
 Eight years after her first visit, Luna was sent to the spirit world. Here she met up with Kuribon, who assists in finding  Ancient Fairy Dragon , who is sealed in stone and helps her remember the promise she made to protect the spirits. [2] [1] 
 The moves in Luna and  Frank's  Duel in the human world dictated what happened to the spirits. So " Gestalt Trap " was strapped to Kuribon, who was also affected by " Immortal Homeostasis ". Kuribon was attacked by  Ido . Kuribon was able to survive the attacks, but suffered pain, which Frank described as the "pain of immortality". The second time it was attacked, Luna managed to save Kuribon using " Fairy Wind " to free her from Frank's cards. [2] [1] 
 While  Yusei  dueled  Akiza  in the  Fortune Cup , Kuribon appeared alongside Luna to express concern over the Duel. [3] 
 
 Dark Signers 
 While the  Signers  and their companions pursued the  Dark Signers , Kuribon appeared to Luna and told her there was trouble in the spirits' world. Luna's body and mind were transported to the spirits' world. [4] [5] 
 She and Kuribon went to the town,  Schwank , where they were hunted by  Zeman's   monkey troop . Kuribon, along with the spirits of some of Luna's other cards distract the troop to allow Luna to escape. The monkeys cast a  Minus Curse  on the spirits, turning them into stone slabs of  Duel Monsters  cards with  Negative Levels . [5] 
 When Luna enters  Zeman's castle , she hears Kuribon cry from her slab. [6] . Kuribon is freed after Luna and  Leo  defeat  Devack .
 After the  King of the Netherworld  is released into Satellite, Kuribon appears next to Luna to tell her not to let it get to the Condor  geoglyph . [7]
