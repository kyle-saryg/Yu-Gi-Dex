 Admire Derby  (アドマイヤ・ダービー, Adomaiya Dābī) is a character appearing within the  Yu-Gi-Oh! 5D's  manga  and a contestant in the  D1GP , having reached the tournament's second stage. [1] 
 An omake from the tankōbon  volume 5  revealed that Admire Dueled against  Tetsu Trudge  and won, obtaining the Level 8 Star Ticket. He also defeated  Adolf Mueller  to obtain the Level 3 Star Ticket, shown to be claiming that he'd leave Mueller in the dust during the Duel. 
 He later is shown to have obtained the Level 3, 5, 8 and 9  Star Tickets , (over double the required minimum of twelve) and he was the first Duelist to advance to the final stage of the tournament by passing through the  Duel Gate , passing through a smaller door. Upon doing so, his scream of anguish was heard. [2]  It was later shown that he'd been imprisoned in a card by  Lazar , implying that he'd been defeated by him in a Duel.
