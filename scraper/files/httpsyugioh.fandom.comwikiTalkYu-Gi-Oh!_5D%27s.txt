 Five Duel Scoop 
 Any proof that it is called "5 duel scoop"? Seems like vandalism to me, compared to "5 Dragons".  Yami Michael  08:28, 13 March 2008 (UTC)
 
 I thought it was Five Duel Scoop because Familiar Stranger said that it was, but it turns out he was wrong and it's possibly Five Dragons.  Mizumaru  20:03, 18 March 2008 (UTC) 
 I have proof of Yu-Gi-Oh! Five Duel Scoop. Kinda.

 V-Jump stated it was "Five-Duel Scoop".-- TwoTailedFox  ( My Talk Page ) 16:11, 20 March 2008 (UTC) 
 It's just basic assumption based on lack of knowledge of the property in general, probably. That rumor about the name being that (when it was just the name of a feature in V-Jump) must have spread farther than we thought. 5D's stands for "Five Ds."  Mizumaru  19:33, 20 March 2008 (UTC) 
 Okay nothing is truly verified until the show airs, I say take the whole "Five-Duel Scoop" down and just leave it with Yugioh! 5Ds till we know anything for sure  134.121.250.173  17:09, 26 March 2008 (UTC)
 lmao you guys actually believe its called "Five-Duel Scoop" lol wow you guys are in for a surprise then.  Anzo12  19:52, 29 March 2008 (UTC)
 
 We're going by the V-Jump wording, when the Dub comes out, we'll use that name.-- TwoTailedFox  ( My Talk Page ) 19:56, 29 March 2008 (UTC) 
 I've read V-Jump and no where do I see it says that "Five Duel-Scoop" is the title. I saw a promotion where it lists 5 scoops about Yugioh 5D's  http://duelevolution.wordpress.com/2008/02/18/yu-gi-oh-online-news-from-v-jump-42008/ . That's about it. But since I dont really mind what's written here, I agree it can wait till the show premiers.  Anzo12  23:55, 29 March 2008 (UTC)
 i believe that it is called "5 dragon's" because from watching the show  it makes a whole lot more sense than "5 duel scoop".  also if you would like to see "5 dragon's" the first five episodes are subtitled up on the veoh network (veoh.com).  for fair warning to those who might not like this kind of stuff   it is in Japanese with  good  voiceovers instead of the crappy 4kids dubbing that will be coming.  it is subtitled in english.  if you cannot find it there than it is on "zone-anime.com" also subtitled.  Death705  08:23, 11 May 2008 (UTC)
 
 There is no solid evidence taht 5D's stands for Five Dragons. There are sources to say it stands for Five Duel Scoop. Regardless of if it's just a dub title or not it's the only one that's been announced. If it's ever announced that it satnds for 5 dragons we'll include both. People changing it to 5 Dragons because it sounds cooler to them is why the page has been protected. --  Deltaneos  12:15, 11 May 2008 (UTC) 
 while you are right that there is no solid evidence for "5dragons" there actually is almost no evidence at all let alone solid evidence for "5 duel scoop". i make my assumption based on what makes more sense while watching the show. i checked out everywhere you guys here said that it stated that and did a little more digging and found that "5 duel scoop is just a misunderstanding of a couple articles.  never once did they say it was the name of the show Death705  15:01, 11 May 2008 (UTC)
 
 "5 Duel Scoop" comes from V-Jump Magazine. Whatever the Dub name is, we'll use that primarily, so sit down, chill out, and wait.-- TwoTailedFox  ( My Talk Page ) 15:05, 11 May 2008 (UTC) 
 i think i found out where all this confusion is coming from   from what i read earlier today the actual title in Japan is 5 dragons but from anyone who has watched anything from 4kids tv  they tend to butcher anime horribly  and since it was 4kids that licensed this show they changed the name to 5 duel scoop for the American version of the show.  so from saying that  i think that both are correct and at the same time both are wrong depending on which version you watch  either the japanese or the english version.   and by the way  i have actually seen the show in japanese   i know what it is about so i don't know why you are waiting for the horrible english dubbing but if that's what you prefer than  to each their own. Death705  17:06, 11 May 2008 (UTC)
 
 V-Jump Stated the name was "5 Duel Scoop", how many times must I keep repeating this? Page is now locked.-- TwoTailedFox  ( My Talk Page ) 17:42, 11 May 2008 (UTC) 
 here is a quote from an article i read that explains the situation ""5D's" has been incorrectly quoted as standing for "5 Duel Scoop." V-Jump magazine printed a feature in their "Yu-Gi-Oh! Oukoku" (Yu-Gi-Oh! Kingdom) series which "5DS" (without the apostrophe) was labeled as "5 Duel Scoop," which referred to the information within the feature itself. (As further stated by the article "Getting the Scoop on 5 Major News Flashes on New Dueling Developments." And listing each item as "DS1"-"DS5.")[4] Merchandise, television commercials, the logo itself, and other references all state the name as "Faibu Diizu". ICv2 News also has the name "5 Duel Scoop" listed in its 4Kids article." meaning you are correct, from what i got out of that the american(4kids/dubtitle) name is going to be "5 dual scoop" and it is true that i don't know what the japanese title is but i thought that you would like to see this, and again i am not trying to tell you that your wrong, like my last messege i am telling you that you are correct Death705  16:00, 7 June 2008 (UTC)
 
 We're aware, that's why the page has been unprotected. It is possible, the article about 4kids acquiring the series, made the same misinterpretation, so we not saying what it stands for, until we get a more definite source. --  Deltaneos  ( talk ) 17:26, 7 June 2008 (UTC) 
 Whats interesting is that several promotional materials for America seem to say it stands for "5 Duelists" (which would make sense because of the five signers). The commercials for the Collectors Tins 2008 said "5 Duelists", and the 4kids website, and the back of the card packs both mention 5 Duelists aswell in the context of describing the show. One of the potential theme songs for the English dub defined each "D" (keep in mind they were considering putting this on TV before EVERY episode). The commercials for the show mentioned "5 Dimensions". The franchise has never had an official answer for what 5Ds stands for, but I think it's sort of like the Nintendo DS, in that it never had an official statement as to what it stands for, because they could promote the acronym several ways. One could easily assume it stands for "5 Duelists" or "5 Dragons" because of the imagery given to them, just like one could assume that the "DS" stands for "Dual Screen". However, like the DS and Shigeru Miyamoto, there is probably an answer Kazuki Takahashi has in mind. Miyamoto said he would like us to think of the DS as "Developers System". Unline Miyamoto, Takahashi, nor the writers for the show have told us what they have in mind. A member of the writing staff literally stated that he wants us to "keep watching and find out".-- yugi-tan@live.com  07:20, 10 March 2009 (UTC)
 At first I had thought it was '5 dimensions' but I think 4kids confirmed somewhere it was 5 dragons  Qim1  19:40, 19 April 2009 (UTC)
 
 Yu-Gi-Oh! 5D's cutoff 
 I heard from some website that Yu-Gi-Oh! 5D's is probably going to have only 52 episodes in the series' run. This is most likely due to rating on the show not being very high, or that the story isn't really expanded all that much. Either way, I don't like it; it's nowhere near as long as the Yu-Gi-Oh! second series anime or Yu-Gi-Oh! GX!--  ChaosX97  (talk) 11:37, 11 October 2008 (UTC)
 
 That sounds like a mere rumour. --  Deltaneos  ( talk ) 04:08, 30 November 2008 (UTC) 
 I dunno, remember how popular the motorcycle arc was in the original yugioh? Still they haven't explained the fifth dragon yet have they? I don't really follow the series that well, it's nonsensical. 
 I'm sorry, I didn't realize the rest of Yu-Gi-Oh SUDDENLY MADE SENSE.  What a world.  Please tell me exactly what was explained in GX compared to what WASN'T, and let's not even get started on the almost infinite plotholes in the original series of the second anime (or the first series for that matter).  If you read the manga, it doesn't even come CLOSE to what was in there.   ShinobiPhoenix  02:25, April 19, 2010 (UTC)
 Acually you are all wrong, check the new episodes, (ep. 53- 130) -- XM345  ( talk  •  contribs ) 23:39, October 8, 2010 (UTC)
 
 Picture of Vol 6 found but cannot add. 
 I found the picture of the Vol 6 DVD at this website:  http://www.janime.info/5DS/media.html  but it won't allow me to save the picture so I can add it to this article.  Maybe someone else could find a way.
 
 Time? 
 Anyone have an idea what year this show is set?  I know it's supposed to be pretty far in the future, but have they ever given an exact date?  —This unsigned comment was made by  Rogueduelist89  ( talk  •  contribs ) 20:10, 28 February 2009 (UTC) 
 
 Some people believed it was set in the year 2021, because 2021 appeared on a neon light behind Yusei in the intro, but I wouldn't say it necessarily meant it was the year. --  Deltaneos  ( talk ) 21:00, 1 March 2009 (UTC) 
 I've heard it takes place 25 years after the original Yu-Gi-Oh! But that doesn't make sense, because GX took place 10 years after the original, meaning 5D's takes place 15 years after GX. But when Jaden went to Domino City, it was normal, while the Zero Reverse Effect took place 17 years before 5D's. So the 25 years thing is probably off. -- Riko  14:01, 4 March 2009 (UTC) 
 Could it be that you heard wrong and it's 25 years after GX?  —This unsigned comment was made by  75.107.104.245  ( talk  •  contribs ) 03:07, 23 May 2009 (UTC) 
 Yu-Gi-Oh! is supposed to be set in 1996 during the pilot. I think Yu-Gi-Oh! GX is said to be set around 2006. Hearing that 5D's is set 15 years after GX, comes from the (likely incorrect) assumption that 5D's is set in 2021 (see above). --  Deltaneos  ( talk ) 14:54, 23 May 2009 (UTC) 
 It has to be 2021, mean did anyone check that in the first seconds of the preview for next episode there appears a sign next to where the Masked D wheeler is. The Sign says "Dairy 2021".  DracoX  06:24, 27 August 2009 (UTC)
 
 Synchro Killer Arc? 
 What do fans currently call the current story arc?
 
I call this the repeat the same plot arc.-- Airbellum  04:24, 25 July 2009 (UTC)
 
 5ds third season 
 we need a new name besides "Third Arc" id vote for Yliaster arc or Infinty arc based on the three main villains or World grand Prix arc but third arc sounds terrible >_>-- RexGodwin  03:07, 5 August 2009 (UTC)
 
 the Third Arc is the 2nd Season not 3rd ~MEOW~ Might of the BIRD Empire~~  03:15, 5 August 2009 (UTC) 
 "Third arc" isn't its name, it's just what it is, so people shouldn't be capitalising the "t" and the "a" all the time. 
 I'll agree it would be good if we had something better to call it, but it's still too early to tell what the main focus of the arc will be. I think we should leave the section on this page as either "third arc" or "season 2". For subsections in character biographies, I'd be in favour of calling them after whatever is happening in that character's life. (e.g. World Grand Prix for Yusei, Jack and Crow, Duel Academy/Return to Duel Academy for the twins and Akiza.) 
 If we absolutly had to go with a name for the arc, I'd go with World Grand Prix, World Turbo Grand Prix or World Grand Prix. It looks like it's going to be the main setting (not sure how much of a guess that is). It seems favourable over Yliaster, since arcs tend to be named after the tournament, rather than the problems behind them. (e.g. Duelist Kingdom and Fortune Cup, rather than Pegasus and Signers.) --  Deltaneos  ( talk ) 10:35, 5 August 2009 (UTC) 
 very true, but wha about Dark Signers? and while we probably should wait, i have a fweling the WHOLE season won't be about the Grand Prix, just a good part whilst the Yliasters have been here since episode 65 (or at least the main three) and IIRC, it was NEVER stated officially either way if this is still the second or third season so i will continue to call it season 3
 From the´premiere event for today it looks more and more that this Arc will be the WRGP, though those from Yliaster having to do with the Grand Prix looks a little bit like Fortune Cup.  DracoX  06:28, 27 August 2009 (UTC)
 
 u.s. continuation 
 does anybody know if the english dub will continue? Soul reaper magnum  19:56, December 17, 2009 (UTC)
 
 On that subject, what will 4kids do about the deaths of all the dark signers? Remember family guy? "We aren't allowed to show death in school so instead, at the end we all dance around with sparklers". I can see 4kids doing that. 
 I think... The will be sent to the Shadow Realm like all the other bad guys in the english dub...
 Then, when they get revived, "Oh my, the power of the Crimson Dragon has brought back to us those sent to the shadow realm!"  Akyrix  15:11, December 29, 2009 (UTC)
 
Has the dub (for the third season) been released? As of last week, I heard that the dub wasn't coming out. Also, I noticed that  Placido  already had an English VA, despite the fact that 4kids has not announced the dubbing of the current season. -- DQ13 | Talk  Contribs  02:20, April 19, 2010 (UTC)
 
 I think you mean the second season. Episodes 1 to 64 are all season 1, according to the  4Kids episode listing . No episodes after 64 have been released in English as far as I know. I've removed the voice actor from the Placido page, until proof is given. --  Deltaneos  ( talk ) 21:26, April 19, 2010 (UTC) 
 Well, in the Japanese version it's season 3, or at least, Arc 3 (Fortune Cup, Dark Signer, and now WRPG/Infinity Arcs). And yeah, I was really wondering why there was an English VA for Placido in the first place. -- DQ13 | Talk  Contribs  00:47, April 20, 2010 (UTC) 
 my guess would be that there waiting to dub more episodes because japan is currently showing the third arc and that's where the dub last left off. Soul reaper magnum  20:03, April 20, 2010 (UTC)
 
 Well the current dubbed episode that haven't been released (aired) are on their website  [1] , but they recently announced that they will be continuing to air the new episodes. Of course, it is no where near the third arc yet.-- Qim1  23:26, June 3, 2010 (UTC) 
 Insert music 
 I noticed that there is no mention of the insert music "You Say - Towards Tommorow"(YOU SAY - 明日へ -), by La-Vie, the same band that composed "FREEDOM". It can be heard in episode 72, when Aki uses Stardust Dragon to stop a falling truck from landing on her, Yusei and Sherry. I think there were other times that this song was used, but I can't remember. In any case, I think it should be mentioned in the music section. Any objections? PoirotH  17:47, January 15, 2010 (UTC)
 
 Contact Yu-Gi-Oh 5d's staff and synchro music 
 Hello there, do anybody know I can contact people who are working on Yu-Gi-Oh 5d's anime to make feedbacks ? Thanks
 And, do you know what is the music we can hear each time Yusei Synchro Summon in the English version ? Thanks Traksor  ( talk  •  contribs ) 01:19, July 20, 2010 (UTC)
 
 Series end date? 
 I've been getting a lot of rumors that Yu-Gi-Oh 5D's is suppost to be ending completely by April 2011. I'm not able to find any primary or even reliable sources that can confirm these rumors, so can someone tell me if thats true or not? Thanks. -- Sky Scourge God  ( talk  •  contribs ) 00:50, November 11, 2010 (UTC)
 
  I seriously hope that Yu-Gi-Oh 5Ds isn't over for good. I can't enough of it and just the thought of there never being another season and what not make me depressed. I think it left a TON of "loose threads", like the fifth signer dragon that was shown in season 1, whats going to happen with that? And Yusei and Akiza, it kept hinting that they liked eachother, what will come of that? Someone PLEASE tell me it isn't over for good. (SilverWolf)
 
 why? 
 anybody know why 4kids is skipping episode 85?-- Soul reaper magnum  ( talk  •  contribs ) 23:36, November 22, 2010 (UTC)

 Title Confusion and new meaning 
 Major Spoilers Following
 I understand that the anime/manga/card game is called 5d's and that won't change but isn't it technically 6d's now (instead of 5 dragons there are now 6) - just curious with the events of the latest episode in japan and if there are still only 5 dragons does that mean that black winged dragon isn't a true servant of the crimson dragon as it didn't fight in the battle in the past (with the earthbound immortals)
 Spoilers End

 Black-Winged Dragon is technology Blackwing, never Signer Dragon. And Crow - Yea, I know Rua came after Crow - was never being signer along with Yusei and Jack when they reunited. Runa born to have that signer mark, while Rua obtained it later. -- F red C at   Ta.P.  •  F.P.  •  J.R.  •  W.S.  •  Th.P.  •  S.C.  23:38, January 5, 2011 (UTC)

 The End of the series 
 The end of the series ends next year in the english version between january and february what i know i don't when they will show the english version of the dvd that i am not aware of its unknown when it will appear
 
 Monster "running" or "flying" 
 Since " Speed Duel (ZEXAL) " was showing tried to featuring a Monster being running or flying while duelists are riding, so why not this article have this kind of "trivia" since this was first "anime"/"manga" showed them being run or fly instead of  that article ? If you decided to agreeing with me, please stretch the discuss further before set up the Edit-War over there. -- F r e d C a t  18:02, April 5, 2012 (UTC)
 about what 5d stands for
 about what  5ds stand for it dos not stand for 5 dragons you do know there 6 signers in 5d so 6 dragons so tell me how it can stand for 5  dragons when there are 6  do to the signers   
leo life steam dragon 
luna  a fairy dragon
jack red demon
yusei star dust
akiza black rose
crow black wing
see that make 6 
so you may want fix  your  so called idea on what 5ds stands for
 
 So-called? Show some damn manners. It was officially stated. The show had only five known dragons for more than half of its run. 
 Moving on, there weren't initially meant to be six dragons - Leo was always planned to be a Signer, but (and this is where it gets into take with a grain of salt territory), things changed with Crow. His Blackwing cards got popular in real life (apparently he was supposed to end up as a villain, maybe another Dark Signer like Greiger) so Konami requested that he be given a larger role, which resulted in his elevation to Signer and gaining a Signer Dragon, Black-Winged Dragon. This cut out some content like more of Devack's backstory and Leo becoming a Signer at that point. Or so I've heard on Tv Tropes, which wasn't sourced, so take that as you will.  Sanokal K-T  ( talk  •  contribs ) 06:41, June 9, 2014 (UTC) 
 That's all true. Pretty sure we even have Crow's Dark Signer designs on his page somewhere. Not to mention that the final Earthbound was a bird. -- BobLogical  ( talk  •  contribs ) 06:54, June 9, 2014 (UTC)
 
 Year It Was Set 
 I think I might've found the year it was set, at least in the dub. It's in "Soul Solutions", in which one of the holographs says "2021".  Ellis99   Yu-Gi-Oh! 5D's  12:10, 15 January 2022 (UTC)
