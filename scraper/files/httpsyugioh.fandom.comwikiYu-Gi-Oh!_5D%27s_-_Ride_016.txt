 Summary 
 Yusei's   Turbo Duel  continues, and Yusei Summons " Junk Armor ".  Hunter  laughs, telling Yusei to Summon every monster he has, but it won't help, not against his defensive tactic, his 100% Defense Mod. Both Duelists are at 4000  Life Points , and Yusei knows that Hunter is right. If this keeps up, he'll reach the goal before Yusei does, and Yusei will lose. He reluctantly ends his turn. 
 Lazar  continues to watch the Duel, telling Yusei that he'd better play the Shadow card soon.  Sect  and Hunter's team watch from the sidelines, Sect worrying about Yusei. Hunter begins his turn, Summoning " Signal Vehicle " in  Defense Position . The MC states that Hunter has added another defense monster, but Hunter isn't done yet. He plays his Set card, " Illegal Modding ", which allows him to  Release  his three "Vehicles" to complete his 100% Defense Mod. Declaring an "Illegal Modding Summon," he  Special Summons  " Speeding Roaring Road Guardian " in Defense Position, a 3000  DEF  monster. Hunter's goons cheer him on, and Hunter tells Yusei to give it up; with "Road Guardian" on the field, Yusei can't attack his monsters. If Yusei can't attack, then the  Sense  he's so proud of is useless, and Hunter doesn't feel like attacking him either. Now he'll just make straight for the field goal. Laughing, he speeds up and leaves Yusei even further behind, ending his turn. Yusei thinks that he can't let Hunter get any farther ahead of him, but his  Duel Runner  won't accelerate at all. 
 At the sidelines, Sect mutters that there's no way that this can be happening; Yusei never lets his Duel Runner maintanence side, not even for a day. There's just no way that this can be happening today of all days. One of Hunter's Skull Flames laughs, asking Sect what it was he said about eating dust. Another goon, with a cross-shaped scar, comments that Yusei's going to be the one chowing down. He asks Sect what's with his "no way, no way" and tells him to shut up, flicking a Duel Runner control chip into the air. Sect puts it together, realizing that Hunter's goons have sabotaged  Yusei's Duel Runner . He grabs the scarred goon by the coat lapels, angrily telling them to fight fair if they call themselves Turbo Duelists. The long haired goon crushes the chip, pointing out that Sect can't pin this on them, as he can't prove the chip was Yusei's, and he blows a bubble of gum. A blad goon adds that even if they did it, the real idiot's the guy who was tricked. The scarred goon punches Sect, knocking a card to the ground, and tells him to give up and crawl back home to  Satellite , and take that beat-up Duel Runner with them. Angrily, Sect says that's dirty, grabbing his card as Shadow Miasma rolls off it. He warns the goons that they are total scum as Shadow Miasma rolls off him, and the goons are shocked, wondering what's with him. Sect tells them that they make him sick. 
 Crow  is Dueling with " Blackwing Tamer - Obsidian Hawk Joe " out, and suddenly feels something.  Akiza , waiting for her next Duel, feels it too; an oppressive malicious feeling.  Jack  seems to be familiar with the feeling, and  Goodwin  seems to sense it too. Finally, Yusei realizes what it is - the same feeling that he felt when he Dueled the  Skeleton Knight , and he wonders what made him think of the Knight now. The MC interrupts his thoughts by pointing out that Hunter is less than a kilometer away from the goal, and Yusei determines that he needs to focus on the Turbo Duel. The distance between Hunter and the goal means that this will essentially be his last turn, and his hand doesn't have any cards that can help him, alongisde the fact that "Road Guardian" will prevent him from attacking monsters. Hunter's only 800 meters from the goal, and he laughs that the Turbo Duel was a cakewalk. Despite his situation, Yusei smiles, calling it interesting. Now he's really into this. He knows that he'll have to bet everything on his draw, and thinks that Hunter's got him on the ropes, but there's no way he's staying there. 
 He draws a  Tuner monster , and grins, then activates his Set " Blade Wing " to increase the  ATK  of " Junk Blader " by 1000, to 2800. Then he sends two cards from his hand to the Graveyard - " Junk Defender " and " Junk Forward " - to Special Summon the " Jackie Jumper " Tuner monster (the minimum being one). He turns his Runner to the right and breaks through a barrier of a ramp of road still under construction, much to the MC's horror. Hunter is 400 meters from the goal, then 80 meters, and Hunter laughs, asking Yusei if he's out of his skull. Yusei jumps, much to everyone's shock, tuning  Level 3  "Jackie Jumper" with  Level 2  "Junk Armor" and declares a "Midair  Synchro Summon ," Summoning the  Level 5  " Catapult Warrior ". Then he activates the effect of "Junk Blader", allowing it to gain 400 ATK for each " Junk " monster in his  Graveyard , three in all. "Junk Blader" is now on 4000 ATK. Then he activates the effect of "Catapult Warrior", which will inflict the ATK of "Junk Blader" to Hunter's Life Points. Hunter is horrified, but he's right on top of the goal; all he needs to do is reach it before Yusei does. He's ten meters away, but Yusei claims he'll make it from midair as Hunter reaches the five meter mark, and "Catapult Warrior" uses "Diving Catapult" to fire "Junk Blader" at Hunter, who grins as he reaches the line - and the damage hits home, reducing his Life Points to zero just in time with "Blade Shot". Yusei lands over the line, and the MC declares him the winner, calling it a complete upset. Hunter thinks that Yusei has a problem with him, but Yusei just congratulates him on a great Turbo Duel. Hunter mutters that Yusei is mouthy.
 In the security room, Lazar admits that he never though  he  would have the Shadow card. He finally found him, the one who holds the Shadow card. On the screen, Sect stands unharmed amidst the senseless bodies of the Skull Flames, with a crowd looking on in shock.
