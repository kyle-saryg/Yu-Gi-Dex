       Gerard being defeated by  Seto Kaiba .     
 Gerard , known in Japan as  Kousuke Kunisaki  (国崎康介  Kunisaki Kōsuke ) is an undercover reporter who comes to  Duel Academy  to find information on the missing students in the  Abandoned Dorm . Gerard disguises himself as a  Slifer Red  student and proceeds to wonder why students from other dorms will not speak to him and meets  Jaden Yuki ,  Syrus Truesdale , and  Chumley Huffington .
 At the Slifer Red Dorm he has a slightly hard time with the food and Jaden occasionally referring him as "old timer." Gerard investigates the  Abandoned Dorm  only to find  Alexis Rhodes  there, who is paying her respects to her brother  Atticus Rhodes . She gets frustrated with him, and he leaves. During the Duel between Jaden and  Bastion Misawa , Gerard hacks through the school's database and finds articles on students who had gone missing from the Abandoned Dorm. He takes the data hoping that it will give him good reviews while knowing that this information might also ruin the academy. 
 He then comes to watch Jaden and Bastion's Duel and after seeing his card " Skyscraper " and the two having fun while they Dueled, he decides that he only wants to help find the missing students from the Abandoned Dorm rather than getting information. During this duel, it was discovered that Gerard used to be a Duelist, but quit Dueling after he was defeated in a Duel against  Seto Kaiba .
 It is unknown if Gerard still has a Deck, but he is seen to be using "Skyscraper" in flashbacks, so it is likely that his original Deck was an " Elemental Hero " Deck.
 
 Non-canon appearances 
 In  Yu-Gi-Oh! GX Duel Academy , Gerard is an available opponent while you are in Slifer Red or Ra Yellow, using a retro Deck composed of low  Level   Normal Monsters . He also triggers two  events  of the game.
