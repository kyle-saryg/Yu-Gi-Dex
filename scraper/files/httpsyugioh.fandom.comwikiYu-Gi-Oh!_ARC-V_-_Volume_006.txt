 Story 
 Solid Vision with mass has plunged the world into the era of Action Duels. Yuya Sakaki is a Dueltainer who has come to this time in search of the Genesis Omega Dragon (G.O.D.). Reiji Akaba, who is pursuing Yuya and G.O.D., arrived shortly before Yuya. Having become the president of the Leo Corporation, he sends his company's Duelist—Sawatari, Kurosaki and Sora—after Yuya. Yuya and Akada finally face off in person. However, a masked man named Ren, who is hunting Yuya because he has the Adam Factor, barges in. Yuya defeats Ren with a Duel Runner. Meanwhile, having Dueled Ren's cohort Isaac in space, Akada learns the location of the enemy's main base and infiltrates it with Yuya. They find Sora waiting for them and he has regained his memories… [2]

 Yuto, Yuri, Yugo, Yuya, Reiji, Kurosaki, Sawatari, Sora… They're all cool and good-looking, aren't they? Which one do you like? As for me, well… Heh heh heh…♡ [2] 
 
 Message from Naohito Miyoshi 
 Foreshadowing explained! The mystery of Yuya and company! And G.O.D. makes and entrance! Volume 6 is packed with content, I had to make a lot of corrections, so it was a rough volume on a personal level… (I sweated blood.) Thanks to everyone who pointed stuff out! [2] 
 
 Message from Masahiro Hikokubo 
 Eve has journeyed through all sorts of times in all sorts of parallel worlds, and she controls legendary monsters… Does that mean she has fought legendary Duelists?! Hmm… Pretty exciting, yeah? ♡ [2]

 Mistakes 
 Like in the previous volumes since the third volume, the info about Shingo and Sora in the English publication is swapped. [2] 
 In addition, instead of displaying info in relation to  Phantasm Emperor Trilojig  in Scale 23", it showed info on " D/D/D Destiny King Zero Laplace .
