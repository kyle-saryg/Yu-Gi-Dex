Formatting 
 If anyone can fix it there is a formatting issues with the first episode.-- DarkMastero  ( talk  •  contribs ) 19:05, December 30, 2014 (UTC)
 
 Page is broken? 
 I just see the start of a box that just says "Screenshot", "Number", and "Name", but nothing else. Additionally, on all the episode pages, the previous and next episodes are always listed as "N/A'. I think the templates are broken somehow.  SirJorb  ( talk  •  contribs ) 00:01, 25 December 2020 (UTC)
 
 It may be a result of the recent software upgrades wikis have gotten.  MasterMarik  ( talk  •  contribs ) 00:26, 25 December 2020 (UTC)
