 Description 
 The beautiful and bold Mai Valentine has traveled the world, taking down all challengers along the way. Though she may seem bossy and tough, she also has a softer side, like an older sister that you can count on (But don't call her "old!"). When Dueling, her " Harpie Lady " dazzles her opponents into defeat.
 
 Biography 
 After the player advances to Stage 10, they will encounter Mai for the first time, who is engaged in a Duel with  Jay . After Mai's apparent victory, she comments that she originally had high expectations when she heard all the top Duelists would be in Duel World, and wonders if there is anyone in Duel World who can give her a challenge.
 Until the player defeats Mai at least once, whenever they challenge Mai to a Duel, she remarks that the only way to get further is by defeating her. She then observes that the player is already wondering what the next Stage will be like, and chides them for thinking too far ahead; instead, she prompts the player to never take their eyes off their opponent, especially since it's her. She concludes her dialogue by stating she's definitely in the mood for a Duel.
 Until the player defeats Mai at least once, whenever they lose to her, she will express disappointment and claim their Duel was so easy that she could have won it in her sleep. However since she's in a good mood, she tells the player, she'll give them some advice: a Duelist's spirit isn't tested when they win, but rather when they lose. In other words, she says that if a Duelist has heart, then a defeat won't break them, before rhetorically asking the player if they have heart. At this point, she says she's given enough advice to the player, and that she hopes the player will give her a challenge the next time they Duel her.
 Upon Mai's first defeat, she states that she's impressed, but that it doesn't mean she'll give up her dream. She goes on to state that a Duelist's courage is put to the test after a defeat, not a victory, and that she is confident that her loss will strengthen her, leading her to achieve her dream. Mai then leaves the player with a warning that she'll be much tougher to defeat the next time they Duel.
 After the player redeems their final unclaimed reward for Mai Valentine's Character Unlock Missions, they will encounter Mai again, who declares that because her friends are always around to help her overcome any obstacle, her spirit won't be broken that easily, and that she'll fight to the end. She tells the player to watch as her monsters dance their way to victory, and shows them her " Harpie Lady Sisters " card.

 Trivia 
 Some of the cards for which Mai has card-specific dialogue, such as the majority of the  Harpie  archetype, were not used in the anime or manga, and are references to her video game counterparts ( Duel Arena ,  Legacy of the Duelist ,  Millennium Duels , and  Tag Force ) using those said cards. 
 Mai's Summon animation for " Harpie Lady Sisters " uses the separate designs of " Harpie Lady 1 ", " 2 " and " 3 ", rather than the design of "Harpie Lady Sisters". 
 The inclusion of " Peacock " a card-specific dialogue is a reference to Mai Valentine's Japanese name, "Kujaku Mai" (孔雀舞), since  kujaku  is the Japanese word for "peacock". 
 Mai's card-specific dialogue remains unchanged for when she Summons or declares an attack with either " Harpie Lady ", "Harpie Lady 1", "Harpie Lady 2", "Harpie Lady 3", or " Cyber Harpie Lady ".
 However, Mai has 2 different dialogues that alternate whenever she Summons "Cyber Harpie Lady".
