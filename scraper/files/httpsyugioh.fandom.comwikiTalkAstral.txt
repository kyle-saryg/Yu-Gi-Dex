 Duel record 
 What's with Duel with Tetsuo? Shouldn't it be counted as Astral was possessed by No. 96 at the time.  —This unsigned comment was made by  109.93.191.219  ( talk  •  contribs ) 22:27, September 6, 2011 
 
 "Chowder Head" 
 Why does it state that Astral has a tendency to call Yuma this? Such was true in the first two episodes of the series but so far as I can tell he hasn't done it since. Bearing this in mind is it really worth stating this as a tendency?  —This unsigned comment was made by  120.146.86.7  ( talk  •  contribs ) 11:08, September 13, 2011 
 
 Black Mist 
 Regarding the memory piece gained from No. 96. I can't recall Astral stating it was Balian World. The continent shown in that flashback  [1]  reminds me of South America, but I may be wrong. Should we perhaps change it to "a planet", if we aren't sure which planet/world was shown? --  The Goblin   Talk    23:40, October 17, 2011 (UTC)
 it wasn't south America, it Africa-- Shiker the Phoenix King   and the King Emperor ( Talk ) 23:50, October 17, 2011 (UTC)
 
 Actually, we shouldn't speculate which planet is shown nor if it is the Earth. Since it wasn't stated which world that is, I will change it to "a planet". --  The Goblin   Talk    17:21, October 18, 2011 (UTC) 
 Well I don't exactly understand how it can be Earth, because that would first be seeing the future, so it wouldn't be a memory and second Astral didn't know anything about Earth in the first place. And just because a part of the planet looks like a continent from Earth, doesn't mean it is Earth  Tommy2215  ( talk  •  contribs ) 10:14, October 28, 2011 (UTC)
 Actually, looking at that picture, it may look like South America or Africa, but I don't see A Europe above Africa or North America connenected to South America. In fact, no continent would be like that. And just because Astral didn't say it was Balian World doesn't mean it isnt because he didn't say it was Earth either.

 Death 
 Since III eliminated him, should the profile page be changed so that all verbs are in the past?  F.E.A.R.  ( talk  •  contribs ) 00:43, March 25, 2012 (UTC)
 
 I don't think so. We still have to see the next episodes. But if he doesn't appear well maybe the verbs should.-- Nexus   Shiker ( Talk ) 00:46, March 25, 2012 (UTC) 
 Same situation to Yusei summoning "Junk Warrior" while battle against Z-one, either that or other would be happening - of course, like Nexus said - when the certain episode released with official truths. -- F r e d C a t  00:48, March 25, 2012 (UTC) 
 Page Update 
 Somebody should update this page, its last information regarding the anime is during Yuma VS III. ---- SharkTenjo  08:13, August 21, 2012 (UTC)
 Update again, please?  Justin Holland  ( talk  •  contribs ) 00:15, August 28, 2013 (UTC)
 
 Absorbed Numbers and Observations 
 I think we should make a separate page for the Absorbed Numbers and Astrals observations as it is slowly growing and occupies the page greatly. ---- SharkTenjo  08:15, August 21, 2012 (UTC)
 
 no longer with astral? 
 in episode 89 of yu-gi-oh! ZeXal Dark Mist is No Longer in Astral's possession he left and escaped leaving only 49  Numbers  With Yuma And Astral Should There be a Note That Number 96 Dark Mist is No longer in Astral's Possession ( 107Number  ( talk  •  contribs ) 14:08, February 5, 2013 (UTC))
 
 "Inability to absorb Chaos Numbers" 
 In episode 103, Number 96 said that Astral cannot absorb Chaos Numbers (Number C) without 96's power. Shouldn't this be mentioned?  NMBRHNTR64  ( talk  •  contribs ) 22:35, May 20, 2013 (UTC)
 
 How did you know that? -- i F r e d C a t  22:36, May 20, 2013 (UTC) 
 Subtitles for the episode. OR, if it wasn't released with subs yet, there is a forum where a helpful Japanese translator translated some of the scenes (and this was mentioned). -- UltimateKuriboh  ( talk  •  contribs ) 22:42, May 20, 2013 (UTC) 
 Yeah, I saw the subbed version of the episode. 96 also claimed that without his power, he cannot obtain all of the Numbers and that he is not qualified to obtain the Numeron Code.  NMBRHNTR64  ( talk  •  contribs ) 23:22, May 20, 2013 (UTC) 
 Ok. I see it now. I just figured that this would also be mentioned under "Abilities".  NMBRHNTR64  ( talk  •  contribs ) 23:52, May 20, 2013 (UTC) 
 101 Numbers 
 With the creation of Number 0, it's possible that Astral got 101 numbers, not 100? (0-100)  Thiviscar  ( talk  •  contribs ) 12:23, March 16, 2014 (UTC)
