 Message from Kazuki Takahashi 
 I'm really bad a computers, but Mr. Ito is a computer expert. In the original "Yu-Gi-Oh!" series, he handled all the digital work on things like special effects and card composition. When he's in front of a computer, Mr. Ito becomes my guru. [2] 
 
 Message from Akira Ito 
 I designed all the new monsters that appear in "Yu-Gi-Oh! R". It often takes me just a whole day to design one monster… but Mr. Takahashi is really fast at designing them, as they all look amazing! I enjoy design work, but it's stressful. [2]

 Story 
 When the tenth grader Yugi solved the ancient Egyptian Millennium Puzzle, another spirit took up residence in his body…Yu-Gi-Oh, the King of Games! Using his gaming skills, Yugi fought ruthless adversaries like Maximillion Pegasus, the multimillionaire creator of the collectible card game Duel Monsters, and Seto Kaiba, the teenager president of Kaiba Corporation. After winning the Battle City tournament, Yugi acquired the most powerful cards in the world: the three Egyptian God Cards "Slifer the Sky Dragon," "The God of the Obelisk" and "The Sun Dragon Ra", which were created by Pegasus based on a mysterious ancient Egyptian card game. 
 But now a new enemy has appeared. Yako Tenma of Industrial Illusions, Pegasus's company, has made a hostile takeover of Kaiba Corporation and challenged Yugi to a duel. To ensure Yugi's participation, he has kidnapped Yugi's friend Anzu, intending to use her for the diabolical R.A. Project…resurrecting Pegasus's spirit in Anzu's body. To rescue Anzu, Yugi and his friends rush to Kaiba Corporation skyscraper, where they must battle Tenma's henchmen. But Gekko Tenma, Yako's brother has joined forces with Yugi to stop his brother… and Kaiba himself has returned to take back his skyscraper from the invaders! [2] 
 
 In the Next Volume… 
 Jonouchi slings it out with Bandit Keith and his machine monsters in the most brutal rematch in duelist history! Meanwhile, Gekko and Yugi rush to the top of KaibaCorp only to find…what? Was the R.A. Project really a failure? And what about the three evil gods? The answers lie in a duel in the giant 290+ page conclusion!
