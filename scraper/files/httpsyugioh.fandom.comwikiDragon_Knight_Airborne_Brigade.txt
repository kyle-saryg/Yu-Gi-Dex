 The  Dragon Knight Airborne Brigade  is an organized group of players in the  KaibaCorp 's multiplayer  Neurons  VR Dueling system, in the  Yu-Gi-Oh!  manga .
 
 Events 
 While  Seto Kaiba  was observing a demonstration of Neurons being used by volunteer testers, the Dragon Knight Airborne Brigade were among the players he watched. They won a Duel, using " Cosmic Mineral Dragon Stone Head Dragon ", with an  ATK  of 3600 pulse, which their opponents deemed to be extraordinarily high. They were then challenged to a Duel by  Prana  and laughed at the idea of her taking on the guild, by herself. However she Summoned " Duza the Meteor Cubic Vessel ", with an ATK of 8800 Pulse and easily defeated them. [1]
