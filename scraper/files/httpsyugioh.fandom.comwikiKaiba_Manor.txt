 Manga events 
 Seto Kaiba  invited  Yugi Mutou  and  Katsuya Jonouchi  here before the  Kaiba Land grand opening . He acted as though he had forgiven Yugi for  their earlier encounter , in which Kaiba received a  Penalty Game . However, it was part of his plan to force them into his  Death-T  tournament. Yugi was suspicious as he felt they had been forced to come and were locked inside. [1] 
 Shortly after Yugi and Jonouchi arrived,  Mokuba Kaiba  treated them to a meal prepared by  the butler . However some of the meals were poisoned and Mokuba used them to play a rigged game of  Russian Roulette Dinner , with Yugi after poisoning Jonouchi. Yugi switched to  Dark Yugi  and managed to stop Mokuba cheating and win the game. [1] 
 After  Death-T , Seto was left in a coma as a result of his " Mind Crush "  Penalty Game . This required him to be under 24 hour care in the manor [2]  until he awoke at the time of the  Duelist Kingdom  tournament. [3] 
 
 Toei events 
 Seto Kaiba  invited  Yugi Muto  to the manor to show him his  Duel Monsters  collection. Yugi also brought his friends  Katsuya Jonouchi ,  Anzu Mazaki ,  Hiroto Honda  and  Miho Nosaka . Jonouchi had taken a dislike to Kaiba because of his wealth. Honda disapproved, calling Jonouchi jealous. However when he saw how easy it was for Kaiba to impress Miho, Honda started to feel the same as Jonouchi. [4]
