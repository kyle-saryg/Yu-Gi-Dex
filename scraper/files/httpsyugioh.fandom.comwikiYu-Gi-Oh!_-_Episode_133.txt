"Lesser Dragon" destroys "M-Warrior #1" ( Joey  2000 → 1600). Joey then Normal Summons " Tiger Axe " (1300/1100) in  Attack Position . On the kid's End Phase, the effect of "Reinforcements" expires (1700 → 1200/1000).
 Turn 5: Unnamed Kid 
The Kid draws. He then Normal Summons " Steel Ogre Grotto #1 " (1400/1800) in Attack Position. The Kid then activates " Polymerization " to fuse "Lesser Dragon" with "Steel Ogre Grotto 1" in order to Fusion Summon " Metal Dragon " (1850/1700) in Attack Position. "Metal Dragon" attacks and destroys "Tiger Axe" ( Joey  1600 → 1050).

Joey Normal Summons " Flame Swordsman " (1800/1600) in Attack Position. He then activates " Gust Fan ", equipping it to "Metal Dragon", raising its  ATK  by 400, and decreasing its  DEF  by 200 ("Metal Dragon": 1850 → 2250/1700 → 1500). 
 Joey then activates " Shield & Sword " to switch the  ATK  and  DEF  of all face-up monsters on the field, but the Kid activates his face-down " Castle Walls " to increase the DEF of " Metal Dragon " by 500 ("Metal Dragon": 2250/1500 → 2000) before the effect of "Shield & Sword" applies ("Metal Dragon": 2250 → 2000/2000 → 2250) ("Flame Swordsman": 1800 → 1600/1600 → 1800). Joey then uses his "Flame Swordsman" to attack "Metal Dragon" without noticing that the Kid had activated "Castle Walls". "Metal Dragon" destroys "Flame Swordsman" ( Joey  300 → 0). [Notes 1] 
 
 Featured Duel #2: Yami Yugi vs. Seto Kaiba 
 Duel continues from previous episode. 
 Yugi has 1500  Life Points  remaining and controls "Dark Magician" (2500/2100) in Attack Position, "Beta The Magnet Warrior" (1700/1600) in Defense Position, and two set cards.
 Kaiba has 2000 Life Points remaining and controls "Blue-Eyes White Dragon" (3000/2500) and "Lord of Dragons" (1200/1100) in Attack Position, "Obelisk the Tormentor" in Defense Position, and " Spell Sanctuary ".
 Turn 19: Yami Yugi 
Seto has just blocked Yugi's " Dark Magician 's" attack by reviving " Obelisk the Tormentor " through the effect of " Monster Reborn ". Yami Yugi Sets a card. On Yugi's End Phase, "Obelisk the Tormentor" returns to the Graveyard.
 Turn 20: Kaiba 
Kaiba draws "The Flute of Summoning Dragon". He then switches " Lord of Dragons " (1200/1100) to  Defense Position . Kaiba then activates " The Flute of Summoning Dragon " to  Special Summon  two more " Blue-Eyes White Dragons " from his hand (3000/2500 for both) in Attack Position. Yami Yugi then uses the effect of "The Flute of Summoning Dragon" to Special Summon " Red-Eyes Black Dragon " from his hand (2400/2000) in  Attack Position . 
 The first "Blue-Eyes White Dragon" attacks "Dark Magician", but Yugi activates his face-down " Magician's Selection " to negate the attack and destroy "Lord of D.". The second "Blue-Eyes White Dragon" attacks and destroys " Beta The Magnet Warrior ". The last "Blue-Eyes White Dragon" attacks "Red-Eyes Black Dragon", but Yugi activates his face-down " Spellbinding Circle " to reduce the ATK of "Blue-Eyes White Dragon" by 700 ("Blue-Eyes White Dragon": 3000 → 2300/2500).  "Red-Eyes Black Dragon" counter attacks and destroys the " Blue-Eyes White Dragon " affected by "Spellbinding Circle" ( Seto  2000 → 1900). 
 Duel concludes next episode. 
 
 Differences in adaptations 
 A shot of Tristan holding up Joey and telling him to cheer for Yugi is cut from the dub. 
 A scene of  Mokuba  thinking Yugi has no chance and his brother is definitely going to win is also cut. 
 " Nekogal #1 " is given more clothing in the dub. 
 The kanji on the " Shield & Sword " card is replaced with English words in the dub. 
 A shot of unconscious Joey is added when Yugi commands Red-Eyes to attack a weakened Blue-Eyes. 
 Mistakes 
       This arrows show the error.     
 In the original version, Joey's dream is actually a flashback to a tournament he entered before  Duelist Kingdom , but he uses "Shield & Sword", which he obtained on the boat to the island through trade. 
 In the dub, the text "Attack" and "Defense" shouldn't be on the the colored auras. 
 When Joey's opponent shows his " Lesser Dragon " card, it's a Level 5 or higher monster when it's actually a Level 4 monster.
