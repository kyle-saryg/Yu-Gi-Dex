 Appearance 
       Full body view of Barrett.     
 Barrett is a tall man with a stocky build. He has dark green spiky hair swept back, and crimson eyes. He wears a green jacket with four visible pouches on the chest area and sleeves, over a black shirt and what appear to be bandages covering his arms. He also wears gray pants with a black belt and black shoes. His neck is adorned with a silver pendant around his neck. After being caught in an explosion, his left eye was damaged, leaving a huge scar that is partially concealed with an eye-patch. Likewise, he gained an X-shaped scar on his chest partially covered by his shirt.
 
 Personality 
 As a war veteran Barrett is a disciplined individual, placing his duty as his top priority, as seen when he decided to accompany  Celina  to ensure her protection, although at the same time it seems he is not close minded as he decided against attempting to stop her from leaving the  Fusion Dimension .
 Barrett takes pride on his accomplishments in battling and believes that war medals are the honor of a soldier, going to the point of saying  Declan  deserves a medal for paying  Life Points  for the use of his cards. He is a firm believer in taking the first strike to gain the advantage, declaring so in his Duels before taking the first turn.
 Barrett takes serious pride in his Dueling and respects valiant and persevering opponents highly. He continued his Duel with  Yuya Sakaki  when the latter showed the resolve to continue a nearly hopeless Duel, even though he himself concluded that with Zuzu's arrival to their location, it had become a pointless Duel. Wishing to finish a Duel with such an opponent, he protested heavily to  Sergey Volkov 's interference from this perspective, rather than against Sergey's rivaling objectives. [1] 
 
 Biography 
 History 
       Barrett with his allies.     
 Barrett was a long serving veteran Dueling Soldier who guided and battled alongside his comrades. During one such battle, he directed his soldiers to move forward, only to find himself the victim of a  Set  " Widespread Ruin " that exploded on him. The fate of his comrades is unknown but Barrett was the only known survivor of the event, being left scarred. [2] 
 
 Arc League Championship 
       Celina  and Barrett watching  Dipper 's Duel.     
 Barrett traveled from the  Fusion Dimension  with  Celina , accompanying her in order to protect her instead of sending her back to her quarters. They arrived in  Paradise City , where they watched the first round of the  Arc League Championship  Duel of  Dipper O'rion  on a viewscreen on the side of a building. [4] 
 Eventually the two ambushed Dipper and forced him into a Duel with Celina. Dipper lost, and was sealed into a card by Celina. The duo planned to assault  Kev Ravenwood  as he was an  Xyz  user, but  Declan  discovered their plan and set a trap by using Kev as bait to lure the pair, which succeeded. Declan met Barrett and Celina and ordered Kev to retreat. Declan then had  Claude  seal the area off to prevent the pair from escaping. Barrett then offered to Duel Declan instead of Celina, as he was tasked with protecting her and accompanied her to ensure her safety. Celina stood aside and witnessed the Duel.
 Barrett proceeded to Duel Declan, demonstrating his veteran Dueling skills honed in the battlefield being able to severely damage him with " Beastborg Panther Predator ". Declan subsequently praised him and softly mocked him for his use of  Medal Counters  as proof that he must love war medals. Barrett agreed and said that medals were the honor of a soldier and subsequently praised Declan and claimed he deserved a medal for paying  Life Points  for the use of his cards. As the Duel progressed, Declan counterattacked by Summoning " D/D/D Marksman King Tell " and " D/D/D Oracle King d'Arc " and pushing Barrett into a corner and forcing him to use " Beastborg Medal of Honor " in an attempt to take Declan down with him.
 
         Barrett returns to the  Fusion Dimension .      However, the attempt failed due to the effect of "Oracle King" allowing Declan to gain the eventual damage as Life Points, causing Barrett to lose. [2]  He eventually came to and activated the homing beacon in his  Duel Disk , sending information of his coordinates to Duel Academy and recalling himself back to the  Fusion Dimension . [5] 
 Friendship Cup Finals 
 After hearing  Dennis ' report,  Leo Akaba  assigned Barrett a new mission to go to the  Synchro Dimension  with the  Obelisk Force  and capture  Zuzu  and  Celina . He also informed him that  Yuri  would be following shortly after and urged Barrett to work with him. Barrett refused, insisting he'd have the job done before Yuri arrived. Leo simply responded that he was counting on Barrett. [3] 
 
         Barrett takes Celina back with him.     
 After arriving to Celina's location with three Obelisk Force members, Barrett proceeded to Duel with  Yuya  who refused give him Celina. Barrett proceeded to seal away Yuya's monsters by weakening them with " Beastborg Medal of the Steel Chain " and " Beastborg Medal of the Crimson Chain ". [6]  He also prevented Yuya from using  Spell  and  Trap Cards , as well as  Normal Summoning  and  Special Summoning   monsters  with "Beastborg Medal of the Crimson Chain". Barrett told him that if he handed over Zuzu he would spare him, but Yuya refused. Barrett  Fusion Summoned  " Beastborg Wolf Kämpfer " and started to  burn  away Yuya's  LP  and his monsters  ATK . Yuri arrived to take Celina back to Duel Academy, but was stopped by  Yugo . Barrett asked for Zuzu's location again, but Yuya still refused so he continued to weaken Yuya and his monsters further. [7]  When Yuya, Yugo, and Yuri started to  act   strange , Barrett wondered what was happening. After Zuzu arrived to save Yuya, Barrett decided to end the Duel since his target arrived but continued after seeing Yuya's resolve. After reducing the  ATK  of Yuya's monsters to 0, Barrett was set to defeat Yuya on his next turn. However,  Sergey Volkov  arrived and defeated Barrett. Though defeated, Barrett used the last of his strength to take Celina back to Duel Academy. It is unknown what happened to him after that as he was never seen again.  [1] 
 
 Deck 
 Barret uses a  " Beastborg " Deck . Focusing on a balance between  Beast-Warrior  and "Sentinel"  Machine - Type   monsters , Barret employs  Fusion  between the two types. He mainly relies on  burn  tactics to gradually deplete his opponent's  LP  while gathering  Medal Counters  on "Beast-borg Medal" Trap Cards to augment his monsters. "Beast-borg Medals of the Crimson Chain" and "Steel Chain" lock his opponent's monsters and narrow their possible plays while he controls "Beastborg" monsters.
