 " Mermail Abysslinde " appears in this card's artwork. 
 This card somehow shows  Mermail Abysslinde  suffering, or being suffocated inside an orb of water. 
 Ironically, Abysslinde is a  WATER  attribute monster, as well as being an  Aqua  type monster. And, there are bubbles around the orb, suggesting that Abysslinde is struggling to breathe. 
 This may suggest the card's effect, since the orb (this card) brings out a  Mermail  monster from your deck, and its effects are negated, meaning its struggling, just like Abysslinde in this card's artwork. The monster is then destroyed after the next end phase after the card's activation, which means the monster died. If it gets any earlier such as when this is destroyed, the monster goes along with it, meaning the orb is somehow a life support.
