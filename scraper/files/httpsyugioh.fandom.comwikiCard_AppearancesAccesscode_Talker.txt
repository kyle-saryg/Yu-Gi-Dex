 Yu-Gi-Oh! VRAINS 
 In  episode 120 ,  Playmaker  uses this card during his  Master Duel  against  Ai . He  Link Summons  this card by linking " Firewall Dragon Darkfluid " with " Linkslayer ", " Cyberse Wizard " and " Backup Secretary ". Because it was Link Summoned by  linking  a  Link Monster , this card gains 1000 ATK times that Link Monster's  Link Rating  (5, so this card's ATK becomes 7300). Playmaker then activates this card's effect, banishing " Transcode Talker " from his Graveyard in order to destroy " Ignister A.I.Land ", whose destruction would also have destroyed Ai's " The Arrival Cyberse @Ignister ", but Ai's " Gatchiri @Ignister " uses its effect to prevent "The Arrival's" destruction once. Playmaker can use this card's effect multiple times a turn but can only banish Link Monsters and cannot banish more than one Link Monster of the same  Attribute . "Gatchiri's" other effect makes monsters pointing to it remain unaffected by the opponent's card effects (including this card).
 Playmaker banishes " Splash Mage " to destroy "Gatchiri"; the latter's  floating  effect lets "The Arrival" continue to remain unaffected by the opponent's card effects for the rest of the turn. 
 Playmaker banishes " Proxy F Magician " to destroy " Gussari @Ignister ". 
 Playmaker banishes " Exslayer " to destroy " Darkwight @Ignister ". 
 Playmaker banishes " Linkross " to destroy " A.I.Q ". 
 Playmaker banishes " Decode Talker " to destroy " CompromA.I.se ". 
 The destroyed cards reduce "The Arrival's" ATK to 7000, allowing this card to attack over it, but Ai banishes "Gussari" from his Graveyard in order to equalize both battling monsters' ATK and force aÂ  double KO .
