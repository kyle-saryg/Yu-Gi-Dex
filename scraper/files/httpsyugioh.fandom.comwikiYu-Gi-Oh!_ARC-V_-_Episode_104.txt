 Summary 
       Zuzu  asks  Yusho  why he's presently in the  Fusion Dimension .     
 Zuzu  looks at  Yusho Sakaki  in shock. Yusho recognizes her as well from when Zuzu was younger. Zuzu gasps that it's not a dream and it really is Yusho before bursting into tears. Zuzu calls Yusho "Uncle" (which can also be used as a term of affection for a close adult) (she does not call him this in the dub) and runs over to him, sobbing into his arm. As  Alexis  and some other  You Show  students watch Zuzu cries that everyone is worried about Yusho;  Yuya ,  Yoko  and  her father . Yusho smiles and admits that that's to be expected. He strokes Zuzu's hair and apologizes for making them worry (in the dub, he reminds her, "Cheers, not tears"). Zuzu lifts her face and asks why Yusho is here. Yusho wearily admits that a lot has happened and he explains that before he came here he was in the  Xyz Dimension . Zuzu is surprised to learn this, protesting that the Xyz Dimension was invaded by  Duel Academy . Yusho comments that Zuzu seems to know a lot as well, and he clarifies that he was in the Xyz Dimension when Duel Academy invaded, and sent across dimensions by  a certain youth . Zuzu repeats the term, and Yusho begins to tell her the youth's name.
 
       The overseer  stresses out over where   the Commander-in-chief ’s whereabouts could be.     
 In the ruins of  Heartland  a purple domed base has been set up, and a  thin man in robes  paces back and forth as he worriedly and repeatedly states that it's going too slowly; the  Arc Project  has fallen behind schedule by three days, eighteen hours, 43 minutes and 58 seconds; and he gasps that now it's 44 minutes. He gasps that at this rate  the Professor  is going to scold him for this and declares that they have to finish  turning the residents into cards  as soon as possible (this plan isn't specified in the dub), before yelling at all of his nervous subordinates and asking if they've got that. They respond that they do. Sighing, the man groans that while he's losing his mind here, the Commander-in-chief who was supposed to be taking charge is absent today as well, and he angrily asks where he went.
 Outside a young man in a large grey cloak walks through the ruins. He curses and wonders where his quarry went as he holds up half of a torn " Smile World " card. 
 Allen's  words echo in Yuya’s mind, stating that one day Yusho disappeared without warning; he abandoned them and ran away. Yuya slams his fist into the wall and snaps that that can't be true; his father would never abandon people who were suffering because of Duel Academy. He walks into the open and tells  Yuto  that he knew that Yuya's father was in the Xyz Dimension, didn't he? Yuto replies that he didn't know as Yuya walks past destroyed cards and  Duel Disks . Yuya accuses Yuto of lying, reminding him that he told him to bring smiles with Dueling, which is something that Yuya's father would have said, and thus Yuto must have met Yusho at some point. But Yuto insists that he's never met Yusho; those words were what  Lulu  said before she was captured by Duel Academy.
 
       Lulu  explains to  Saya  and a child she is comforting, that the true purpose of Dueling is to bring smiles to others and the futures of the children.     
 He remembers the invasion as people fled from an " Chaos Ancient Gear Giant ". The  Fusion Monster  trampled a car and destroyed a group of " Mecha Phantom Beast Megaraptors " with an energy beam. (The scene of the "Megaraptors'" destruction is cut from the dub.) Yuto had skidded backwards and activated his Duel Disk, only to hear Lulu cry that this was wrong. As she held a girl in her arms, Lulu protested that Dueling was supposed to bring smiles to everyone and these kids' futures, and she asked  Saya  if that was right. Yuto admits that now that he thinks about it, Lulu probably learned about Yusho's teachings through Sayaka, because it seems that Yusho taught at the  Clover Branch  that Sayaka attended. (In the dub, Yuto notes that it was especially hard on Saya, who was Yusho's number one fan while he taught.)
 
         Lulu  in a photo, hugging her big brother  Shay  and her friend  Yuto  before the invasion of  Duel Academy .     
 Yuya removes a Deck of Duel Monsters cards from a locker and he muses that Yuto's use of Yusho's words was because of Lulu (in the dub, he muses it's the reason everyone hates him). Yuto agrees as Yuya looks at a photo of Yuto,  Shay  and Lulu on the wall, the boys both in Lulu's arms. Yuya heads down a staircase and he wonders if the reason that he's able to talk to Yuto now is because they're in the Xyz Dimension. Yuto explains that back when Yuya Dueled  Barrett  he heard a voice seething from deep inside him and the feeling that  their   four dragons  were trying to become one. Yuya agrees, recalling the unpleasant feeling of having one's mind and body being taken over by some unknown being as he walks outside. Yuto suggests that their ability to communicate now has something to do with that, and he admits that this was according to the intentions of " Dark Rebellion ". Yuya stops and he wonders what is going on.
 
         The cloaked duelist  engages his Duel Disk, revealing to be a member of  Duel Academy  due to its shape .     
 A voice asks Yuya what he's doing here, and Yuya looks up to see the cloaked man standing in the ruins of a building above him. Yuya explains that he's looking for his father, but flinches in shock when the man leaps down in front of him with ease. The cloaked man comments that Yuya must have gotten lost and he asks what Yuya's father's name is; he'll surely be able to find him (in the dub, he comments that hunting people is his specialty.) Yuya asks who the cloaked man is but the cloaked man impatiently tells Yuya to hurry up. Yuya flinches again and he states that his father's name is Yusho Sakaki, much to the cloaked man's shock. The man clenches his fist and he asks if Yuya is the son of  that  Yusho Sakaki. Yuya asks if the man knows his father, and the cloaked man angrily declares that he would never forget him (in the dub, Yuya asks if he knew Yusho was a hero; the cloaked man replies he was a zero). Yuya immediately begins backing away after seeing the expression in the cloaked man's eyes and he realizes that there's someone in this dimension who hates his father. The cloaked man declares that this is perfect; if Yuya really is Yusho Sakaki's son, then the cloaked Duelist can use Yuya as bait to draw him out. He activates a Duel Academy Disk, and Yuya and Yuto realize that the cloaked Duelist is from Duel Academy. Yuya asks if the Duelist battled Yusho and asks when and where, but the cloaked Duelist replies that it has nothing to do with Yuya. Yuya begs the cloaked Duelist to tell him what happened between the Duelist and Yuya's father but the Duelist tells Yuya that that's enough pointless chatter. Yuya narrows his eyes and straps on his Duel Disk, activating the  Field Spell Card , " Crossover ". The blue suffuses the area and the platforms materialize and Yuya thinks that he'll find out what happened between the Duelist and Yusho, before both Duelists declare "Duel!", with the cloaked Duelist being labelled as "Unknown". 
 
         Yuto  warns  Yuya  to not let his guard down, due to his opponent being a member of  Duel Academy .     
 Yuya declares that he's going first, Summoning " Performapal Flip Hippo " from his hand. The sight of a " Performapal " monster causes the cloaked Duelist to react as he recognizes the archetype. Yuya explains that since "Flip Hippo" was  Normal Summoned , he can  Special Summon  a "Performapal" monster from his hand, and he Special Summons " Performapal Hip Hippo ". Then he activates the effect of "Flip Hippo" to switch both "Hippos" to  Defense Position , and he  Sets  a card to end his turn. Yuto warns Yuya that his opponent is from Duel Academy, so he shouldn't let his guard down. Yuya replies that he knows, but he wants to know where his father went, so he has to talk to the Duelist. The cloaked Duelist notes that since Yuya uses "Performapals" as well there's no doubt that he's Yusho Sakaki's son, so in that case the Duelist will go all out (in the dub, he plans to show Yuya that Dueltaining only leads to defeat).
 The cloaked Duelist declares his turn and he draws. He Summons " Destiny HERO - Drilldark " from his hand, and then he activates the  Spell Card  " D-Pressure " since he Normal Summoned a " Destiny HERO " monster this turn, allowing him to Special Summon a "Destiny HERO" with equal or less  ATK  from his hand, and he declares "Come on! Another one!" in English as he Special Summons a second "Drilldark". The cloaked Duelist explains that "Drilldark" can inflict  piercing  damage and enters his  Battle Phase , declaring "Go Drilldarks!  Go fight! " ("Piercing Peril" in the dub) as he attacks "Flip Hippo" with one "Drilldark" and destroys it, reducing Yuya to 3200  LP . The second "Drilldark" then attacks and destroys "Hip Hippo", and Yuya is blasted backwards and reduced to 2400 LP. The cloaked Duelist Sets two cards and he ends his turn. Yuto asks if Yuya is all right, and he warns Yuya that the Duelist is serious about taking Yuya down. Yuya replies that even so he will still believe that they can talk through Dueling.
 
         Yuya  activates the card that belonged to his father, " Smile World ".     
 He declares his turn and draws his own "Smile World", which he immediately activates, much to the Duelist's shock. Colorful smiling shapes radiate from the card and Yuya explains that it will increase the ATK of all monsters on the field by 100 for each monster on the field until the  End Phase . With two monsters on the field, both "Drilldarks" gain 200 ATK, increasing to 1800 ATK each. The cloaked Duelist clenches his fist in fury as he repeats the card's name (in the dub, he interrupts Yuya, saying he knows how the card works). Yuya continues by activating the  Trap Card  " Smile Potion ", allowing him to draw two cards since his opponent's monsters gained ATK and he controls no monsters. A glass bottle of purple potion appears and pours, producing a burst of smiling shapes as Yuya draws happily. The cloaked Duelist activates a Set card, the Trap Card " D-Fusion ", which he can only activate on his opponent's turn. It allows him to send monsters he controls to the  Graveyard  to perform a  Fusion Summon . Yuto warns Yuya that it's coming and Yuya agrees as he looks around. Fusing his two "Drilldarks", the cloaked Duelist  chants , "My twin heroes who pierce through the bedrock of destiny! Become one now and reign supreme in the pitch-black future! Fusion Summon!  Come on !  Destiny HERO - Dystopia !" ("I'm using the thrill of the drill to unearth a mighty new menace! I Fusion Summon Destiny HERO - Dystopia!" in the dub.)
 
         " Destiny HERO - Dystopia " emerges, with the moon shining behind it.     
 Yuya curses as "Smile World" fades with its targets gone and turns and runs. The cloaked Duelist activates the effect of "Dystopia", inflicting damage to Yuya equal to the ATK of one of its  Fusion Materials . "Dystopia" leaps into the air and blasts a sphere from its palm with its " Tumbling Palm " effect, blasting the fleeing Yuya in the back and knocking him down, reducing him to 800 LP. Yuto protests that Yuya is getting tossed around and yet he's still insisting on talking to the cloaked Duelist. Yuya replies that he is, he believes that he can talk to the Duelist as long as it's through Dueling. Yuto protests that the Duelist is from Duel Academy, who burned down his hometown. Yuya yells that the Duelist knows Yuya's father, so if he doesn't take his chance now he won't have another opportunity to gain some clues. Yuto states that the cloaked Duelist hates Yusho Sakaki; in other words even Yusho wouldn't be able to make him smile. Yuya is shocked at the implication and Yuto admits that when he returned to his hometown and saw the desolated scenery he had some second thoughts. Bringing smiles with Dueling is certainly an ideal, but they can only achieve that ideal after Duel Academy has been defeated. (In the dub, Yuto also states his intention to make the calls that Yuya won't.) Yuya yells Yuto's name, but suddenly he gasps and doubles over in pain.
 
         Yuto  takes possession of  Yuya , activating " Performapal Seal Eel " and “ Performapal Changeraffe ” setting his  Pendulum Scale .     
 When Yuya opens his eyes, they are glowing purple and the glow fades into Yuto's grey as an image of Yuto ripples out from Yuya. Speaking in unison, Yuya and Yuto declare that they are using the Scale 3 " Performapal Seal Eel " and the Scale 5 " Performapal Changeraffe " to Set the  Pendulum Scale , allowing them to simultaneously Summon  Level 4 monsters . Yuya chants, "Swing, pendulum of the soul!" and Yuto chants, "Draw an arc of light across the aether!" They both declare " Pendulum Summon !" and Yuya declares, "Appear now, my monsters! ("Swing far, pendulum! Carve" The cloaked Duelist whispers, "Pendulum" as Yuya Pendulum Summons " Performapal Skeeter Skimmer " and " Performapal Helpprincess ". The cloaked Duelist gasps that this is a Pendulum Summon. Yuya activates the  Pendulum Effect  of "Seal Eel", negating the effect of "Dystopia" and gaining LP equal to the damage that it inflicted. "Seal Eel" blasts a red "X" at "Dystopia", covering its eyes and returning Yuya to 2400 LP. Then Yuya  overlays  the Level 4 "Skeeter Skimmer" and "Helpprincess" and he and Yuto chant, "Formed from pitch-black darkness, to fight those foolish enough to oppose it with its treacherous fangs! Now, descend!  Xyz Summon ! Appear now!  Rank 4 !  Dark Rebellion Xyz Dragon ! ((Dub) "Cloaked in shadows and relentless in its objective, I call upon the most dangerous of dragons! I Xyz Summon  Dark Rebellion Xyz Dragon !")" Yuya activates the effect of "Dark Rebellion", detaching an Overlay Unit to halve the ATK of a  Level 5  or higher monster his opponent controls and have "Dark Rebellion" gain that lost ATK. "Dark Rebellion" unfolds its wings and blasts electricity from them, entrapping "Dystopia" and reducing it to 1400 ATK, while increasing to 3900 ATK with its "Treason Discharge" effect. The cloaked Duelist curses, lamenting the negation of the effect of "Dystopia". Yuya uses the other Overlay Unit, further reducing "Dystopia" to 700 ATK and increasing the ATK of "Dark Rebellion" to 4600 as he and Yuto declare "Treason Discharge" again. Yuya declares his Battle Phase and attacks "Dystopia" with "Dark Rebellion Xyz Dragon's" "Mauling Mandible Charge" attack. The cloaked Duelist explains that a monster that was Fusion Summoned with "D-Fusion" cannot be destroyed during the turn it was Summoned. Yuya reminds the Duelist that he will take the damage, and the Duelist's LP takes a huge hit, falling all the way to 100. Yuya ends his turn, and the ATK of "Dark Rebellion" returns to normal and the Pendulum Effect of "Seal Eel" ends. He closes his eyes and groans in pain before opening them with their normal red color again. The cloaked Duelist rises to his feet and he admits that he didn't expect the son of Yusho Sakaki to be able to Xyz Summon, given that Yusho claimed to come from a  different dimension . But it doesn't matter; the Duelist will do whatever he has to take Yuya down.
 
         The cloaked duelist  draws from his deck claiming he will do whatever it takes to defeat the son of  Yusho Sakaki .     
 He declares his turn and draws, before attacking "Dark Rebellion Xyz Dragon" and destroying it with the "Dystopian Destruction" attack of "Dystopia". Yuya falls to 2100 LP, but he immediately activates the Pendulum Effect of "Changeraffe", Special Summoning "Dark Rebellion" since it was destroyed. The Duelist notes that Yuya hasn't learned his lesson and brought out that  Xyz Monster  again and he activates a Trap Card, " D-Doom Dance " by banishing one of his "Drilldarks" from the Graveyard. It will reduce the ATK of "Dark Rebellion" by the ATK of the banished "Drilldark" since it was Special Summoned during the Battle Phase. The ATK of "Dark Rebellion" falls to 900 and Aster explains that in addition it will allow a "Destiny HERO" to attack again and orders "Dystopia's" "Dystopian Destruction" attack. Yuya reveals that the effect of "Changeraffe" will prevent the destruction of "Dark Rebellion" this turn and the cloaked Duelist warns him that he will still take the damage. Yuya is blasted backwards and his LP falls to 200, and the Duelist activates the  Continuous Spell Card  " D-Faceoff " from his hand to end his turn. As Yuya struggles up, the cloaked Duelist claims that Yuya won't be able to beat him if he keeps using Xyz Monsters; during the End Phase of each turn "Death Match" will allow the Duelist to compare the total  Levels  of monsters they control. If the cloaked Duelist has the higher total, then a "Destiny HERO" he controls will gain ATK equal to the difference times 100. Yuya realizes the problem and Yuto confirms it; Xyz Monsters don't have Levels. 
 
         Yuya  dodges the  damage  from the effect of " D-Faceoff " with the  Action Card   Acceleration .     
 The cloaked Duelist declares that that's exactly it; his "Dystopia" is  Level 8 , while "Dark Rebellion Xyz Dragon" has no Level. The difference is 8, so "Dystopia" will gain 800 ATK, bringing it up to 3600. In addition the Duelist activates the effect of "Dystopia" since its ATK changed, allowing him to destroy a card on the field. He decides to destroy "that eyesore of a Seal Eel", and "Dystopia" sucks "Seal Eel" into its palm and crushes it with "Noble Justice". Yuya gasps in shock as the  Pendulum Zone  fades and the cloaked Duelist declares that Yuya can no longer negate the effect of "Dystopia". He'll have Yuya take some damage as well; "Doom Dance" also inflicts the value that "Dystopia" gained as ATK to Yuya. "Doom Dance" blasts a column of energy at Yuya, who vaults away and grabs an  Action Card , " Acceleration ", negating the effect damage. He dives away from the energy again, and the cloaked Duelist is shocked by the use of the Action Card. He muses that he sees, but tells Yuya that it's useless; he can damage Yuya every End Phase with the effect of "D-Faceoff". 
 
         Yuto  activates “ The Phantom Knights' Rank-Up-Magic Launch ".     
 Yuto declares that he won't forgive the cloaked Duelist, much to Yuya's horror (cut from the dub). Yuto declares that the Duelist has been hunting down his comrades like this, and he's certain that he defeated the Duelists of  the Resistance . Yuya whispers Yuto's name and Yuto admits that right now he's regretting ever going to the Standard Dimension. Had he stayed he probably would have been able to protect  Kite 's family and his many comrades. Yuya yells that that's enough and he tells Yuto to stop it, but he groans in pain again and doubles over. When he opens his eyes they are glowing purple again and fade into grey as Yuto declares his turn ("Payback time" in the dub) and draws. He's drawn " The Phantom Knights' Rank-Up-Magic Launch ", which he subsequently activates, allowing him to use both it and "Dark Rebellion" as Material to Xyz Summon a monster one  Rank  higher. He and Yuya chant, "From the depths of purgatory, sing the song of rebellion dedicated to the restless souls! Appear now and echo for eternity!  Rank-Up Xyz Evolution ! Come forth!  Rank 5 !  Dark Requiem Xyz Dragon !" (In the dub, Yuya chants, "Dragon from the bleak, black pit!", while Yuto chants, "Fierce, fearless, ferocious fighter!", and Yuya then chants, "Rise and master the skies!" They both then chant, "Go, Rank-Up Xyz Evolution! Arise, Dark Requiem Xyz Dragon!")
 
         " Dark Requiem Xyz Dragon " prepares for the final attack, shining it's stained-glass wings in the light.     
 Yuto activates the effect of "Dark Requiem Xyz Dragon", detaching an Overlay Unit to reduce the ATK of a Level 5 or higher monster his opponent controls to zero and gain that lost ATK. The orbs on the wings of "Dark Requiem" drain into black holes and blast out streams of darkness as Yuya and Yuto declare "Requiem Retribution!" "Dystopia" is entrapped and reduced to zero ATK, while the ATK of "Dark Requiem" rises from 3000 to 6600. The cloaked Duelist calls it useless and activates the effect of "Dystopia" since its ATK changed to destroy "Dark Requiem Xyz Dragon". But Yuto activates the other effect of "Dark Requiem Xyz Dragon", detaching another Overlay Unit to negate the effect and Special Summon the original "Dark Rebellion Xyz Dragon" from the Graveyard. The cloaked Duelist curses Yuya managing to negate the effect and revive his dragon. Yuya declares his Battle Phase, attacking "Dystopia" with "Dark Requiem Xyz Dragon". "Dark Requiem" ascends into the sky and spreads its wings, stained glass membranes materializing between the wing fingers. Yuya and Yuto declare that this is the finishing blow and order "Dark Requiem Xyz Dragon" to attack with "Dark Destruction". "Dark Requiem" charges with its tusks glowing and the cloaked Duelist runs backwards and grabs an Action Card. But it's " Miracle ", who's effect to halve the battle damage will not help him, and the cloaked Duelist curses that he can't use it. 
 
         The cloaked Duelist reveals himself to be  Aster Phoenix , the Commander-in-chief of  Duel Academy .     
 Since it's come to this the cloaked Duelist discards " Destiny HERO - Dynatag " since he has less LP than his opponent and a monster he controls is battling, negating the battle damage and inflicting 1000 damage to both players. Yuya gasps in shock and "Dynatag" appears and explodes, blasting Yuya backwards and into a wall fragment, which shatters and covers him in rubble as his LP falls to zero. The cloaked Duelist manages to keep his footing, but falls to one knee as his LP falls to zero as well. No sooner than the Duel has ended a jeep screeches to a halt, and a voice asks the Commander-in-chief if he is hurt. Yuya thinks, "Commander-in-chief" before passing out. (In the dub, they specifically name him as "Commander Phoenix".)  Blue-jacketed  Duel Academy students rush up to the Commander-in-chief, who dusts off his shoulders and removes his hood, revealing himself to be a teenage boy as he scowls in frustration. 
 Yusho's voice names the youth who sent him across dimensions as Aster Phoenix, the Commander-in-chief at Duel Academy. Zuzu asks, "Aster Phoenix?" as Yusho stares at the other half of the torn "Smile World" card. (In the dub, Zuzu asks who the Commander is, to which Yusho replies with Aster's name; Yusho further refers to Aster as one of his most exceptional opponents.)
 
 Featured Duel: Yuya Sakaki and Yuto vs. Aster Phoenix 
         Yuya  vs.  Aster .     
 At the start of the  Duel , the  Field Spell Card  " Crossover " is  activated , as per the rules of an  Action Duel . It will allow the players to use  Action Cards , but they may only have one in their  hand  at a time.
 Turn 1: Yuya 
 Yuya   Normal Summons  " Performapal Flip Hippo " (800/800). As it was Normal Summoned, its  effect  activates, letting Yuya  Special Summon  a " Performapal "  monster  from his hand. He Special Summons " Performapal Hip Hippo " (800/800) in  Attack Position . Yuya activates the other effect of "Flip Hippo", switching all monsters he  controls  to  Defense Position . Yuya  Sets  a card.
 Turn 2: Aster 
 Aster  Normal Summons " Destiny HERO - Drilldark " (1600/1200). As Aster Normal Summoned a " Destiny HERO " monster this turn, he then activates " D-Pressure ", allowing him to Special Summon a "Destiny HERO" monster from his hand with  ATK  equal to or less than that of the Normal Summoned monster. He Summons a second copy of "Drilldark" (1600/1200). A "Drilldark"  attacks  and  destroys  "Flip Hippo", with its effect inflicting  piercing   battle damage  to Yuya (Yuya: 4000 → 3200 LP). The second "Drilldark" attacks and destroys "Hip Hippo" (Yuya: 3200 → 2400 LP). Aster Sets two cards.
 Turn 3: Yuya 
Yuya  draws  and subsequently activates " Smile World ", increasing the ATK of every monster on the field by 100 for every monster on the field until the  End Phase  (both "Drilldarks": 1600 → 1800 ATK). As an opponent's monster gained ATK while he controls no monsters, Yuya activates his  face-down  " Smile Potion ", allowing him to draw two cards. Aster activates his face-down " D-Fusion ", letting him  Fusion Summon  a "Destiny HERO"  Fusion Monster  using monsters he controls as  Fusion Materials . He  fuses  the two "Drilldarks" to Fusion Summon " Destiny HERO - Dystopia " (2800/2400) in Attack Position. As it was Fusion Summoned, its effect activates, letting Aster inflict  damage  to Yuya equal to the ATK of one of its Fusion Materials. He  targets  a "Drilldark" (Yuya: 2400 → 800 LP).
 At this point,  Yuto  takes over for Yuya. Yuto activates " Performapal Seal Eel " (   3) and " Performapal Changeraffe " (   5) in his  Pendulum Zones . Yuto  Pendulum Summons  " Performapal Skeeter Skimmer " (500/1600) and " Performapal Helpprincess " (1200/1200), both in Attack Position. He then activates the  Pendulum Effect  of "Seal Eel", allowing him to  negate  the effects of a monster on the  field  until the end of the turn and gain  LP  equal to the amount of effect damage he received from that monster (Yuto: 800 → 2400 LP). Yuto  overlays  his two  Level  4 monsters to  Xyz Summon  " Dark Rebellion Xyz Dragon " (2500/2000) in Attack Position. Yuto activates the effect of "Dark Rebellion" twice,  detaching  an  Overlay Unit  to halve the ATK of a Level 5 or higher monster his opponent controls and add that ATK to that of "Dark Rebellion" ("Dystopia 2800 → 1400 → 700, "Dark Rebellion" 2500 → 3900 → 4600). "Dark Rebellion" attacks "Dystopia", with the effect of "D-Fusion" preventing the destruction of the "Dystopia" during the turn it is Summoned (Aster: 4000 → 100 LP). Yuya regains control.
 Turn 4: Aster 
"Dystopia" attacks and destroys "Dark Rebellion" (Yuya: 2400 → 2100 LP). As a monster he controls was destroyed, Yuya activates the Pendulum Effect of "Changeraffe", Special Summoning that monster in Attack Position. "Dark Rebellion" is Special Summoned (2500/2000). The other effect of "Changeraffe" prevents that Special Summoned monster from being  destroyed by battle  or card effects this turn. As his opponent Special Summoned a monster during the Battle Phase, Aster activates his face-down " D-Doom Dance ", allowing him to  banish  a "Destiny HERO" monster from his Graveyard to have that Special Summoned monster lose ATK equal to that of the banished monster. He banishes "Drilldark" ("Dark Rebellion 2500 → 900). As he activated "D-Doom Dance" during a turn where a "Destiny HERO" monster attacked, "Doom Dance" lets that "Destiny HERO" monster attack again. "Dystopia" attacks "Dark Rebellion" with the effect of "Changeraffe" preventing "Dark Rebellion" from being destroyed by  battle  (Yuya: 2100 → 200 LP). Aster activates " D-Faceoff ". During the End Phase, the effect of "D-Faceoff" activates, letting Aster compare the Levels of all monsters both players control and inflict damage to the player whose value is lower equal to the difference in Levels times 100. If Aster has the highest value and controls a "Destiny HERO" monster, one of those monsters will gain ATK equal to that the difference in ATK ("Dystopia": 2800 → 3600). As the ATK or  DEF  of "Dystopia" changed, its effect activates, letting Aster destroy a card on the field. Aster destroys "Seal Eel". The other effect of "Death Match" then activates, inflicting 800 damage to Yuya. Yuya finds and activates the Action Card " Acceleration ", reducing the damage to 0. Yuto takes over for Yuya again.
 Turn 5: Yuto 
Yuto draws and subsequently activates " The Phantom Knights' Rank-Up-Magic Launch ",  Ranking Up  "Dark Rebellion" and performing a  Rank-Up Xyz Evolution  to Special Summon " Dark Requiem Xyz Dragon " (3000/2500) in Attack Position. Due to the effect of "Launch", it is  attached  to "Requiem" as an Overlay Unit. Yuto activates its effect, detaching an Overlay Unit to reduce the ATK of a Level 5 or higher monster his opponent controls to 0 and increase the ATK of "Dark Requiem" by the amount reduced ("Dystopia": 3600 → 0, "Requiem": 3000 → 6600). [notes 1]  As the ATK of "Dystopia" changed, its effect activates, with Aster trying to destroy "Dark Requiem", but Yuto activates the other effect of "Dark Requiem" as an effect was activated that would destroy a card on the field, detaching an Overlay Unit to Special Summon an Xyz Monster from his Graveyard and negate that effect. Yuto Special Summons "Dark Rebellion" (2500/2000) in Attack Position. "Requiem" attacks "Dystopia". Aster finds the Action Card " Miracle ", but doesn't activate it as it would not prevent him from losing. Aster activates the effect of the " Destiny HERO - Dynatag " in his hand. As his LP are lower than his opponent's and a monster he controls is battling, he can send "Dynatag" from his hand to the Graveyard to reduce the damage to 0 and inflict 1000 damage to both players (Aster: 100 → 0 LP, Yuto: 200 → 0 LP).

 Trivia 
 This episode marks the first time that the dub has named the effect name of " Dark Rebellion Xyz Dragon ", confirming it to be the same as the Japanese; "Treason Discharge". 
 Errors 
 In the anime, " Performapal Helpprincess " cannot be Pendulum Summoned. But Yuto Pendulum Summoned her along with " Performapal Skeeter Skimmer ". This error move can be corrected if Yuto Normal Summoned "Skeeter Skimmer" first, then activated "Helpprincess" effect from his hand to Special Summon her. 
 In both versions as Lulu says to Saya that Dueling should be for smiles her purple bang          Lulu's bang disappears when looking at Saya     disappears.

 Notes 
 
 ↑   The written Japanese anime lore of "{{subst:anime|Dark Requiem Xyz Dragon}}" states it gains  ATK  equal to the  original ATK  of the  target , but  Yuto  himself says it does so by the amount reduced and the  effect  is depicted that way in the episode.
