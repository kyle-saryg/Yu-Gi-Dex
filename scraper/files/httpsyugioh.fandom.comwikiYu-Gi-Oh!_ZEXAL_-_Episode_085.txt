 Featured Duels 
 Battle Royal: Yuma, Shark, Rio and Alito vs. various brainwashed Duelists 
 The full  Duel  is not shown.
 Shark 's " Big Jaws "  attacks  and  destroys  an opponent's " Inzektor Dragonfly " (Opponent: 800 → 0 LP).  Rio 's " Ice Beast Zerofyne " attacks an opponent  directly  (Opponent: 2000 → 0 LP) and  Yuma 's " Gagaga Cowboy " does the same to another opponent (Opponent: 1500 → 0 LP).
 The various Duelists Summon " King of Yamimakai ", " Sabersaurus ", " Boar Soldier ", " Jirai Gumo ", " Skull Knight ", " Twin-Headed Behemoth ", " Giant Rat ", " Doron ", " Giant Orc ", " Malice Doll of Demise " and " Berserk Gorilla ". The monsters all attack, but  Alito  appears in front of Yuma. He  activates  " Lightning Clinch ",  paying  3000  Life Points  (Alito: 4000 → 1000 LP) to  negate  those attacks. Alito draws " Brain Reboot " and subsequently activates it (as his Life Points are 1000 or less),  returning  all monsters on the field to their owners'  hands  and inflicting damage to all players equal to the combined  Levels  of the monsters returned to their hand by this effect times 500 (All opponents ? → 0 LP).
 
 Yuma Tsukumo vs. Alito 
 Turn 1: Alito 
 Alito  draws. He then  Normal Summons  " Battlin' Boxer Headgeared " ( 4/1000/1800) in Attack Position. As he  controls  a " Battlin' Boxer "  monster , Alito  Special Summons  " Battlin' Boxer Sparrer " ( 4/1200/1400) via its own  effect  in Attack Position. He then  overlays  "Battlin' Boxer Headgeared" and "Battlin' Boxer Sparrer" in order to  Xyz Summon  " Battlin' Boxer Lead Yoke " ( 4/2200/2000, ORU: 2) in  Attack Position . Alito  Sets  three cards.
 Turn 2: Yuma 
 Yuma  draws. He then Normal Summons " Gagaga Magician " ( 4/1500/1000) in Attack Position. Yuma then targets "Gagaga Magician" (a " Gagaga " monster) in order to Special Summon " Gagaga Child " via its own effect in Attack Position with its Level becoming the same as "Gagaga Magician" ( 2 → 4/800/1200). Yuma then overlays "Gagaga Magician" and "Gagaga Child" in order to Xyz Summon " Number 39: Utopia " ( 4/2500/2000, ORU: 2) in Attack Position. As "Gagaga Child" was used for the Xyz Summon of "Utopia", the second effect of "Gagaga Child" forbids "Utopia" from attacking during the turn it is Xyz Summoned. 
 Yuma  Sets  three cards. Alito activates his  face-down  " Overlay Flash " to  detach  an  Overlay Unit  from "Lead Yoke" ("Lead Yoke": 2 → 1 ORU) and  negate  the effects of "Utopia". As an Overlay Unit was detached from "Lead Yoke", its second effect increases its ATK by 800 ("Lead Yoke": 2200 → 3000 ATK).
 Turn 3: Alito 
Alito draws. "Lead Yoke" attacks "Utopia", but Yuma activates his face-down " Battle Rush " to prevent his monster from being  destroyed by battle  and inflict the  Battle Damage  he would take to Alito instead. As a  Trap Card  was activated during the  Battle Phase , Alito activates his face-down " Fancy Footwork ", negating the activation of "Battle Rush" and destroying it. As a Trap Card was activated during the Battle Phase when two Xyz Monsters were  battling , Yuma activates his face-down " Xyz Strike " to negate and destroy "Fancy Footwork" as well as  draw a card  and  reveal  it. If it is a monster, the ATK of the battling monsters will swap and the ATK of the opponent's monster will become 0. If it is a  Spell  or Trap Card, the Battle Damage Yuma takes will double. As Yuma activated a  Counter Trap Card  during a battle, Alito activates his face-down " Counter Clash " to negate and destroy "Xyz Strike" as well as double all Battle Damage from this battle. "Lead Yoke" then destroys "Utopia" (Yuma: 4000 → 3000 LP).
 Turn 4: Yuma 
Yuma draws " Xyz Revenge " and subsequently activates it (as his opponent controls an Xyz Monster which has an Overlay Unit) to revive "Utopia" ( 4/2500/2000) in Attack Position and  attach  the Overlay Unit of "Lead Yoke" to "Utopia" ("Lead Yoke": 1 → 0 ORU, "Utopia": 0 → 1 ORU). The second effect of "Lead Yoke" activates ("Lead Yoke": 3000 → 3800 ATK). [Notes 1]  As the ATK of an opponent's monster increased, Yuma activates his face-down " Fiery Fervor ",  equipping  it to "Utopia" and doubling its ATK ("Utopia": 2500 → 5000 ATK). "Utopia" attacks and destroys "Lead Yoke" (Alito: 4000 → 2800 LP).
 Duel continues in  the next episode.

 Differences from the preview 
 Towards the end of the preview, it shows  Alito  holding three cards, covering his face and then  Setting  them, but when the episode airs he Sets the cards first.
 
 Differences in adaptations 
 Alito  bleeding is cut from the dub. 
 The scene where  Tori  mentions Alito can see  Astral  is cut from the dub. 
 Errors 
 In the dub, when " Xyz Strike " is  destroyed , the Japanese version of the card can be seen for a moment. 
 Trivia 
 " Battlin' Boxer Lead Yoke " had hair  the last time  it appeared, but in this episode, it is given a helmet. The flashback to the previous appearance also includes the helmet. 
 Notes 
 
 ↑   The written Japanese anime lore of " Battlin' Boxer Lead Yoke " says its  ATK  boosting  effect  only  activates  upon an  Overlay Unit  being  detached  by the first effect of "Lead Yoke".
