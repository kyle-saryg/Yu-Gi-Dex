 To  activate  (Japanese:  発 動   Hatsudō ) is to use a card or effect in a way that makes a  Chain Link .
 
 Mechanics 
 All activated cards and effects have a  Spell Speed . Cards and effects cannot be activated in  response  to cards or effects with higher Spell Speed. Cards and effects also cannot be activated while a  Chain  is  resolving .
 To activate a  Spell  or  Trap Card  is to play it on the  field   face-up  from your  hand  or flipped from  face-down  on the field. Trap Cards and  Quick-Play Spell Cards  cannot be activated during the same turn they were  Set . If the activation of a card is  negated , that card will not be treated as being on the field. [1] [2] 
 To activate an  effect  is to choose to apply a  Trigger  or  Trigger-like ,  Ignition  or  Ignition-like , or  Quick  or  Quick-like Effect . When activating an effect from a location that is not  public knowledge , the card that activated the effect is  revealed  by  game mechanics .
 Activating a card is distinct from activating its effect. For example, " Magic Jammer " and the effect of " Dark Paladin " can only be activated when the card " Supply Squad " is activated, but cannot be activated when the effect of "Supply Squad" is activated.
 
 Activation requirements 
 There are several requirements that must be met in order to activate a card.
 
 A card or effect can only be activated if that card or effect meets its  activation conditions . However, some cards do not have any activation conditions.
 For example, " Dark Magic Attack " cannot be activated if the player does not  control  a " Dark Magician ". However, " Harpie's Feather Duster " can, because it has no activation conditions. 
 The activation  cost  for a card or effect must be paid in order to activate a card or effect. However, some cards do not have any cost.
 For example, " Twister " cannot be activated if the player cannot  pay  500  LP  (such as due to having less than 500 LP). However, " Mystical Space Typhoon " can, because it has no cost. 
 It is not possible to activate a card or effect if the effect would fail to do anything when it resolved.
 For example, " Lightning Vortex " cannot be activated if the opponent does not control any  face-up  monsters. 
 It is not possible to activate a card or effect if it has no valid target.
 For example, the effect of " Zombie Master " cannot be activated if there are no  Zombie - Type  monsters in either  Graveyard  that can be  Special Summoned .
