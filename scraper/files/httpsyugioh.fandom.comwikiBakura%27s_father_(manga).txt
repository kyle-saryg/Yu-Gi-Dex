 Biography 
 At some point, Bakura's partner and their daughter,  Amane , died in a car accident. [3] 
 Bakura was fascinated by the  Millennium Ring  and spent most of his life searching for it. His investigations led him to believe it was located in the  Valley of the Kings , so he and his son,  Ryo  moved to Egypt. Ryo, fearing his father would be in danger, secretly followed him during the a trip to find the Millennium Ring. [1]

 Bakura made his way to the  Shrine of the Underworld , which was then occupied by  Shadi Shin  and a group of  Prana  children. Ryo hid behind a pillar and watched. Bakura spotted the ring, inside the  Tablet of the Pharaoh's Memories  and excitedly proceeded to take it. Shadi warned of him of the ring's dangers, but his obsessions had led him to not care. He opened a sack of money and offered to pay any price. Believing he had no business interfering with what destiny had planned, Shadi did not stop Bakura. He explained that the ring could not be purchased, but if Bakura wanted to take it, he must put it on and allow the ring to decide if he is worthy. Bakura complied and announced that wearing the ring felt amazing; like nothing he had ever experienced. However the ring then began to reject him. Ghosts emerged from it and threw him backwards, causing him to drop the ring. Ryo ran to his assistance, but he remained concerned about the ring, so Ryo got up to fetch it. However the ring then accepted Ryo as its owner and infused itself into his body, causing  Dark Bakura  to reside within him. [1] 
 Ryo tried not to remember the incident in Egypt. [1]  He claimed that his father acquired the ring from an antiques shop in Egypt. [4] 
 Since the incident, Dark Bakura would secretly take control of Ryo's body. This caused bad things happened to people around him, resulting in Ryo living away from the rest of his family, including his father. [5] 
 Bakura's father came to be the owner of  Domino City Museum , a privilege Dark Bakura was able to exploit to set up the  Shadow RPG . [2]
