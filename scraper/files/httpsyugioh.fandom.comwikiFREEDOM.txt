 Kizutsuki sono tabini yasashiku nareru
 
 You get hurt and each time you get kinder.
 
 Getting hurt all those times became easy to get used to
 
 
 Tachiagaru soshite kimi wa tsuyosa wo shiru
 
 You stand up and learn how strong you are.
 
 Stand up and then you will know of your strength
 
 
 furi mukazu hashiite yuku no sa
 
 Rushing past with out turning back.
 
 Turn around and run away from death
 
 
 kako mo mirai mo ima ni tsunagatteru
 
 All leading to the past, future and present.
 
 The past, future, and present are all connected together
 
 
 osoreru koto nante nai sa
 
 There's nothing to be afraid of.
 
 Don't be afraid of what isn't there
 
 
 nandodemo iu yo kimi wa hitori ja nai
 
 I'll say it over and over. You are not alone.
 
 It's been said many times before: you are not alone
 
 
 mune ni himeta atsui omoi wa
 
 My innermost, passionate feelings are
 
 Hidden in my heart, my passionate feelings are
 
 
 mugen no mirai e to kakete yuku
 
 racing towards a boundless future
 
 Dreams of the future and the risk of death
 
 
 ugoki hajimeta yume wa genkai sae koete
 
 My dreams start turning and I can even push it past the limit,
 
 The dream has began to move, with the limits already heard
 
 
 michi biku darou mabayui hikari no sasu basho e
 
 paving the way to where the dazzling light shined upon.
 
 The road leading to that place seems to me to bestruck with dazzlingly bright light.
