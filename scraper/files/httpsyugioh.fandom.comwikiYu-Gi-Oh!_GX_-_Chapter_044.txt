 King Atticus's True Power!! 
 
 "King Rhodie!!" , known as  "King Fubuki!!"  in the Japanese version, is the forty-fourth chapter of the  Yu-Gi-Oh! GX  manga . It was first printed in Japanese in the  V Jump  magazine and in English in the  Shonen Jump  magazine. Both of which were printed in  volume 6  of the  Yu-Gi-Oh! GX  graphic novels afterwards.
 The American students  arrive at  Duel Academy . One of them,  James Crocodile Cook , seeks out and confronts  Atticus , challenging him to a  Duel . Meanwhile,  Jaden  finishes building his new Deck.
 
 Summary 
 Jaden  is very excited, having just completed building a new Deck. He finishes the Deck with " Winged Kuriboh ", while he places " Elemental Hero Terra Firma " into a Deck case full of cards. He leaves that case on his desk and puts his new Deck into another case, which he puts in his jacket pocket.  Syrus  rushes into the room and informs Jaden that the American students have arrived.
 Jesse ,  Axel ,  Adrian  and  James  step off their helicopter onto the grounds of  Duel Academy .  Principal MacKenzie  joins them, telling them to enjoy themselves, while he does the same in his own way.  Tragoedia  mentally hopes that they don't disappoint him and put on a fine show.
 Midori  has a conversation with her mother over the phone, who tells her to inform her if anything else comes up. She later teaches her class, and is livid to see Jaden asleep during it. Elsewhere across campus,  Alexis  plays baseball in gym class,  Bastion  sits in  the video room  and  Chazz  attends Professor  Sartyr 's class.
 MacKenzie meets with  Chancellor Sheppard  and introduces his students. He tells him that each of them competed in and won various tournaments sponsored by  KaibaCorp  and  Industrial Illusions , along with  David ,  Reggie  and  Aster Phoenix . Sheppard asks where the fifth student is, and MacKenzie replies that Aster is currently competing in a world tournament in Korea, but will arrive later.
 Later, James looks out the window in his room and sees  Atticus  approach Reggie. She tells him she's going back to her dorm and that she doesn't want to see her father. Atticus recalls Jaden and Midori telling him that she has lost her memory after he  Duel  with Jaden concluded. James confronts Atticus in  the forest  and says he was lucky to find Atticus so soon after arriving. Atticus tells him he has no idea who he is and that he wouldn't remember anyway since James is not a woman. James tells him that he wished to get revenge on David, but Atticus beat him to the punch. He challenges Atticus as a proxy instead, tossing him an  Academia Disk . Atticus accepts and the Duel begins.
