 This card can be searched by " A Cat of Ill Omen ", " Primathmech Alembertian ", " Trap Trick ", " Lilith, Lady of Lament ", " Traptrix Myrmeleo " and " Traptrix Sera ". 
 This card is best used to hit stronger monsters that  cannot be destroyed by card effects , making them more vulnerable to being destroyed in battle. Although " Floodgate Trap Hole " tends to be better, it fails against  Link Monsters , and if the monster's DEF is too high, it may not be enough to remove the monster without an effect.
