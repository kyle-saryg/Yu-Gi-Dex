 Duelist Instinct!! 
 
 "Deck of Fate!!"  is the eleventh chapter of the  Yu-Gi-Oh! GX  manga . It was first printed in Japanese in the  V Jump  magazine and in English in the  Shonen Jump  magazine. Both of which were printed in  volume 2  of the  Yu-Gi-Oh! GX  graphic novels afterwards.
 
 Summary 
 The flashbacks from  Jaden Yuki 's childhood continue, as Jaden rushes after the ambulance carrying  Koyo Hibiki , as  Chazz Princeton  watches on. Koyo is unconscious and sees a memory in his mind. He's lost a duel to a duelist shrouded in black shadow, who states that the duel was a "Game of Death". However, it states that just outright killing him would be boring, so he instead curses him. Each time Koyo  draws  a card when he is dueling seriously, a "card" from the "Deck of his life" will be depleted as well. The shadowed duelist urges him to stay alive so that they can duel again in the future. He then erases Koyo's memory of the encounter, though he now appears to have recalled it while unconscious.
 Koyo awakens, having reached the hospital. He recalls having a nightmare, but cannot recall what it was.  Midori  is at his bedside and she goes to speak with Jaden, who is outside the door. Jaden blames himself for Koyo's collapse, as Koyo participated in the tournament so that Jaden could see him as a true duelist. Midori meets with the doctor, who reveals that the scans turned up nothing in most cases. During a single scan, a small black shadow was blotched onto Koyo's brain stem, the area where control of breathing and the heart is housed. However, this shadow failed to appear in subsequent scans. Despite this, they can detect no actual abnormalities.
 Jaden apologizes for missing the tournament, and Koyo mentions the red costume he wore, which Midori dislikes due to how bright the red is. Koyo instructs Jaden to build the best Deck that he can by Sunday. On that day, Koyo will duel Jaden with his real Deck, so it will be a serious duel. After Jaden departs to build his Deck, Koyo tells Midori that he intends to retire for good after his duel with Jaden concludes. Jaden arrives on Sunday, and Midori gifts him with a  Duel Disk . Jaden is worried that it must have been an expensive gift, and Midori tells him not to worry about it. They go to roof, where Koyo is waiting to begin.
 Koyo urges Jaden to have fun  dueling , and takes the first  turn . He  Summons  " Elemental Hero Voltic " in  Attack Position  and  equips  it with " Voltic Spear " to give it a 1000-point attack boost, before  Setting  a card. Jaden is impressed by the holograms, and begins his turn. He Summons " Elemental Hero Bubbleman ". Midori comments that Jaden's best Deck is also of " Elemental Heroes " and that a Hero showdown is about to begin.
