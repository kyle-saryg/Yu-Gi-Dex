 Summary 
 Dark Signers meeting 
 A council of  Dark Signers  are aware that one of the two target  Signers ,  Yusei Fudo , has engaged in a Duel with one of their members.
 
 The Duel field 
 Carly Carmine  arrives on the scene of Yusei and  the Dark Signer's  Duel. After catching her breath, she is puzzled by the purple wall of light around the Duel, but assumes it could be the  Solid Vision . She spots Yusei, grabs her camera and begins to think up headlines. She sees the  glow  on Yusei's arm, but also notices his opponent has  one too .
 
       Yusei's trap negated.     
 After Yusei is thrown back by an attack from " Frozen Fitzgerald ", she begins to doubt that the Solid Vision that is causing the strange behavior.
 Yusei asks his opponent if he's a Signer. As this goes unanswered, Yusei vows to fight him with the belief in his cards, regardless of who this guy is.
 As Yusei faces difficulty with the effect of "Frozen Fitzgerald", his opponent reveals himself to be a Dark Signer as he states that together with his  dark mark , a Dark Signer can come back as many times as he wishes. He claims that before long, Yusei's  Mark of the Dragon  will be dyed pitch black.
 Not tolerating his opponent, Yusei explains that when he duels, neither the bonds with his friends or the hope of victory vanish from the field, until the end of the end, after asked about the effect of " Sonic Chick ". With that in mind, the Dark Signer attempts to simply take out his  Life Points  instead. He uses " Drain Strike " to allow "Fitzgerald" to get at Yusei's Life Points, while unable to destroy "Sonic Chick".
 With Yusei so far behind in Life Points, Carly foresees a great scoop. The Dark Signer sees Yusei's low Life Points as an indication of the fate he depends on and informs him that  Satellite  is nearing its hour of destruction, but believes Yusei will be unable to witness it.
 Enraged, Yusei quickly fills up his field with four monsters and uses them to  Synchro Summon  " Nitro Warrior ". He  equips  it with " Junk Barrage ". Using the effect of "Frozen Fitzgerald" effect to his advantage, Yusei attacks it twice with "Nitro Warrior". The  Battle Damage  combined with the  Effect Damage  from "Junk Barrage" takes out all of his opponent's Life Points.
 
 After the Duel 
       Carly, Yusei and Grady after the Duel.     
 Carly is impressed with how the new King duels, but is more so pleased that she managed to get an exclusive scoop on this action.
 Yusei rushes over to his opponent demanding answers. But the boy has no recollection of what just happened. Yusei notices his dark mark has vanished. Carly rushes over, recognizing Yusei's opponent as  Grady , now that his hood has been tossed off.
 After Carly is introduced to Yusei she takes out her microphone to interview him. A glowing spider flees from Grady's body and his Deck begins to glow for a second. Yusei and Carly turn to him. Carly tries to ask him a few questions, but Yusei looks at Grady's Deck. He notices both the  Dark Synchro  and  Dark Tuner monsters  have disappeared.
 
       The spider leaves Grady.     
 Carly tries forcing some memory out of Grady. After telling him to follow that "mental thread", the word "thread" reminds him of seeing thread shortly before he blacked out. Although unaware to him, that thread was a line of web that let the spider into him, back when he was listening to the Dark Signers preaching.
 
         Carly and Grady give themselves up to Sector Security.     
 The three of them hear  Sector Security  approach. Yusei gets up and flees, leaving the other two. Carly tries to follow him, but Grady catches her by the ankle causing to her fall forward. He asks her not to leave him. Carly's camera slides away from her over to the Securities. One of them picks it up and points to a car that was tossed onto another as a result of the Duel and asks if they're responsible. Carly frantically shakes her head and immediately puts her hands up. Grady's arms follow suit.
 
 
 Other reactions to the Duel 
 A spider dark mark missing two legs is shown. One of the legs reappears.  The owner  pulls his glove over the mark on his arm. They deduce that one of their target Signers got away. However, they're not too worried as they anticipate the Signers will soon be caught in their web.
 A spider hangs from a piece of web over Jack's hospital bed.
 Yusei returns to the hideout and reports what happened to  Tanner .
 Rex Goodwin  watches Yusei and Grady's Duel on a monitor. He dismisses it as he is contacted by  another man  on a screen behind him. Goodwin was aware the Dark Signers would appear. The  other man  asks Goodwin if he'll be okay.
 
 Satellite 
         The Dark Signers preaching in Satellite.     
 In Satellite, two figures in Dark Signer regalia start preaching about hope for Satellite. They say that the  Crimson Dragon  that appeared in  New Domino City  is a wicked god who will bring disaster to this world; Those gathered round them will be saved from this. The threads from a large web above them drop onto these people too. The people begin to chant against the Crimson Dragon.
 Rally  and  Nervin  appear carrying shopping bags. Rally tells the group to quit this. Nervin tries to calm him down, but Rally continues and tells them that Yusei is now King; A Duel King has been born out of Satellite; The Crimson Dragon appeared during Yusei's Duel and he's sure it brings good luck. Nervin covers Rally's mouth. The crowd menacingly approach Rally and Nervin. Nervin tells Rally that they shouldn't get involved like this. Rally argues that it's the truth and tells the crowd to check for themselves.  Blister  watches them in secret as they do this.
 Back at their base, Rally looks up an article about Yusei, but is angered because it refers at him as "the alleged King", and implies that he cheated during the duel.  Blitz ,  Tank  and Nervin aren't impressed either, knowing that the inhabitants of Neo Domino City never give anyone born in Satellite a chance. Blister enters their joint, telling them that he's been looking for them.
 
 Security building 
         Carly reads Angela's article.     
 Carly is enraged that  Angela  didn't get one comment from Yusei, but she's wrote a "half-baked" article. A man opens a door and calls in to Carly to keep quiet until her turn to be questioned.
 Carly draws another card, " Fortune Fairy Chee ", from her Fortune Telling Deck, which says her fortune for today is "super pinch", but she might gain an edge over her competition, so cheer up. Angrily she asks how she's supposed to cheer up in here of all places. The man opens the door and yells at Carly to keep quiet again.
 
 Trudge's confrontation 
 At Blister's hideout, Yusei still hasn't heard from Blister about his friends since they were aid to be released. Worried about what he's heard about Satellite, Yusei plans to go back.  Leo  and  Luna  advise against this as it's too dangerous and Yusei had said Signers should stick together. Yusei walks over to them and says that Signers are always bound to meet again.
 A number of Securities appear outside the building, lead by  Trudge . Trudge calls Yusei a Satellite scumbag and says that the city is no safe refuge for him. Himuro/Tanner calls this bad timing, but Yusei sees it as quite the opposite. He walks out to Trudge and says he needs to speak with  Rex Goodwin  anyway.
 
 Featured Duel: Grady vs. Yusei Fudo 
 ... continued from last episode. 
 Turn 3: Grady 
Grady has just managed to Dark Synchro Summon " Frozen Fitzgerald ". He then activates the effect of " Dark Tuner Catastrogue " to  destroy  " Junk Warrior " as "Dark Tuner Catastrogue" was used for a Dark Synchro Summon. "Frozen Fitzgerald" attacks directly. Yusei tries to activate his face-down " Descending Lost Star ", but due to the first effect of "Frozen Fitzgerald", Yusei can't activate Spell or Trap Cards when it attacks until the end of the Damage Step. The direct attack continues (Yusei 3700 → 1200).
 Turn 4: Yusei 
Yusei  draws  " Turret Warrior ". He then activates his face-down "Descending Lost Star" to  Special Summon  "Junk Warrior" in  Defense Position  with its effects negated, its DEF reduced to 0, and its Level reduced by one (2300/1300 → 0; Level 5 → 4). Yusei then  Tributes  "Junk Warrior" in order to Special Summon "Turret Warrior" (1200/2000) in  Attack Position . 
 Since Yusei Special Summoned "Turret Warrior" by Tributing a Warrior-type monster, it gains ATK equal to the ATK of "Junk Warrior" ("Turret Warrior": 1200 → 3500/2000). "Turret Warrior" attacks and destroys "Frozen Fitzgerald" (Grady 4000 → 3000). Grady activates the second effect of "Frozen Fitzgerald" to revive it (2500/2500) in Defense Position. 
 At the end of the  Battle Phase , the third effect of "Frozen Fitzgerald" destroys "Turret Warrior". Yusei activates " One for One " to send " Quillbolt Hedgehog " from his hand to the Graveyard and Special Summon " Sonic Chick " (300/300) in Defense Position.
 Turn 5: Grady 
Grady draws "Drain Strike". He then switches "Frozen Fitzgerald" to Attack Position. Grady then equips "Frozen Fitzgerald" with " Drain Strike ", which grants "Frozen Fitzgerald" the ability to inflict halved piercing damage. "Frozen Fitzgerald" attacks "Sonic Chick". "Sonic Chick" is not destroyed due to its effect, but "Frozen Fitzgerald" inflicts halved piercing damage to Yusei (Yusei 1200 → 100). "Drain Strike" then increases Grady's Life Points by the damage Yusei took (Grady 3000 → 4100). Grady's hand contains " De-Synchro " and " Pot of Avarice ".
 Turn 6: Yusei 
Yusei draws " Nitro Synchron " and subsequently  Normal Summons  it (300/100) in Attack Position. He then Special Summons "Quillbolt Hedgehog" (800/800) from his Graveyard in Attack Position via its own effect (as he controls a Tuner Monster). Yusei then activates his face-down " Graceful Revival " to Special Summon " Speed Warrior " (900/400) from his Graveyard in Attack Position. 
 Yusei then tunes "Speed Warrior", "Quillbolt Hedgehog", and "Sonic Chick" with "Nitro Synchron" in order to  Synchro Summon  " Nitro Warrior " (2800/1800) in Attack Position. Since "Speed Warrior" has been removed from the field, "Graceful Revival" is destroyed and due to the effect of "Quillbolt Hedgehog", the latter is removed from play. 
 Yusei then draws a card (" Junk Barrage ") due to the effect of "Nitro Synchron". Yusei then equips "Junk Barrage" to "Nitro Warrior". Now when "Nitro Warrior" destroys a monster in battle and sends it to the Graveyard, Grady will take damage equal to half of the destroyed monster's ATK. 
 "Nitro Warrior" then attacks "Frozen Fitzgerald". The first effect of "Nitro Warrior" activates, increasing its ATK by 1000 ("Nitro Warrior": 2800 → 3800/1800). "Nitro Warrior" then destroys "Frozen Fitzgerald". (Grady 4100 → 2800). The effect of "Junk Barrage" activates (Grady 2800 → 1550). After damage calculation, the first effect of "Nitro Warrior" expires ("Nitro Warrior": 3800 → 2800/1800). 
 Grady activates the second effect of "Frozen Fitzgerald" to revive it (2500/2500) in Defense Position. Grady intends for Yusei to end his Battle Phase, so that the third effect of "Frozen Fitzgerald" will destroy "Nitro Warrior". This will allow Grady to attack directly with "Frozen Fitzgerald" during his next turn. Yusei then activates the second effect of "Nitro Warrior" to switch "Frozen Fitzgerald" to Attack Position and let "Nitro Warrior" attack it. "Nitro Warrior" then attacks and destroys "Frozen Fitzgerald" (Grady 1550 → 1250). The effect of "Junk Barrage" then activates (Grady 1250 → 0).
 
 Differences in adaptations 
         An example of "lorum ipsum" in  Yu-Gi-Oh! 5D's .     
 In the English dub, the "REC" in the camera view from Carly's camera is replaced with a ● recording symbol. 
 In the English dub, the scene where  Carly Carmine  shivers from the cold of the attack from " Frozen Fitzgerald " is cut. 
 In the original, when Dick announces that "Frozen Fitzgerald" revives itself after being destroyed by "Nitro Warrior", this is followed by a shot of Yusei grimacing before the eyecatch, with Dick's dialogue and "Frozen Fitzgerald"'s resurrection repeated when the second half of the episode starts. Due to the commercial break in the English dub not occurring at this point, the shot of Yusei, alongside Grady's repeated dialogue, are removed. 
 In the English dub, the scenes showing drunk people at a place called "Jim's Bar" are cut. 
 In the English dub, Angela's article is changed to Latin with all the Latin in different terms of translation, font, lines, and style of the letters than the original Japanese text.  The same "Latin" paragraph is repeated all over the article.  The top title, the part of the site it is on, and the Japanese kana, as well as part of the monitor's frame are erased as well. The exact Latin passage is: "Suspendisse potenti. Suspendisse se mper viverra diam. Vestibulum porta neque sed enim. Fusce pellentesque aliquam risus. Pellentesque tempus mollis felis. Integer mauris. Mauris dictum, nibh id lobortis euismod, lac us felis ornare nisi ut vul utate nunc." This was most likely created via a  lorem ipsum  generator. 
 In the original when Trudge arrives to pick Yusei up, Tanner doesn't think this is good, but Yusei says it's the opposite (in the dub Tanner says in disbelief that Trudge is his protection, to which Yusei said he was more than that and they just may have to count him as one of the good guys). 
 
 Mistakes 
         "Nitro Warrior" mistakenly displayed on Yusei's Duel Disk in the original Japanese episode.     
 In the English dub, after Yusei  Tributes  " Junk Warrior " to Summon " Turret Warrior " and explains its effect, he oddly says, "Let's see your darkness stand up to 20,000 watts of light!" as the ATK of "Turret Warrior" increases (even though "Turret Warrior" has nothing to do with light, and it only gained 2300 ATK). 
 In the original episode, after Yusei Normal Summons " Junk Synchron " and activates its effect, a scene shows that " Nitro Warrior " is on his Duel Disk. The English dub does not rectify this, but rather replaces the card with "Junk Warrior". 
 In the English dub, when Yusei looks through Grady's Deck, there is a " Karate Man " with at least 5  Level  Stars visible. 
 In one scene,  Devack 's Dark Signer robes are erroneously colored red, instead of yellow. This is fixed in subsequent shots.
