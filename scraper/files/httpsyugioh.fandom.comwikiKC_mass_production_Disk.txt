 Characteristics 
         The Duel Disk unfolded when in use and folded when not in use.     
         The manga's Duel Disk functions are described in detail.     
 Unlike the previous Duel Disk, it did not need to be thrown. When it first appeared in the anime, sealers flew out of the Duel Disk to the sides of the Dueling area to produce the  Solid Vision  holograms. These were removed later; by the Battle City Finals, as they did not deploy of the blimp the quarter finals took place. In the manga the holograms were projected straight from the Duel Disk itself.
 The  Monster Card Zone  is along an arm blade. The  Spell & Trap Card Zone  is a series of slots behind each Monster Zone. In the anime, the blade could be folded up when not in use. In the manga, it could not be folded up, nor do the sealers that produce the Solid Vision make an appearance. In the manga, there is no Spell & Trap Card Zone slots, but instead the Monster Card Zone serves an all purpose for every card; whether this limits to a maximum of five cards on the field per player or not is not determined.
 Directly underneath each  monster  slot is another slot for  Spell  and  Trap Cards . If a Duelist was to activate a  Set  card, they would activate a button on the round portion of the disk. Another slot can open on the front end of the disk that is used for the  Field Spell Card . The center of the disk includes the  Main Deck  and  Graveyard  slot and  Life Point  counter. The bottom part of the Disk, which goes around the user's arm, also contains a retractable cable that could be attached to  Dueling Arenas  if one player opted not to use a Duel Disk.
 In the manga, the Duel Disk has a Duelist Search System, which is the pointed shape located on top of the Graveyard. It reacts to other Duel Disks in the vicinity. In  Yu-Gi-Oh! Chapter 178 ,  Katsuya Jonouchi  used the Duelist Search System to find his next opponent. The sensor started beeping because a Duelist was 50 meters within its range and led Jonouchi to the Aquarium where  Ryota Kajiki  resided. This function and scene was not adapted in the anime.

 The Disk is able to eject cards the Duelist wants into their hand.
 
 History 
 Prior to the  Battle City  Tournament,  KaibaCorp  developed the second generation Duel Disk, the first one to be released to the public, which were issued to the participants of  Battle City . Originally, only those of eligible ranks to participate in Battle City (at least Level 5 out of 8 stars in the original, or at least 4 out of 5 stars in the dub) could apply for a Duel Disk. After the tournament was over, the device was distributed to public. The disk accepted  counterfeit  cards printed and used by the  Rare Hunters ; whether this is an oversight or intentional is unclear, but Kaiba did mention that one of the reasons for the tournament is to flush out the Rare Hunters, so the latter is probable.
 These Duel Disks were the only model used until  Doma  used the  Chaos Duel Disk .
 
         Richie's unique Black Disk.     
 In  Yu-Gi-Oh! R ,  Richie Merced  wielded a Black Disk, a special one-of-the-kind Duel Disk that only the strongest individual of the  Card Professors Guild  is allowed to wield. It is a KC mass production Disk with jet black colors, produced by  Yako Tenma .  Keith Howard  defeated Richie and took the Disk for himself, only to lose a duel (and the Disk) to  Katsuya Jonouchi , who gave it to  Tilla Mook  as returning the Duel Disk he borrowed from her earlier. Tenma installed an anti-cheat alarm onto the device, making it unable to accept cards that were not drawn from the Deck, as Keith found out when he attempted to sneak a " Ring of Destruction " from his wristband onto the zone.
 In  Yu-Gi-Oh! GX  these Duel Disks were used by the students at  Duel Academy  prior to being given the  Academia Disks .
 In  Yu-Gi-Oh! 5D's , this version of the Duel Disk was used by citizens of  Satellite , while the people in  New Domino City  used more modern versions.  Yusei Fudo  uses a modified version of this Disk, while  Jack Atlas 's Disk resembles this one in style, but with a straight edge.
 In  Yu-Gi-Oh! ARC-V , this model of Duel Disk was seen being used by the people of the  Standard Dimension  before  Leo Akaba  reinvented the  ARC System . [1] 
 In  Yu-Gi-Oh! VRAINS , the body of the Duel Disk used by  Yusaku Fujiki  is similar to this model.
 
 Real world 
         Mattel's Duel Disk 2     
 The toy company Mattel produced replicas of this Duel Disk. There are a couple of notable differences between the Mattel Duel Disk and its fictional counterpart. Spell and Trap Cards are loaded into the bottom of the blade (the opposite side to the anime version). Most notably, it cannot project holographic images. Also, the edge is not shaped like a blade.
 While the toy Duel Disk was advertised as being compatible with the TCG, there are a few flaws that make this impractical:
 
 Most players used card protectors to prevent  damage  to their cards. Cards in protectors will not fit into the Duel Disk. Unprotected cards may get corner damage from the monster holding tabs on the blade's upper face if not used carefully. 
 The  Deck Zone  can only hold about 50 to 59 cards safely. The  Academy Duel Disk  can hold 65 cards in total. While most players stick to the minimum, there are those who use bigger Decks and cannot use the Duel Disk. Though, the new rules made a maximum of 60 cards making the limited holding capacity problem moot. 
 The  Graveyard  can only hold about 20 cards. This would present a problem when playing against someone who relies on running an opponents Deck out. 
 No place for the  Fusion Deck  or  banished  cards.
 This is also true in the anime, as banished cards are often seen placed into the Duelist's pockets. 
 The  Life Points  counter can only go up to 9990 life points. While both players start with 8000, 4000 or 2000, it could rise to 9000 or 10,000+ Life Points due to card effects. The reason for the zero at the end is because while there are four buttons on the disk, only 3 of them change the counter, the last one lights up the display. This also serves the problem that some cards can cause the  Life Points  in the ones place to be a number different than zero. 
 The way the Duel Disk moves from stand-by to in use is also different. In the anime, the  Graveyard  is locked over the Deck and the two field parts are retracted into the main part of the disk. When triggered, the field parts and graveyard are unlocked and the central piece rotates the graveyard and field into play position. The toy however does not have a rotating center and the two halves of the field aren't locked in closer to the central piece. When the player triggers the toy into play mode, the smaller half of the field, which is spring loaded, is released from its lock at the same time as the larger half which has a weaker spring, and thus, the smaller part pushes the larger part into play position.
