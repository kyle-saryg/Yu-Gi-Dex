 Alector is the name of the father of Leitus, one of the acclaimed Argonauts. Homer, however, called him "Alectryon" in the story. 
 Alector ("Aλέκτωρ") in Ancient Greek means rooster, referencing this card's birdlike appearance. 
 In  Yu-Gi-Oh! 5D's World Championship 2010: Reverse of Arcadia  this card is named as "Divine Fowl King Alector" while in the description reads "Divine Bird King Alector". 
 This could also be a reference to  Alecto  from Greek Mythology. Since Alecto's duty was to punish sinners, this card's effect to negate others and to  Special Summon  itself could be a reference to her abilities, along with its bird-like appearance. 
 This card shares an odd distinction with " Elemental HERO Absolute Zero " and " Kachi Kochi Dragon ": They are all promo cards for manga volumes in which they do not appear.
 Of the three, this card is unique in that it not only does not show up in the volume it was a promo for, but it does not show up in its respective manga series at all.
