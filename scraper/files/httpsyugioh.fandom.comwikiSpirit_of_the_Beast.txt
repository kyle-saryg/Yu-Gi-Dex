 "  Ritual Beast Ulti-Apelio  " 
 A Fusion Monster that can be Special Summoned from the Extra Deck by banishing 1 " Ritual Beast Tamer " and 1 " Spiritual Beast "!
When this monster attacks, it is not affected by other card effects until the end of the Damage Step!
In addition, you can return this card to your Extra Deck to Special Summon 1 banished "Ritual Beast Tamer" monster and 1 banished "Spiritual Beast" monster.

 "  Spiritual Beast Tamer Winda  " 
 When this monster is destroyed by your opponent, you can Special Summon 1 " Ritual Beast " monster from your Extra Deck, ignoring its Summoning conditions!

 "  Yosenjus' Sword Sting  " 
 This Trap Card is very important in " Yosenju " Decks!
If you control no monster, you can reveal up to 2 "Yosenju" monsters with different names in your hand, then return the same number of face-up cards your opponent controls to the hand.
"Yosenju" return to the hand at the end of the turn they are Summoned, so use this card when your opponent Summons monsters on his turn!
 
 "  Divine Wind of Mist Valley  " 
 This card lets you Special Summon a Level 4 or lower WIND monster from your Deck when a face-up WIND monster you control is returned to your hand!
