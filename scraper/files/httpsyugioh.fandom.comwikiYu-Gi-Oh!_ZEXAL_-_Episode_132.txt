 Summary 
 Vector  declares that's its time for the shocking truth. Using his  Ray  voice, he reveals that it was he who killed  Nash  and  Marin  when they were in the  Barian World .  Dumon  mutters Marin's name, while Marin herself screams "VECTOR!" as blue energy swirls around here (these events are cut from the dub, as they took place in the previous episode; the dub instead created its own recap). She tells him she'll slice every last one of his  Life Points  away this turn. Vector tells her to try if she really can, reminding her that if he even has one left, it will all be dealt to her as  damage . He adds that he's quivering at having the chance send her to Hell again. Dumon tells Vector to be silent and says he cannot let his deeds go unpunished after such a betrayal, his fist clenching in anger. Marin tells Dumon she'll send Vector to Hell no matter what it may take (in the dub, she says she knows how to defeat Vector, but it's a risky move). Dumon seems to realize what Marin has in mind as she  activates  " Distortion Crystal ". She explains that as she  controls  a  WATER   monster , any modifications to the  ATK  of opponent's monsters will be doubled this  turn . She then activates " Zero Blade ", which will reduce the ATK of " Number 43: Manipulator of Souls " by 1000. The two cards merge into one and then fire a blue beam at "Manipulator of Souls", the end result being a decrease in ATK of 2000, to 1500. Vector tells her she should just die (in the dub, Vector calls Marin a "clever girl"), but Marin says she is not done yet. 
 
       " Number C103: Ragnafinity " throws its scythe.     
 Marin activates the  effect  of " Chaos Number 103: Ragnafinity ",  detaching  an  Chaos Overlay Unit  to deal damage to Vector equal to the change in his monster's ATK. Vector yells, "WHAT!?", while Marin declares " Moonblade Blitz " and "Ragnafinity" shoots a pink beam from its scythe, which blasts Vector backwards. As he struggles to rise to his feet, he comments that she has some nerve, but reminds her that one  battle  with "Manipulator of Souls" won't take away the rest of his Life Points. She asks if he's sure about that and reveals that "Zero Blade" will also allow "Ragnafinity" to  attack  twice this turn. Vector yells "WHAT!?" again and Marin asks Vector to let her repay him for he did to she and Nash. She says the first strike is for her and orders "Ragnafinity" to attack. 
 
         " Damage Pot " absorbs the damage.     
 It twirls its scythe around before throwing it, severing the puppet strings connecting " Number 96: Dark Mist " to "Manipulator of Souls" and reducing Vector to 700 Life Points as he flies backwards again. As "Dark Mist" reforms and the strings reappear, Marin remarks that "Manipulator of Souls" can't be  destroyed by battle  if it has a " Number "  equipped , but Vector will still take damage. She declares she can attack again and that this is the end for Vector, adding that this second strike is for Nash (she does not say this in the dub). The scythe rips into "Manipulator of Souls" itself this time, but Vector activates his  face-down  " Damage Pot ", which  negates  the damage done. As "Dark Mist" reforms again, "Damage Pot" takes in the blast, laughing. 
 
       Don Thousand 's advice saves  Vector .     
 Dumon is surprised he managed to absorb the damage, while Vector chuckles that Marin wasn't able to get rid of all of his Life Points, and proceeds to declare the effect of " Don Thousand's Throne ". He floats in the pink sphere again as his Life Points are restored and Nash screams in pain, his energy being drained. Vector thanks Nash for the tune-up. His Life Points at 4000, he reminds them that the effect of "Manipulator of Souls" will increase its ATK by the Life Points he gained and inflict that damage to his opponent's Life Points. He asks if he should send her to Hell now. Laughing, he begins to activate the effect, but  Don Thousand  tells him to stop. Thousand says that if they change the ATK, the effect of "Ragnafinity" will cause them to take damage too. Vector points out it would only do 3300 damage, but Thousand asks if he forgot that "Distortion Crystal" will double that. 
 Marin asks him what's wrong - isn't he going to use the effect? She adds he must have realized that she was the one that was about to send him to Hell. Vector tells she would still take the damage too. She responds that that was her intent. Dumon comments that he was right - she intends to tie the Duel. She angrily states once again that she will do whatever it takes to send Vector to Hell. Vector cancels the effect activation and Marin quips that his invincible combo was broken - no matter how much he claims to be a God, even his power has limits (in the dub, Marin calls Vector a coward). Vector tells her to shut up, adding that they are just a couple of bugs who don't realize their place. Marin says he's just making excuses and ends her turn (in the dub, Marin chides Vector for not showing respect as a leader, something Nash has done). Vector is irate that she's just toying with him like this. Using Ray's voice again, he says its time for another round of the shocking truth (in the dub, Vector decides to show Marin and Dumon how Nash is faring). A screen materializes it front of Dumon and Marin, through which they can see Nash's predicament. Vector boasts he used that oaf  Girag  to trap him. Enraged, Dumon calls Vector an "odious cur", but asks why he's doing this (in the dub, Vector does not mention Girag, but remarks that Nash has seen better days; Dumon orders Vector to release their leader). Vector tells them to take a good look at Nash (in the dub, Vector refuses to release Nash, stating that he prefers him bound and beaten). As the two look closer, their eyes widen. Vector asks if they understand yet - Nash is down in the dumps, but Vector is walking on cloud nine. He quips that to keep restoring his Life Points as he has been, he had to take the energy from somewhere. Floored, Dumon says this can't be and calls Vector a fiend (in the dub, Dumon exclaims that Vector drew his energy from Nash). Vector is surprised that they've only just realized what was happening - it's really them that have been slowly killing Nash.
 
         Alito  realizes he can no longer use his " Over-Hundred Number ".     
 The  Different Dimension Airship  had entered " Sargasso the Different Dimension Battlefield " when Girag attacked it. Standing atop " Number 106: Giant Hand ", he asks if  Alito  has really stabbed them in the back and joined with the enemy. He adds that Alito would have to be a fool to defy Don Thousand.  Yuma  tries to explain that Girag has been tricked, with  Tori  adding that Don Thousand has modified his memory. Girag tells them not to even attempt to trick him with such lies. He boasts that he'll take their rotten souls, squish them together and then eat them himself (in the dub, Girag calls his enemies' statements a bad move; he will have to put the hurt on them). Yuma tries to continue, but Alito advises him not to even bother. He determines that they'll have to break Don Thousand's curse the same way Yuma did with Alito himself.  Astral  agrees - they have no choice but to use the "Number" from Girag's  ruins  to destroy the " Over-Hundred Number " and break the spell. Yuma says they'll have to Duel then, but Alito insists that he be the one to do it. Alito stares at " Number 105: Battlin' Boxer Star Cestus " and says that after losing his  Barian  powers, he can't use his "Over-Hundred Number" anymore. 
 
         Don Thousand's power over  Girag .     
 Despite that handicap, Alito insists he must Duel - Girag is his best friend (in the dub, he adds that he can't let Girag be imprisoned by Don Thousand's power). He recalls how they bonded after Alito arrived on Earth. Yuma says he understands, but adds he'll need the "Number" then. He digs through his Deck box and hands Alito  a card , explaining its from Girag's ruins. Alito thanks him and Astral wishes Alito luck. Tori asks Alito to make sure he wins. Alito turns towards Girag, yelling that he'll be his opponent. Girag claims he'll enjoy eating the soul of this traitor and  Barian Battlemorphs , his  D-Pad  appearing on his arm. Alito vows to turn him back to normal no matter what it takes. He can no longer Battlemorph himself, but his D-Pad appears and one of his eyes glow a dark red. Alito goes first and  Normal Summons  " Battlin' Boxer Big Bandage " before  Setting  two cards. Girag tells Alito to come at him. He  draws  and  Don Thousand's Emblem  emanates out from him with a shriek. 
 
         Nash  watches on as  Dumon  declares his next move.     
 Marin stares in disbelief at the display, shocked that their attacks have been harming her brother. Nash's eye twitches in pain, while Marin falls to her knees, unsure of what to do. Dumon mutters her name, but then turns to Vector. He asks to know why he's being such a lowly coward. Laughing enthusiastically, Vector responds that it's because he just loves to see them suffer (in the dub, Dumon calls Vector a "vicious maniac"; Vector corrects him by calling himself an "inventive vicious maniac"). Dumon wonders if even Vector's soul is nothing but a rotten mire (in the dub, he calls Vector "sick and depraved"). Dumon draws and activates " Rank-Up-Magic - The Seventh One ",  Ranking Up  " Number 102: Star Seraph Sentry " and performing a  Chaos Xyz Evolution  to  Special Summon  " Number C102: Archfiend Seraph " in  Attack Position . Dumon boasts he'll defeat Vector with a single attack, win the Duel and save Nash. Nash hangs his head and mutters Dumon's name (in the dub, Nash encourages Dumon to win).
 
         " Archfiend Seraph " attacks.     
 Dumon activates the effect of the " Celestial Rage " in his  Graveyard ,  banishing  it to increase the ATK of "Archfiend Seraph" by 2000, to 4900. Vector points out that's still not enough for a victory, but Dumon tells him he's not done yet. He activates the effect of "Archfiend Seraph", explaining he can detach a Chaos Overlay Unit to negate the effects of a monster and decrease its ATK to 0. "Archfiend Seraph" shatters its Chaos Overlay Unit with its lance and then spins it around, firing a red burst of light at "Manipulator of Souls", who recoils as its ATK falls to 0. Vector once again yells "WHAT!?". Dumon continues that he'll take 4900 damage with this strike, now. Dumon adds that Vector should feel relieved though - Dumon will be coming with him to hell to ensure that he stays there. Vector asks what he means and Dumon clarifies that "Celestial Rage" will cause the  Battle Damage  to be inflicted to him as well. Marin mutters his name in concern, while Vector is shocked that he also plans to end this in a draw. Dumon orders "Archfiend Seraph" to attack "Manipulator of Souls", saying he and Vector will go to Hell together. "Archfiend Seraph" throws its lance, from which emerges two small demons. The lance becomes energy and the demons return to it as it gets closer to "Manipulator of Souls".
 Don Thousand appears and says "Now, Vector!" ("Play your Trap, fool!" in the dub), prompting Vector to activate his face-down " Evil 1 ". The attack hits and Vector explains his card's effect as he's blasted across the chamber again. This will prevent the destruction of his monster and change the damage to his current Life Points − 1, no matter how much damage he would have otherwise taken. Dumon grunts in pain as he's taken backwards as well due to "Celestial Rage". Vector mutters that that was way too close - any closer and they'd both be in Hell right now (in the dub, Vector taunts Dumon by saying he is a better Duelist). Dumon mutters that its just like Vector to have a card like that. Vector quips that it sucks to be Dumon, then and asks why he hasn't ended his turn yet. Hanging his head, Dumon does so and the ATK of "Archfiend Seraph" returns to normal. Vector declares the effect of "Don Thousand's Throne" and Dumon and Marin both yell Nash's name as his energy is drained and Vector's Life Points return to 4000. Vector tells them that's what they get for all their hard work (in the dub, Vector asks to turn the screaming down, since he is trying to win). Thousand asks if he had "Evil 1"  Set  just for this purpose. Vector confirms it, but says he didn't expect he'd need to use it (in the dub, Thousand remarks that he has had enough of Vector's foolishness, stating that had Vector not used his Trap, they would have lost; Vector replies that he knows what he's doing). 
 
         Girag prepares to  overlay  his  monsters .     
 Back at the Airship, Girag brings out " Chaos Number 106: Giant Red Hand ". Alito remarks that Girag dropped his ace quite quickly (Alito is silent at this point in the dub). Girag clarifies that he isn't done and Normal Summons " Fire Hand ". It appears above him and from its arm socket emerges another hand, which grasps his shoulder and causes electricity to crackle. Girag grunts, but Special Summons " Prominence Hand " from his hand, explaining he can do so when he controls a  FIRE  monster. It grasps his other shoulder, causing the same results. Girag  overlays  his two  Level  4 monsters to  Xyz Summon  " Number 58: Burner Visor " in Attack Position. Astral remarks that he can feel Don Thousand's power coming from that "Number". Yuma gasps and Astral adds that it'll make the curse over Girag even stronger. Girag activates the effect of "Burner Visor", detaching both Overlay Units to  equip  it to "Giant Red Hand". The massive hand grasps the ball that is "Burner Visor" and rears upward. Girag reveals that the monster equipped with "Burner Visor" can attack  directly . Girag tells Alito that this will be the end for him. 
 Back at the other Duel, Vector draws and then activates the second effect of "Evil 1",  sending  it to the Graveyard to  target  and destroy any card on the  field . Using his Ray voice again, Vector adds that he can't battle the turn he uses this effect. He wonders what card he should destroy, looking from "Archfiend Seraph" to "Ragnafinity" as Dumon and Marin simply stare. Vector finally decides to destroy his own "Damage Pot". Marin asks why he'd destroy his own  Trap Card  and Vector clarifies that when it  leaves the field , the damage it absorbed is inflicted to all players. Cracks form around the pot and it begins to shine as Vector reminds them that it sucked up 1300 damage earlier - so all players will take that damage now. He tells them both to have a fun trip to Hell, adding that he'll be just fine. Switching to his Ray voice again, he calls them "worms" (in the dub, Vector uses his normal voice throughout, and sings that his opponents won't survive; he will) and tells them good-bye. Dumon looks at Marin, muttering to himself as the pot explodes. Dumon activates his face-down " Sacred Shield ", which reduces the damage to 0. A shrinking blue  Sphere Field  forms around the explosion and vanishes. Dumon reveals that the effect will also increase the ATK of a  Fairy - Type  monster by the combined damage that was prevented. He chooses "Ragnafinity", so its ATK becomes 6700. Marin is ecstatic and tells Dumon that with ATK like that, they'll win during her next turn. 
 
         Dumon's final moments.     
 Dumon looks away from her and simply remarks "farewell" ("Not 'we', Marin. You." in the dub). Marin asks what he means. Dumon says that at the end of this turn, "Sacred Shield" will direct all the damage that was negated back to him. Marin asks why he'd do this, while Vector laughs. Dumon apologizes to Marin for being unable to defeat Vector, calling Marin "my lady". Dumon says that she and Nash were the two most important people in the world to him and he's happy he was able to meet them as both a human and a Barian. He tells Marin to be sure to beat Vector, while Vector ends his turn. A yellow energy blast hits him and he's taken off his feet, the chamber's flooring flying in chunks as he reverts to his human form. Marin screams his name, but he again remarks he was glad to have met her and Nash. His body glows with pink energy and he finally vanishes. Nash screams his name, while Marin reaches her hand towards where he stood. The energy of his soul gathers in a ball and floats towards Marin. 
 
         Alito's aura.     
 At the Airship, Girag declares his direct attack with "Giant Red Hand". A fiery tornado streams towards Alito, who screams and falls to the ground, his Life Points at 1400. Tori covers her eyes, while Alito says he's not down for the count yet. Girag laughs and boasts that he's not seen the worst of "Burner Visor" yet. Its effect lets him  discard  a card from his hand to inflict 500 damage to Alito. He discards " Ice Hand ", so another fiery tornado streams towards Alito. Yuma screams his name (in the dub, "This is trouble; hang in there!") as it hits him before he's even managed to get to his feet. His Life Points fall to 900, but now Girag discards " Reload ", inflicting another 500 damage. Girag laughs and adds that Alito should keep singing with those wonderful screams. Tori urges Girag to stop - this is too cruel (this quote is cut from the dub). Girag says this is the end and discards " The Judgement Hand ". Yuma screams Alito's name and Tori covers her mouth in horror. Managing to sit up, Alito activates his face-down " Hyper Burning ", which will let him halve his Life Points to reduce the damage to 0. Electricity crackles and his Life Points fall to 200, but a bubble shield protects him from the final fiery tornado. Girag yells "WHAT!?", while Alito jumps to his feet and yells that he'll show Girag a true burning heart - one that can burn even the hottest flame (in the dub, Alito says he can't be beaten while he's this fired up). Red energy emanates out from him, prompting Girag to cover his eyes. Astral remarks that even without his Barian powers, Alito is putting up a true fight. Yuma tells him he's the coolest, while Alito draws his card.
 
         Marin  sobs at Dumon's death.     
 Tears streaming down her face, Marin clasps Dumon's soul to her chest, saying she understands why he did this. With the power he died to give her, she'll be able to win. Getting to her feet, she points at Vector and tells him to prepare himself. Vector laughs, but Marin reminds him that "Ragnafinity" has 6700 ATK now - and the effects of "Manipulator of Souls" are still negated and its ATK is still 0. Vector's eye twitches and he recoils a bit. Marin draws and immediately orders her attack, yelling that she'll rip his Life Points to shreds with this strike. "Ragnafinity" throws its scythe, and "Manipulator of Souls" is engulfed in a explosion. Marin tells Dumon she's won - and she could have only done so thanks to the power he gave her. But as the smoke clears, Vector's laugh rings out derisively.
 
 Featured Duels 
 Marin and Dumon vs. Vector 
 Duel continues from  the previous episode . 
 
         The  effect  of " Number C103: Ragnafinity ".     
 Turn 5: Marin 
As she  controls  a  WATER   monster ,  Marin   activates  " Distortion Crystal ". Now, whenever the  ATK  of an opponent's monster is changed this  turn , the value it is changed by will be doubled. She then activates " Zero Blade " to target "Ragnafinity" and let it attack twice this turn as well as reduce the ATK of " Number 43: Manipulator of Souls " by 1000 ("Manipulator of Souls": 3500 → 1500 ATK). As the ATK of an opponent's monster was changed, Marin activates the effect of " Chaos Number 103: Ragnafinity " to  detach  a  Chaos Overlay Unit  ("Ragnafinity": 2 → 1 ORU) and inflict  damage  to the opponent equal to the difference between the previous and current ATK of "Manipulator of Souls" (Vector: 4000 →  2000 LP).
 "Ragnafinity" attacks "Manipulator of Souls", but the latter's third effect prevents its destruction (Vector: 2000 → 700 LP). "Ragnafinity" attacks "Manipulator of Souls" again, but  Vector  activates his  face-down   Continuous Trap Card  " Damage Pot ", which prevents both players from taking  Battle Damage  from this battle. "Manipulator of Souls" is once again not destroyed due to its third effect. On Marin's  End Phase , the first effect of " Don Thousand's Throne " activates (Vector: 700 → 4000 LP). Vector almost activates the fourth effect of "Manipulator of Souls", but Don Thousand stops him from doing so, as doing so would double the change and that would be used with "Ragnafinity"'s effect to defeat him.
 Turn 6: Dumon 
 Dumon  draws " Rank-Up-Magic - The Seventh One " and subsequently activates it to  Rank-Up  " Number 102: Star Seraph Sentry " via  Chaos Xyz Evolution  in order to  Xyz Summon  " Chaos Number 102: Archfiend Seraph " ( 5/2900/2400, ORU: 3) in  Attack Position . Dumon activates the effect of the " Celestial Rage " in his  Graveyard ,  banishing  it in order to increase the ATK of "Archfiend Seraph" by 2000 ("Archfiend Seraph": 2900 → 4900 ATK). However, the Battle Damage taken from  battles  involving it this turn will be inflicted to him as well. 
 Dumon activates the effect of "Archfiend Seraph" to detach a Chaos Overlay Unit ("Archfiend Seraph": 3 → 2 ORU), reduce the ATK of "Manipulator of Souls" to 0 ("Manipulator of Souls": 1500 → 0 ATK), and  negate  its effects. "Archfiend Seraph" attacks "Manipulator of Souls", but Vector activates his face-down  Continuous Trap Card  " Evil 1 " to prevent the destruction of "Manipulator of Souls" by battle and make the Battle Damage become equal to his current Life Points minus 1 (Vector: 4000 → 1 LP, Dumon: 4000 → 1 LP). On Dumon's End Phase, the effect of "Celestial Rage" expires ("Archfiend Seraph": 4900 → 2900 ATK) and the first effect of "Don Thousand's Throne" activates (Vector: 1 → 4000 LP).
 
         " Damage Pot " explodes.     
 Turn 7: Vector 
Vector draws. He then activates the final effect of "Evil 1" to  send  it to the Graveyard and destroy any card on the  field  at the expense of skipping this turn's  Battle Phase . He chooses "Damage Pot", whose final effect will inflict damage to all players equal to the damage that it reduced at activation once it  leaves the field . As a  Trap Card  that would inflict damage was activated, Dumon activates his face-down " Sacred Shield " to make the damage 0 and increase the ATK of "Ragnafinity" (a  Fairy - Type  monster) equal to the total damage that would have been inflicted to all players ("Ragnafinity": 2800 → 6700 ATK). On Vector's End Phase, the final effect of "Sacred Shield" makes Dumon take 3900 damage (an amount equal to the total amount of damage that the players would have taken at activation) (Dumon: 1 → 0 LP).
 Turn 8: Marin 
Marin draws. "Ragnafinity" attacks "Manipulator of Souls".
 Duel continues in  the next episode . 
 
 Alito vs. Girag 
         Alito  vs.  Girag .     
 Turn 1: Alito 
 Alito  draws. He then  Normal Summons  " Battlin' Boxer Big Bandage " ( 2/1100/1400) and  Sets  two cards.
 
         " Number C106: Giant Red Hand "  equipped  with " Number 58: Burner Visor ".     
 Turn 2: Girag 
Girag draws. The start of the  turn  is skipped, but  Girag   Special Summons  " Chaos Number 106: Giant Red Hand " ( 5/2600/2000, ORU: 1) in  Attack Position . Girag Normal Summons " Fire Hand " ( 4/1600/1000) in Attack Position. As he  controls  a  Pyro - Type   monster , Girag  Special Summons  " Prominence Hand " ( 4/600/2000) in  Attack Position  via its own  effect . Girag  overlays  "Fire Hand" and Prominence Hand" in order to  Xyz Summon  " Number 58: Burner Visor " ( 4/1000/1000, ORU: 2) in Attack Position. 
 Girag activates the second effect of "Burner Visor" to  detach  both its  Overlay Units  ("Burner Visor": 2 → 0 ORU) and  equip  itself to "Giant Red Hand". "Giant Red Hand" then attacks directly via the third effect of "Burner Visor" (Alito: 4000 → 1400 LP). Girag then activates the final effect of "Burner Visor" to discard " Ice Hand " and inflict 500 damage to Alito (Alito: 1400 → 900 LP). Girag then activates the final effect of "Burner Visor" again by discarding " Reload " (Alito: 900 → 400 LP). He then activates the final effect of "Burner Visor" again by discarding " The Judgement Hand ", but Alito activates his  face-down  " Hyper Burning " (as his  Life Points  would be reduced to 0) to  pay  half his Life Points (Alito: 400 → 200 LP) and reduce the damage to 0. 
 Turn 3: Alito 
Alito draws.
 Duel continues in  the next episode .

 Notes 
 There was a preview on  NAS , but it was later removed as were the previews from episodes  130  and  131 . The "old" preview for this episode was:
 
 
 
 "Galactic Outcry! Galaxy-Eyes Prime Photon Dragon, Explosive Birth!" (銀河の咆哮！銀河眼の光子竜皇、爆誕！！)
 
 
 
 Faced with an uphill battle against the onslaught of  Mizar  and his " Neo Galaxy-Eyes Tachyon Dragon ",  Kite  finds himself at his wit's end, forced to do everything to protect himself. But due to Mizar's attack, Kite finds himself with no cards on the  field  or in his  hand . At that moment, as if responding to Kite's determination to put everything into this one last  draw , his  Deck  begins to glow...!!
