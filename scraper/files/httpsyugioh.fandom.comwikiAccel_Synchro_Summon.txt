 Accel Synchro Summon
 
 
 An  Accel Synchro Summon  is a method of Summoning an  Accel Synchro Monster . This variant of  Synchro Summon  is used in the  Yu-Gi-Oh! 5D's  anime and was first seen in  Episode 74 , performed by  Bruno  while in his identity as  Vizor .
 When performing an Accel Synchro Summon, the required  Synchro Material Monsters  must be themselves  Synchro Monsters . As usual, 1  Tuner Monster  and 1 or more non-Tuner monsters are required; this effectively makes the requirement 1  Tuner Synchro Monster  and 1 or more non-Tuner Synchro Monsters. In order for it to count as an Accel Synchro Summon, the summoned Synchro Monster itself must require a Synchro Tuner and a Synchro Non-Tuner. This is due to the fact that in the anime, Accel Synchro Monsters are a different card type than ordinary Synchro Monsters, but in the TCG/OCG they are simply Synchro Monsters with Synchro Monsters listed as their Materials.
 In the 5D's anime, an Accel Synchro Summon can only be successfully performed when the user is in a state of  Clear Mind . Accel Synchro Summoning can be performed even during the opponent's  turn . In the anime, this ability is an inherent property of Accel Synchro Monsters (as they are classified as a sub-division of regular Synchro Monsters), but in the TCG/OCG this ability is due to the effect of Synchro Tuner Monsters (as Accel Synchro Monsters aren't a separate class of monster). When such a Summon is performed in the anime, the Duelist and the Synchro Materials are shown to rapidly accelerate, briefly vanish, and then reappear behind their opponent along with their new Accel Synchro Monster.
