 Biography 
 Eurea and Aporia battled  Meklords  together. They managed to shoot at a "" Meklord Emperor Granel " from a building, inflicting some damage. However, the "Granel" attacked the building they were shooting from,  killing her . [2] 
 Aporia survived the attack and regarded her death as his despair of losing someone he loved. His embodiment  Primo  is based on the despair he suffered at this part of his life. [3] 
 In the dub, Aporia referred to her as his "lieutenant".
