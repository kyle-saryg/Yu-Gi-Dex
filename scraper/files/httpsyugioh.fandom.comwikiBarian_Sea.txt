 History 
 In the Past 
 This sea held  Don Thousand  prisoner as he had fought against  Astral  himself thousands of years ago and lost, who then sealed him in this location. Also within this sea is where  Mr. Heartland  ended up when he fell into the portal before  Dr. Faker  Dueled against Yuma, Shark and Kite. [1] 
 
 Mythyrian Number War 
 After the  Battle of Sargasso  ended,  Vector  swam through the sea, which burned his injured body even further, to the place where  Don Thousand  was sealed and released him. He offered Don Thousand his life in exchange for the power to defeat Yuma and Astral. Thousand told him to journey to the  Human World  and procure the seven sealed " Mythyrian Numbers ", which would fully revive Don Thousand. Vector agreed and Thousand merged with him, empowering Vector with new abilities and restoring his severely wounded body. [1]
