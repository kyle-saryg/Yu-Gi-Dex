 Joey Wheeler  and  Mako Tsunami  faced each other in a game of  Duel Monsters , during the  Battle City  arc, in the  Yu-Gi-Oh!  anime . It is based on   Katsuya Jonouchi and Ryota Kajiki's Duelin  the  Yu-Gi-Oh! (manga) .
 
 Prior Events 
 Mako Tsunami is having fun with the fish, dolphins and whale in the until he gets busted by the Aquarium's owner, who suddenly comes down with a fever. As a man of the sea, Mako offers to perform in her show.
 Joey and his friends arrive at the aquarium where to their surprise Mako is performing. Joey and the others greet him. Mako tells Joey that he already has four locator cards, so Joey sees this as an opportunity. Both he and Mako wager two Locator cards, and the winner goes to the finals. After finalizing the agreement, the duel proceeds.
 
 Featured Duel: Joey Wheeler vs. Mako Tsunami 
 Turn 1: Joey 
 Joey  draws " Parasite Paracide ", forgetting he had it in his Deck still. Thinking he can use it to infect Mako's monsters, he  Sets  it.
 Turn 2: Mako 
 Mako  draws " Flying Fish " and subsequently Normal Summons it (800/500) in  Attack Position . "Flying Fish"  attacks  and destroys  Joey's   Set   monster , "Parasite Paracide" (500/300). Since Joey has no monsters to Tribute, the  Flip Effect  of "Parasite Paracide" doesn't  activate . (In the real game, " Parasite Paracide " would have been shuffled into Mako's Deck and further effects would be activated if he were to draw it. This exchange was presumably done for comedic effect.)
 Turn 3: Joey 
 Joey  draws. He then  Sets  a  monster .
 Turn 4: Mako 
 Mako  draws. He then  Sets  a card.
 Turn 5: Joey 
 Joey  draws "Garoozis". He then  Tributes  his  Set   monster  in order to  Tribute Summon  " Garoozis " (1800/1500) in  Attack Position , but  Mako   activates  his face-down " Torrential Tribute " to  destroy  "Garoozis".
 Turn 6: Mako 
Mako draws. "Flying Fish"  attacks  directly (Joey 4000 → 3200). Mako then sets one card.
 Turn 7: Joey 
 Joey  draws. He then  Normal Summons  " Alligator's Sword " (1500/1200) in Attack Position. He then  Sets  two cards.
 Turn 8: Mako 
 Mako  draws "Amphibian Beast". He then  Tributes  "Flying Fish" in order to  Tribute Summon  " Amphibian Beast " (2400/2000) in  Attack Position . "Amphibian Beast"  attacks  "Alligator's Sword", but  Joey   activates  his face-down " Fairy Box " which places "Alligator's Sword" in a whack-a-monster box, therefore "Amphibian Beast" can't attack right away.  Mako  counters by  activating  his set " Umi ", which increases the ATK and DEF of all Fish, Sea Serpent, Thunder, and Aqua-Type monsters by 200 ("Amphibian Beast": 2400 → 2600/ 2000 → 2200). 
 The activation of "Umi" also raises the water level above the top of "Fairy Box", suffocating "Alligator's Sword" and preventing him from hiding inside the box. "Amphibian Beast" continues with its attack, but  Joey   activates  his face-down " Skull Dice " to roll a die and divide the ATK of "Amphibian Beast" by the result. Joey gets a four ("Amphibian Beast": 2600 → 650/2200). "Alligator's Sword"  destroys  "Amphibian Beast" (Mako 4000 → 3300).
 Joey  has 3200  Life Points  remaining and controls " Alligator's Sword " (1500/1200) in Attack Position.
 Mako  has 3300 Life Points remaining and controls " Umi ".
 Turn 9: Joey 
 Joey  draws " Polymerization ". He then  Normal Summons  " Baby Dragon " (1200/700) in  Attack Position . Next he  activates  "Polymerization", fusing "Baby Dragon" and " Alligator's Sword " in order to  Fusion Summon  " Alligator's Sword Dragon " (1700/1600) in  Attack Position . Due to the rules of Battle City, Fusion Monsters are forbidden from attacking the turn they are Fusion Summoned.
 Turn 10: Mako 
 Mako  draws. He then  Sets  a  monster .
 Turn 11: Joey 
Joey draws. Since the only monster Mako controls is a set monster, "Alligator's Sword Dragon"  attacks   directly  via its own effect ( Mako Tsunami  3300 → 1600). 
 Turn 12: Mako 
 Mako  draws. He then  Sets  a card.
 Turn 13: Joey 
Joey draws. He then sets a card. "Alligator's Sword Dragon" attacks directly, but Mako  activates  his face-down " Tornado Wall ". Now while " Umi " is face-up, Mako will take no Battle Damage from any of Joey's attacking monsters. The attack continues, but Mako takes no damage.
 Turn 14: Mako 
 Mako   Tributes  his  Set   monster  in order to  Tribute Summon  " The Legendary Fisherman " (1850/1600) in  Attack Position . "The Legendary Fisherman" attacks "Alligator's Sword Dragon", but  Joey   activates  his face-down " Energy Drain " to  draw  a card and reduce the ATK of "The Legendary Fisherman" to 0. However, "The Legendary Fisherman" is unaffected by the  effects  of  Magic Cards  while " Umi " is on the  field , so "Energy Drain" doesn't work on it. "The Legendary Fisherman" then  destroys  "Alligator's Sword Dragon". ( Joey  3200 → 3050).
 Turn 15: Joey 
 Joey Wheeler  draws. He then  Sets  a  monster .
 Turn 16: Mako 
Mako draws. "The Legendary Fisherman"  attacks  and  destroys   Joey's   Set   monster . It's revealed to be " Tiny Guardian " (1400/1800).
 Turn 17: Joey 
 Joey Wheeler  draws. He then  Sets  a card and  Sets  a  monster .
 Turn 18: Mako 
Mako  activates  " Fortress Whale's Oath " to Tribute " Jellyfish " and " Great White " from his hand and  Ritual Summon  " Fortress Whale " (2350 → 2550/2150 → 2350) in Attack Position. "The Legendary Fisherman"  attacks  and  destroys   Joey 's  Set   monster . It's revealed to be " Rocket Warrior " (1500/1300). "Fortress Whale" attacks directly ( Joey  3050 → 500).
 Turn 19: Joey 
 Joey  draws "Lightning Blade". His hand contains " Scapegoat ", " Kunai with Chain ", " Panther Warrior ", and "Lightning Blade". Joey  Sets  two cards and  Normal Summons  "Panther Warrior" (2000/1600) in  Attack Position .
 Turn 20: Mako 
Mako draws. "Fortress Whale"  attacks  "Panther Warrior", but  Joey   activates  his face-down " Magic Arm Shield " to redirect the attack to "The Legendary Fisherman". "Fortress Whale"  destroys  "The Legendary Fisherman" ( Mako  1600 → 900).
 Turn 21: Joey 
Joey passes.
 Turn 22: Mako 
Mako draws. "Fortress Whale" attacks "Panther Warrior", but Joey  activates  his face-down "Kunai with Chain" to equip the latter to "Panther Warrior" and increase the ATK of "Panther Warrior" by 500 ("Panther Warrior": 2000 → 2500/1600). Joey then activates his face-down " Lightning Blade " to equip the latter to "Panther Warrior" and increase the ATK of "Panther Warrior" by 800 ("Panther Warrior": 2500 → 3300/1600). "Panther Warrior"  destroys  "Fortress Whale" (Mako 900 → 150). Mako then activates " Return of the Doomed " to discard one card and  Special Summon  "The Legendary Fisherman" (1850/1600) from his Graveyard in  Attack Position .
 Turn 23: Joey 
 Joey  draws " Giant Trunade " and subsequently activates it to return all  Magic / Trap Cards  from the  field  to their respective owners'  hands  ("Panther Warrior": 3300 → 2000/1600). 
 Joey exposes Mako's "Legendary Fisherman", and the latter accepts defeat and tells him to finish him off.
 Joey then activates "Scapegoat" to  Special Summon  four " Sheep Tokens " (0/0 for all four) in  Defense Position . Joey then  Tributes  one "Sheep Token" to allow "Panther Warrior" to attack. "Panther Warrior" attacks and destroys "The Legendary Fisherman" ( Mako  150 → 0).
 Joey Wins
