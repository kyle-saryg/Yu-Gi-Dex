 Lyrics 
 Life's just a game we all wanna win.  
Keep your hand a secret, unleash the monsters within!  
Sometimes it's over before it's even begun.  
If someone else gets hurt then, what have you really won?
 I'm always one card short, always one day late!  
For once I'd like an ending I can celebrate.  
Stacked the deck myself, so there's no one else to blame.  
I need just one more move, one final chance to prove  
I can win this game.
 Life's just a duel, that's how the world is made.  
But are we really players, or are we being played?
 I'm always one card short, always one day late!  
For once I'd like an ending I can celebrate.  
Stacked the deck myself, so there's no one else to blame.  
I need just one more move, one final chance to prove  
I can win this game.
 Is what happens next in your control?  
Are you doing what you want, or what you've been told?  
Do you choose the cards from your own hand,  
Or are we just puppets in a master plan?
 One more move!
 I'm always one card short, always one day late!  
For once I'd like an ending I can celebrate.  
Stacked the deck myself, so there's no one else to blame.  
I need just one more move, one final chance to prove  
I can win this game.
 One card short, one day late!  
Give me somethin', somethin' to celebrate!  
Stacked the deck myself so there's no one else to blame.
 One more move I'm gonna win this game,  
I'm gonna win this game.  
I'm gonna win this game!
 One more move, I'll win this game.  
Then I'm gonna celebrate!  
Then I'm gonna celebrate!
