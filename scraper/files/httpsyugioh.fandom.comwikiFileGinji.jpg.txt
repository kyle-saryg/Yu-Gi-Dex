 Weasel , known as  Ginji  in the Japanese version, is a character in  Yu-Gi-Oh! ZEXAL . He is a member of  Scorch  and  Chills 's gang.
 
 Biography 
 Weasel was present at the  arcade  that the gang makes their headquarters in when  Yuma Tsukumo ,  Tori Meadows  and  Bronk Stone  went there to find  Shark . When Shark revealed that he knows them, he and the rest of the gang backed off. [1]  He was perturbed that Shark never  Duels  with any of them and went to  Scorch  and  Chills , hoping they'd do something about Shark's arrogance. They told him that Shark isn't really one of them - they wanted to use him to make money on the underground circuit. They informed Weasel of their plan to rob the museum of a "super rare Deck" containing " Chaos End Ruler - Ruler of the Beginning and the End ". Weasel is hesitant to help, and Scorch questioned why - Weasel always wanted to do something big. Weasel talked with Shark later, as the brothers intended to lay the blame on the two of them for the theft. Shark told him to leave town while he still could. Weasel instead ran and informed Yuma of the situation, who agreed to help Shark. [2] 
 
 Trivia 
 The letters and colors on Weasel's shirt stand for  Rikuo  and  Kaio  and their Number attributes.
