 Anime appearances 
 Legendary Heroes 
 The Big Five  set the Mythic Dragon as the final boss in the  Legendary Heroes  virtual reality game, before trapping  Seto Kaiba  inside it.
 Inside the game, the vilagers were forced to make a sacrifice every year to ressurect the Mythic Dragon. This time round they were going to sacrifice Kaiba and  Princess Edina .  Yugi  and his friends saved Kaiba and prevented the sacrifices, but the Big Five modified the games coding and revived it anyway.
 Kaiba,  Yugi  and their friends faced the Mythic Dragon in a chamber, where only  Dragon - Type  monsters could attack. The Dragon began taking out their friends and the Dragons they Summoned. With just Yugi and Kaiba left, they summoned " Dragon Master Knight " and used it to defeat the Mythic Dragon.
 
 Yu-Gi-Oh! Capsule Monsters 
 In the  Yu-Gi-Oh! Capsule Monsters  arc, the  Five-Headed Dragon  was the result of 5 Dragons called "The Fiendish Five" fusing together after being struck down by  Yami Yugi  with the Sword of Divinity.  The monsters that formed the  Five-Headed Dragon  at the time were  Meteor Dragon ,  Luster Dragon #2 ,  Tyrant Dragon ,  Aqua Dragon , and  Serpent Night Dragon .  Like in the original Duel Monsters game, the  Five-Headed Dragon  could not be defeated except by  LIGHT  monsters.   Tristan  and  Téa  attacked with all the  LIGHT  monsters they had collected, but even together, they were ineffective.  The  Five-Headed Dragon  was eventually defeated when  Yami Yugi  upgraded his Duel Armor and used the power of the  Blue-Eyes White Dragon  to lay the monster to rest again.
 
 Yu-Gi-Oh! GX 
 In  Yu-Gi-Oh! GX , F.G.D appeared in the episode 160, "Fusing Souls! Neos VS F.G.D".
 Honest describes  Duel Monsters  cards as the gates that connect each dimension to this one and that they connect the souls of the  duelist  to the souls of the Duel Monster. The more a duelist cares for their cards, the stronger that bond becomes. However, cards that are not cared for become tainted in darkness and that is causing certain cards not to respond to Duel Disks. 
 If these cards are left the way they are, the World of Darkness will seep into the human dimension via the cards.  Trueman  and his clones are still watching and determine that Honest won't eliminate Jaden and that they must combine their power to defeat him. The 5 merge together.
 The  duel  begins, with Trueman  activating  " Future Fusion " to  Summon  " Five-Headed Dragon " two  turns  later.  Jaden  comments he'll just end the duel before that time comes, but Trueman activates " Dragon's Mirror ", immediately  Summoning  another " Five-Headed Dragon ", with the first still set to appear two  turns  later.
 Trueman also activates " Skill Drain ",  negating  the  effects  of all  Effect Monsters . Jaden barely each  turn   negates   attacks  and  Summoning  a wall of  Defense Position  monsters. 
 Trueman  Sets  " Dragon's Rage ", which would give " Five-Headed Dragon " the  Piercing  effect. 
 He also has " The Dragon's Bead "  Set , which would negate effects that  target  " Five-Headed Dragon ". Trueman believes his victory is assured. However, Jaden wins using " Honest " to power up " Elemental Hero Neos " and win the duel.
