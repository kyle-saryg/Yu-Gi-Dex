 Extra Deck 
 The article still says "Fusion Deck", but its name has been changed into "Extra Deck" now.
 
 Should we... 
 Should we add info on Accel Synchro Summon once it's shown thoroughly in the anime?  UltraSynchron  06:02, September 3, 2009 (UTC)
 
 Sure  Qim1  20:55, September 8, 2009 (UTC) 
 New Format 
 The new archetype  Dragonstar  mentions Synchro Summoning in some of its monsters' Japanese lores, and it is written as  Ｓ 召喚, simillar to how Pendulum Summoning is  Ｐ 召喚. So, shouldn't we rename the summoning and the monster type? -- FruityMan99  ( talk  •  contribs ) 20:02, April 13, 2014 (UTC)
 
 I'm not seeing how that necessitates any renames. All it would require would be updating the Japanese names shown on the articles.  「 ディノ 奴 千？！ 」 ?  ·  ☎ Dinoguy1000  20:39, April 13, 2014 (UTC)
