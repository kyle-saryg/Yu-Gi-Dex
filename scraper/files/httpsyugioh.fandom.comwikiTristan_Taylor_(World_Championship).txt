 Decks 
 In  Yu-Gi-Oh! Duel Monsters , Honda's Deck consists of multiple copies of " Dark Plant ", " Kuriboh " and " Skull Servant ".
 In  Yu-Gi-Oh! Duel Monsters III: Tri-Holy God Advent  and  Yu-Gi-Oh! Dark Duel Stories , Tristan's Deck consists of various low- Level  monsters.
 In  Yu-Gi-Oh! World Championship 2004 , Tristan's Deck contains mostly low  ATK  and  DEF   Normal Monsters . His high ATK monsters include " Stone D. ", " Hyozanryu ", " Mikazukinoyaiba " and " Goblin Attack Force " and he has a number of  Equip Spell Cards , which can increase ATK.
 Tristan's  WCT2005  deck is a big improvement over his '04 one.  His strategy
revolves around using equip spells and fusing monsters to form strong ones like
Skull Knight and Meteor B. Dragon.  He's one of the most challenging tier 1
opponents in the game, surprisingly enough, as he uses equip spells that can be
put back at the top of his deck if they're sent from the field to the
graveyard.
