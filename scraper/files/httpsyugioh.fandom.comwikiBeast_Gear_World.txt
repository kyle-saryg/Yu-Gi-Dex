 Beast Gear World , known as  Beast Machine World  ( 獣 機 界   Jūkikai ) in Japanese, is a  series  of  Beast-Warrior   monsters  used by  Yoshio Atachi  in the  Yu-Gi-Oh! SEVENS  anime.
 
 Etymology 
 Design-wise, its members are based on anthropomorphic animals in biker gear. It is based on the  Hokuto no Ken  (known as  Fist of the North Star  in English) franchise, with several cards alluding to its "Century's End" post-apocaliptic setting as well as its characters.
