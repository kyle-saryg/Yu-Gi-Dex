 Biography 
 Ancient Egypt 
 Dark Magician was created when  Mahad  fused his ba with " Illusion Magician ", his  ka  while fighting  Thief King Bakura . 
 The Dark Magician fended off the ghosts and battled Diabound. He then continued to serve the  Pharaoh  in the form of the Dark Magician.
 
 3D Bonds Beyond Time 
       Dark Magician attacks alongside " Elemental HERO Neos " and " Stardust Dragon ".     
 When " Dark Magician Girl " was Summoned by the effect of " Bond Between Teacher and Student ",  she  became worried when she saw  Paradox 's monsters. Dark Magician encouraged her that victory can be assured if they joined forces with their master (in the dub, he stated that as magicians, there was no trick they couldn't pull off).
 
 Other appearances 
 In  The Falsebound Kingdom , when the player goes back to Yugi's story the second time, Dark Magician will appear when the player defeats mission eight. He was waiting for Yugi, he tells Yugi about the past and then he joins the party. When  Dark Magician Girl  arrives late, Dark Magician was furious and told his student not to make any excuses. When Yugi ask who she was, Dark Magician says that she was a student called back from her training. He will ask Yugi to put her in the bottom of the roster.
