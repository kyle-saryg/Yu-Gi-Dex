 Margaret Mai Beaufort  is the  Yu-Gi-Oh! The Duelists of the Roses  incarnation of  Mai Valentine  and portrayal of  Lady Margaret Beaufort . She is a member of the Red Roses of Lancaster.
 With the White Roses of York well ahead in their struggle for power with the Red Roses, Margaret secretly requested a high druid,  Simon McMooran , to summon a duelist from another age. The player takes on the role of the duelist summoned.
 If the player chooses to side with the White Roses, they face Margaret at  Canterbury  after defeating  T. Tristan Grey . After defeating her, the player goes to Dover where they take a boat to France.
 The player can obtain " Dust Tornado " by using the  find  ability on E7 while playing against Margaret.
