A  Pseudo-Trap Monster  is a  Trap Card  that, like  Trap Monsters , is treated as a  monster  by its own  effect . Unlike Trap Monsters, however, Pseudo-Trap Monsters are  not  also treated as Trap Cards, meaning they cannot be destroyed by cards that destroy traps such as " Mystical Space Typhoon ", and they cannot be negated by cards that negate Trap Cards or effects such as " Jinzo " or " Royal Decree ".
 While all true Trap Monsters Special Summon themselves from the  Spell & Trap Zones  after activation as their main effect, most Pseudo-Trap Monsters instead behave as normal Traps when activated, having the same variety of effects as other  Spells  or Traps, but they also have a second effect that allows them to be Special Summoned from another location (usually the Graveyard) at certain timings.
 Also differing from proper Trap Monsters, when a Pseudo-Trap Monster is  flipped   face-down  while treated as a monster, it is  set  in the  Monster Zone  instead of a Spell & Trap Zone. If flipped  face-up  again after that, it will still be a monster. However, in this case, conditions that specify "If Summoned this way" will not be applied anymore.
 The " Paleozoic "  archetype  is primarily composed of Pseudo-Trap Monsters. The " The Phantom Knights " archetype also includes a remarkable number of them.
