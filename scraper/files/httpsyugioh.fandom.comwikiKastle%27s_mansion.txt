 History 
 One night, Rio stole Reginald's  Deck , causing Reginald to chase after her to reclaim it. During this, they accidentally knocked a suit of armor which almost fell on Rio. However, Reginald managed to push her out of the way, acquiring a scar on his right shoulder from where the armor cut him. [1] 
 Reginald later revisited the house and remembered the night when he was scarred. After this, he was attacked by  Chironex . Reginald broke through a window to escape, but Chironex caught him in his tendrils and infected him with poison. The two were soon joined by  Quattro  outside the mansion. They then began a  Tag Duel  against Chironex. [1]
