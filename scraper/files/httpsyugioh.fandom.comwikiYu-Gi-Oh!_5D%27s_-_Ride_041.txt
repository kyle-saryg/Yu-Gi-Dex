 Summary 
 As " Queen Angel of Roses " faces off against " Beelze, King of Dark Dragons ,"  Sect  tells  Akiza  to bring it. Thinking that if she wins this ritual, the  Ultimate God  won't awaken. The score stands at Akiza on 4000  Life Points  and Sect on 3400, as Akiza activates the  Quick-Play Spell Card  " Past Life ," exchanging a monster on her field for one from her  Extra Deck  with the same  Level  and  ATK . The  Skeleton Knight  looks quite surprised as  Rex Goodwin  chuckles. Releasing "Queen Angel," Akiza chants "Lofty rose that buds in a garden of integrity! Bloom here, watered by blue moonlight!" as she Summons " Moonlight Dragon Black Rose ." Sect observes that that's Akiza's  Duel Dragon , but it won't help, not with the same ATK as "Queen Angel's." Akiza activates "Black Rose's" effect in response; when a monster has been  Special Summoned , she can return one monster from the field to the player's hand. Sect gasps in shock, and Akiza observes that he's figured it out:  Synchro Monster  cards can't exist in the  Main Deck  in the first place, therefore they return to the Extra Deck. She orders "Black Rose" to play its " Rose Ballad ," and a whirlwind surrounds "Beelze," returning it to the Extra Deck. Sect is furious, but Akiza is already attacking, twisting around the edge of the pillar of light and ordering "Black Rose's" attack. Sect opens a Set card, " Hell Vermin Mine ." He sends a " Hell " monster, his " Hell Spider " from his hand to the  Graveyard , and destroys "Black Rose." He yells at it to explode into a million pieces.
 Claiming that she can already see that future as well, Akiza activates another monster effect from her hand, discarding " Rose Archer " to negate and destroy her opponent's  Trap Card . Calling her future victory unshaken, Akiza has "Black Rose" attack directly with "Rose Requiem," reducing Sect to 1000 Life Points and causing him to fall behind. Akiza Sets a card to end her turn.
 Sect declares his turn, but he has no cards in his hand and none on his field, and decides to bet everything on this draw. He draws a  Spell Card , " Hell Gift ," and immediately activates it since it's the only card in his hand. He draws three cards, and Akiza notes that it's a convenient card that he's drawn. Sect snickers, admitting that "Hell Gift" is a high-risk, high return card. If he doesn't Summon a "Hell" monster this turn, he'll take 3000 damage, and it'll all be over. Akiza laughs softly, reassuring Sect that he shouldn't worry: he won't lose on this turn and telling him to face his cards without fear. Sect does so, asking if this is just because she can see the future, and claiming that there's just no way. But he does have one, an extra-big one too, and he promptly  Normal Summons  it - " Hell Centipede ." It has 2600 ATK and is  Level 7 , but since Akiza controls a monster and he doesn't, Sect can Summon the monster without Release. And since it was a Normal Summon, "Black Rose's" effect can't touch him. Sect attacks, but Akiza points out that she told him that she could see it. That isn't enough to change "Black Rose's" destiny, or hers. She activates her Trap Card, " Black Rose Seed ," increasing the ATK and  DEF  of her monster by 800 during the  Battle Phase . "Black Rose" rises to 3200 ATK and blasts "Hell Centipede" in two with "Rose Requiem," reducing Sect to 400 Life Points. The Battle Phase ends, and "Black Rose's" ATK returns to normal. Sect slams his fist down, cursing Akiza, and Setting a card face-down to end his turn.
 Goodwin muses that this isn't good. If the Ultimate God is to be resurrected, the  Duel Priestess  must lose, and if this continues... Akiza declares her turn, thinking that her winner's five has led her this far, and that she doesn't even need cards anymore. She attacks with "Black Rose," and Sect activates a Set card, " Hell Summon ." It Special Summons a "Hell" monster from his Graveyard, and he calls back "Hell Spider" in  Defense Position . Akiza calls him a sore loser, and she activates "Black Rose's" effect to return "Hell Spider" to Sect's hand since he Special Summoned a monster. She tells "Black Rose" to sing, and "Black Rose" returns "Hell Spider" to the hand with "Rose Ballad."
 Akiza declares that this is the future that she saw. 5000 years ago, though she may not have known what she was doing, she trusted Rex and committed a sin. All that she had left were regrets. This victory won't erase that sin, but for that very reason, she'll stop the resurrection of the Ultimate God in this age. She tells Rex and Roman that she knows they wish for her defeat, but they won't get it. "Black Rose" attacks with "Rose Requiem..." but then it is trapped in spiderwebs. Sect snickers, asking her how that future of hers went. He reveals that the effect of "Hell Spider" activated when it left the field, ending the turn's Battle Phase. He mockingly asks her if that wasn't her final turn, telling Akiza to hurry up and finish him already, using that future victory thing she saw. Akiza has no choice but to end her turn, and Sect mocks her again. He declares his own turn, and a "Forsee Draw," though he's just mocking her again. He Summons the  Tuner monster  " Hell Grub ," and sends a "Hell" monster, ""Hell Spider," from his hand to the Graveyard to Special Summon a Synchro Monster that has been Synchro Summoned previously with its effect negated. Akiza notes the effect in surprise, as Sect tells his monster to rise again. "Beelze, King of Dark Dragons" appears again, and Akiza thinks that this is a trial. But still, even if the future of her winner's five has changed, she'll be the one to overcome this trial and win. She still has a solid advantage. Sneering, Sect tells her that he'll show her the future from hell as Goodwin grins nastily.
 
 Featured Duel: Sect Ijuin vs. Akiza Izinski 
 Duel continues from  the previous Ride . 
 Turn 2: Akiza 
Akiza  activates  " Past Life ",  Tributing  " Queen Angel of Roses " to  Special Summon  " Moonlight Dragon Black Rose " (2400/1800) in  Attack Position . As it was Special Summoned, its  effect  activates,  returning  Sect's " Beelze, King of Dark Dragons " back to his  Extra Deck . "Black Rose"  attacks  Sect  directly , with Sect activating his  face-down  " Hell Vermin Mine ",  sending  1 " Hell "  monster  from his  hand  to the  Graveyard  in an attempt to  destroy  "Black Rose", but Akiza  chains  with the " Rose Archer " in her hand, sending it to the Graveyard in order to  negate  and destroy Sect's  Trap Card . The attack resumes (Sect 3400 → 1000). Akiza  Sets  a card.
 Turn 3: Sect 
Sect activates " Hell Gift ", allowing him to, as that's the only card in his hand,  draw  3 cards, with the risk of taking 3000  damage  if he doesn't Summon a "Hell" monster this  turn . He  Normal Summons  " Hell Centipede " (2600/1300) in Attack Position, with no Tributes via its own effect. Sect attacks "Black Rose" with "Hell Centipede", but Akiza activates her face-down " Black Rose Seed ", increasing the  ATK  and  DEF  of her "Black Rose" by 800 during the  Battle Phase  (2400/1800 → 3200/2600). "Hell Centipede" is destroyed (Sect 1000 → 400). Sect Sets a card.
 Turn 4: Akiza 
Akiza attacks Sect directly with "Black Rose", but Sect activates his face-down " Hell Summon ", Special Summoning " Hell Spider " (100/2000), which he had previously sent to the Graveyard, from his Graveyard. The effect of "Black Rose" activates, sending "Hell Spider" back to Sect's hand. At that moment, the effect of "Hell Spider" activates, which, when it has  left  the  field , immediately ends the  Battle Phase .
 Turn 5: Sect 
Sect Normal Summons " Hell Grub " (0/0) and activates its effect, sending a "Hell" monster from his hand to the Graveyard in order to Special Summon "Beelze, King of Dark Dragons" (3000/3000) back, with its effects negated.
 Duel continues in  the next Ride .
