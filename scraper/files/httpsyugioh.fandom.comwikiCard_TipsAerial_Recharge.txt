 This card can be  searched  by " A Cat of Ill Omen " and " The Despair Uranus ". 
 Because of this card's maintenance cost, it is best activated like a Normal Trap Card, though with the drawback shared with most Continuous Trap Cards which requires that it be face-up on the field to activate and resolve its effect. 
 Follow up this card with another  Spell Speed 2  effect that Tributes for cost (such as " Spiritual Wind Art - Miyabi ", " Ballista Squad " or even " Chaos Burst "). 
 This card easily triggers the effect of " Mecha Phantom Beast Megaraptor " to summon another token, thus enabling effects that require Tributing 2 monsters, such as " Double Magical Arm Bind " or " Orcustrated Release ".
