      Depiction of Decking out in the anime     
 A  Deck out  (Japanese: デッキアウト  Dekki Auto ) is a loss due to having no cards in the  Main Deck  when that player would  draw a card .  Mill Decks , such as " Laval ", use this as their primary  victory condition .
 A Deck out can only occur when a card would necessitate drawing specifically; being unable to  reveal  (including  excavate ),  look ,  add ,  send ,  banish , etc. cards from the Deck will not result in a loss.
 
 In the anime 
 In the anime, a Deck out has occurred only three times:  Seto Kaiba  decked out against  Maximillion Pegasus  (though in this case was more because Seto ran out of playable monster cards instead of being unable to draw a card),  Strings  against  Yami Yugi , and  Howard X Miller  against  Jaden Yuki . Though Kaiba's deck may have either been sent to the graveyard or banished by Crush Card Virus's effect, therefore technically being unable to draw. 
 Duelists such as  Seto Kaiba ,  Ishizu Ishtar ,  Anubis ,  Zigfried von Schroeder  (through  Leon von Schroeder ),  Yami Bakura , Howard X Miller,  Sartorius ,  Mr. Armstrong ,  Shadow Drone   Trudge ,  Breo ,  Jean ,  Vector  and  Eliphas  have attempted to cause their opponents to deck out, albeit unsuccessfully (though in Ishizu and Jean's cases, they abandoned their strategies to focus on different ones).
