 "Syrus's Real Strength!!" , known as  "Sho's Real Strength!!"  in the Japanese version is the forty-ninth chapter of the  Yu-Gi-Oh! GX  manga . It was first printed in Japanese in the  V Jump  magazine and in English in the  Shonen Jump  magazine. Both of which were printed in  volume 7  of the  Yu-Gi-Oh! GX  graphic novels afterwards.
 Syrus Truesdale  and  Chazz Princeton   Tag Duel  against  James Crocodile Cook  and  Axel Brodie .
 
 Summary 
 Jim  grins, thinking that  Chazz  shouldn't let that go to his head - this Duel is just getting started. He looks at the " Dark Alligator " in his hand, and decides to make the Duel even more interesting. The score stands with Chazz and  Syrus  at 2800, and Jim and  Axel  at 2700. Jim begins to make the match a  Shadow Game , but much to his shock,  Principal MacKenzie  prevents him from releasing the darkness, though both  Jaden  and Chazz notice something wrong. Deciding that he's supposed to play it straight and behave himself, Jim mutters that the fun will have to wait, Summoning " Reptia Egg " in  Defense Position , Setting two cards, and switching Axel's " Electro Gunner " into Defense Position. He scornfully thinks that this is boring.  Tragoedia  watches with  Chancellor Sheppard , chuckling inwardly and thinking that Jim shouldn't be so impatient, all their pieces aren't in place yet, and he wants to savor this.
 Syrus draws, noting the two monsters on Jim and Axel's field, thinking that Jim's face down cards must be support cards to protect the "Egg". He Summons " Heliroid ", and then activates " March of the Roids ", allowing him to  Special Summon  a  Level 4  or lower " roid " when he controls another, Special Summoning " Missile Roid ". Then he uses "Heliroid's" effect, allowing "Missile Roid" to attack directly. Jaden cheers upon seeing a "roid" combo, and "Heliroid" fires "Missile Roid" at Jim and Axel, reducing them to 1700  Life Points . Then he attacks "Electro Gunner" with Chazz's "Burning Dragon" and destroys it, leaving the "Eggs" for "Heliroid" to attack. Jim protects them with " Snare ", negating the attack, and preventing "Heliroid" from attacking or changing battle positions for three turns. Surprised that the  Trap Card  didn't destroy "Heliroid", Syrus Sets a card and ends his turn. 
 Axel draws, and thinks that on Jim's next turn, his "Reptia Egg" will Summon three  Reptiles . He wonders if Jim will use them as Tributes to Summon a high-Level monster, before turning his attention to "Burning Dragon". Knowing that he can't defeat it, there's only one thing he can do: protect Jim's monster.  But before that, he's got to block the "roid's"  direct attack , and to do that, he'll destroy one of the monsters. He Summons " Electro Sergeant ", and uses its effect to prevent Syrus from activating his Set " Mechanic's Soul ", and then attacks and destroys "Missile Roid", reducing Chazz and Syrus to 2200 Life Points. Setting a card, Axel thinks that that's all he can get done this turn. 
 Chazz draws,  Tributing  "Heliroid" and Summoning " Steel Dragoon ". Jaden cheers his second high-Level  Dragon , and Chazz attacks the "Reptia Eggs" with "Steel Dragoon". Axel protects them with Jim's " Camouflage ", allowing the  Level 2  or lower "Eggs" to evade the attack. "Burning Dragon" then attacks, but Axel counters with his own Trap, " Electric Shock ", as he has a  Machine  on the field, the attack is negated, and "Burning Dragon's" ATK is lowered by 500 points, to 2000. Chazz angrily ends his turn, and he and Syrus bemoan their inability to destroy the "Eggs". 
 Jim congratulates Axel, and uses the effect of "Reptia Egg", Tributing it to Summon three " Alligator Babies ". Syrus and Chazz know he's going to Summon a powerful monster, but they are unprepared for Jim using  four  sacrifices to Summon his "Dark Alligator." This high cost allows Jim to Summon two 2000 ATK " Alligator Tokens ", one of which immediately attacks "Steel Dragoon". Both monsters are destroyed, and Jim follows up with "Dark Alligator's" attack, destroying "Burning Dragon" and reducing Chazz and Syrus to 1700 Life Points. Before the last Token can attack, Chazz uses " Immortal Dragon " to Special Summon "Burning Dragon". Jaden whispers that that was too close, and  Alexis  agrees.
 Syrus begins his turn, noting the two 2000 ATK monsters he's up against. He's drawn " Old Model to the Frontline ", but he doesn't have anything in his hand to beat them - until he notices one of his "roids". He tells Chazz that he's going to finish the Duel, and Chazz tells him to do it. Syrus Summons " Launcher Roid " and activates "Old Model to the Frontline", Special Summoning "Missile Roid" from his  Graveyard . He activates the effect of "Launcher Roid",  equipping  it to "Missile Roid" to increase its ATK by 500. Then he attacks the "Alligator Token", which destroys "Missile Roid" and reduces Chazz and Syrus to 1200 Life Points, but reduces the ATK of the "Alligator Token" by "Missile Roid's" ATK. Jaden tells Syrus that "he's the man", while  Bastion  comments that  that's  " Kaiser's  little brother". Jim realizes what Syrus is about to do, and Axel notes that this is the true strength of the Japanese Academy. Syrus attacks the "Alligator Token" with "Burning Dragon" and destroys it, reducing Jim and Axel's Life Points to zero. Jaden, Alexis and Bastion all cheer, and Chazz and Syrus grin at each other.
