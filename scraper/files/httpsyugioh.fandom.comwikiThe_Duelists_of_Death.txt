 The  Duelists of Death  are  The Supreme King 's most prominent underlings, consisting of  Skull Knight ,  Chaos Sorcerer ,  Skilled Dark Magician  and  Skilled White Magician  (who are able to merge into  Demise, King of Armageddon ), and  Guardian Baou .
 All of them are high-ranking and seasoned Duelists, responsible for the demise of many. During the King's reign, nearly all are defeated at the hands of  Axel ,  Zane , and  Aster , save for Guardian Baou, who is defeated by  Jaden  shortly after recovering control of his mind and body.
 They all have the ability to teleport themselves and to cast spells. They can also create  Duel Disks  attached to their arms in order to Duel.
