 The  Grand Championship , known in Japan as the  KC Grand Prix , is a tournament in the  Yu-Gi-Oh!  anime .
 Despite the defeat of  Dartz ,  Yugi  and the gang can't really celebrate since they're stranded in America; as Pegasus was the one who paid for them to fly there, the group is stuck since it would take forever to get a meeting with him to arrange a ride home. Mokuba promises them a ride home if they enter the next tournament KaibaCorp is hosting.
 The tournament is hosted at  Kaiba Land , and is being held to rebuild the company's reputation due to the damage it suffered thanks to Dartz. Being the ultimate tournament, the best Duelists from all over the world are being rounded up so they can battle for the chance to challenge Yugi for his title King of Games.
 On the other side, one of the tournament entrants is a hacker trying to send a virus into  KaibaCorp 's main computer. Kaiba's main goal is to find out who the hacker is. It turns out that the hacker is a strong Duelist named  Zigfried von Schroeder , who is actually participating in the tournament!

 Main Duelists 
 Recurring Duelists

 Mask the Rock/Apdnarg Otum:  A Duelist who turns out to be  Solomon Muto , Yugi's grandfather. His name is "Grandpa Muto" backwards. Allowed in by Mokuba as he taught Yugi all he knows about  Duel Monsters , plus maybe to even out the number of competitors. 
 Rebecca Hawkins : The American regional champion, having replaced  Bandit Keith . 
 Joey Wheeler : Ranked 2nd in  Duelist Kingdom , ranked 4th in  Battle City . 
 Weevil Underwood : Participant in Duelist Kingdom and Battle City. Secretly replaces Fortune Salim before his first duel. 
 Rex Raptor : Participant in Duelist Kingdom and Battle City. Secretly replaces Fortune Salim before his first duel. 
 New Duelists 
 Zigfried von Schroeder :  The European Duel Monsters Champion, a rival of Kaiba's, and Leon's older brother. Zigfried seeks to take down KaibaCorp as revenge because he feels that Seto Kaiba stole his plans for holographic Dueling technology. He uses the alias "Zigfried Lloyd" whenever he Duels. He comes across as arrogant and vain, but he has a kind side, as evidenced by how regretful he feels at the end of the arc for making Leon help him with his plot. He genuinely loves his brother, as Seto loves Mokuba. 
 Leon von Schroeder :  A genius who is Zigfried's brother. He uses the alias "Leon Wilson" whenever he Duels. He is a sweet child who idolizes his brother, yet realizes that what Zigfried is doing is wrong. When Zigfried is disqualified and recruits Leon to help him with his plot to destroy KaibaCorp by playing a card in his Duel that will trigger a virus, Leon initially agrees, even though he doesn't feel right about it. Eventually during the Duel, he refuses to help Zigfried by playing the card because he doesn’t want to go against his morals. However, the virus was already unleashed, and the card could not be destroyed when Leon attempted to remove it from play. Yami Yugi then tried to help him destroy it while Seto Kaiba worked to stop the virus. 
 Vivian Wong :  A beautiful Duelist and the Asian Champion. She tends to space out in fangirly ways when she should be staying serious, and this often proves to be her downfall. At one point, she helped Solomon Muto with his hurt back, but only if he would help her bring Yugi to Duel her. When Yugi protested that it was against tournament rules since she had already been defeated, she hurt Solomon's back again and forced Yugi into the Duel, threatening that if he did not Duel her, she would not fix the damage. 
 Paul McGregor :  A Sherlock Holmes - dressed Duelist detective. 
 Fortune Salim :  A fortune-teller Duelist. He is tied up by Rex and Weevil, who used his robe to pose as him. He is later rescued and given back his outfit. Never given a chance to Duel. 
 Balfry Ginger :  A magician-themed Duelist; Known as the Master of Magic Cards. 
 Jafar Shin :  A Duelist from India. 
 Shane Jordan :  Cowboy-themed Duelist; Known as the Lone Dealer of the South West. 
 Totani Ialos :  An illusionist Duelist. 
 Abe the Monkey Man :  A wild man with a pet monkey, who helps him with his Duels. 
 Sergei Ivanoff :  Siberian strongman Duelist. 
 Ethan Shark :  Australian with a biker outfit Duelist. 
 Richard Goat :  Doctor and Duelist. Prone to medical puns.

After being tricked into playing " Golden Castle of Stromberg ", an illegal card, Leon also unwillingly releases a virus that begins erasing  KaibaCorp 's data. When Yugi deliberately thins his Deck into one card, he is able to destroy the illegal card and allow Leon to play fairly; however, he still loses the Duel when Yugi uses a combination of " Dark Magician ", " Necromancy ", and " Diffusion Wave-Motion ". It also turns out that  KaibaCorp  had backup data, eliminating the virus.
