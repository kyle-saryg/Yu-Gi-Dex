 Summary 
       Quattro  vanishing.     
 Shark  confronts  Quattro , saying that he finally found him. Quattro responds that he forgot Shark really is the biggest fan he has. Shark asks to repay the debt he owes Quattro. Quattro asks how Shark's "precious"  sister  is doing.  Yuma  looks perplexed as he didn't know Shark has a younger sister. Shark thinks back to the  National Duel Circuit , when Quattro set Shark up to see his Deck in the waiting room, leading to his disqualification. Shark blames himself for not being able to help his sister. Shark says he'll exact his revenge here and now and Yuma seems worried that Shark would Duel for revenge. Quattro agrees, responding that he really likes people like Shark. Before either can act, Trey deploys a  Duel Anchor , snaring Shark's wrist. Trey explains that Shark won't be able to escape without finishing a Duel with Trey. Quattro tells Trey that Shark is his prey and to get lost. Trey says that Shark's Deck has no " Numbers ", so there is no reason for Quattro to Duel him. He adds that  Vetrix 's orders are absolute. Quattro sighs and says that his "fanservice" is over. Quattro begins to walk off and Shark tells him to wait, asking if he's running away. Quattro shows a full  Heart Piece , saying he's already done collecting them as his  crest  glows. He tells Shark he'll wait for him in the finals and vanishes in a swirl of dust, cackling. Shark screams Quattro's name and Trey tells him to calm down, saying his brother is quite busy and they have their own Duel to conduct now.
 
       Yuma  thinks he is drowning.     
       Astral  explains what  Chronomaly  are, using the " Ancient Treasures " as a visual.     
 Astral  wonders just who these people are, thinking that that Duel Anchor is just like the one  Kite  uses. He speculates that these people are collecting "Numbers" using the same technical powers as Kite.  Bronk  and  Tori  help  Caswell  to his feet. They tell Yuma they'll take him to the hospital and urge him to stay and watch the Duel. Yuma begins to object, but Astral says he agrees. Shark arms his  D-Pad , saying he'll crush Trey first just as he wishes. Trey says "Duel Mode, Change!" and a gauntlet appears on his left arm. He throws a device out, which spins back at him and lands on the gauntlet in a wing-like formation - his D-Pad. Shark arms his  D-Gazer  and an orange D-Gazer tattoo appears around Trey's left eye. The two yell "Duel!" and Trey says he'll go first. Trey  activates  a  Field Spell Card  - " Sunken Kingdom ". A field of underwater ruins is manifested, complete with fish swimming through it as Trey explains that all  WATER   monsters  will gain 300  ATK . Yuma takes a huge breath and believes he's drowning, asking where his oxygen tank is. Astral reminds him that this is  Augmented Reality . Trey  Normal Summons  " Chronomaly Mayan Machine ",  Sets  a card and ends his  turn  (the Japanese name of the " Chronomaly " archetype is "OOPArts"). Yuma asks what  Chronomaly  are and Astral explains that they are works made by ancient civilizations who shouldn't have had the technology necessary to build them. He says their existence is still wrapped in mystery as images of " Crystal Skull ", " Cabrera Stone ", " Stonehenge " and " Ashoka Pillar " float by.
 Shark begins his turn, Normal Summoning " Hammer Shark ", whose ATK increases to 2000 due to "Sunken Kingdom". Shark muses that Trey must not have been aware that Shark plays a Water Deck. Trey explains that "Sunken Kingdom" has an additional effect - "Chronomaly" monsters cannot be  attacked  by  Level  4 or lower monsters. Shark asks if that's his insurance and activates " Falling Current ", decreasing the Level of "Hammer Shark" to 3. Trey says that Shark Duels strangely and asks what he's planning by lowering its Level. Shark  Special Summons  " Big Jaws " from his  hand  in  Attack Position  via its own  effect  as he activated a  Normal Spell Card  this turn. Its ATK increases to 2100 via "Sunken Kingdom". Trey says there are two Level 3 monsters. Shark  overlays  them to  Xyz Summon  " Black Ray Lancer " in Attack Position. Shark explains that  Xyz Monsters  have no Levels, so "Black Ray Lancer" can attack. Yuma complements Shark and "Black Ray Lancer" attacks and  destroys  "Mayan Machine" with " Black Spear ", dropping Trey to 3400  LP . Trey activates his  face-down  " Stonehenge Methods ", causing  Stonehenge  to rise from the sea. He explains that when a "Chronomaly" monster is destroyed, he can Special Summon a Level 4 or lower  Rock - Type  "Chronomaly" monster from his  Deck  in  Defense Position . He Special Summons " Chronomaly Colossal Head ". Shark Sets a card to end his turn.
 Trey  draws  and Normal Summons " Chronomaly Golden Jet ". He activates the " Orichalcum Chain "  Continuous Spell Card . He explains that when this card is  face-up  when he performs and Xyz Summon, he can use one less Overlay Unit than usually required. Shark is shocked and Trey comments that the card has risks too - should "Orichalcum Chain" be destroyed,  control  of the Summoned Xyz Monster will shift to Shark. Shark is surprised he'd take such a risk in order to Xyz Summon. Trey overlays his two Level 4 monsters, using one less Overlay Unit via "Orichalcum Chain" to Xyz Summon " Number 32: Shark Drake " in Attack Position. Yuma says "Numbers" and Astral says that it is indeed. The ATK of "Shark Drake" rises to 3100 via the effect of "Sunken Kingdom". "Shark Drake" attacks and destroys "Black Ray Lancer" with " Depth Bite ", dropping Shark to 3000 LP. Trey activates the effect of "Shark Drake"  detaching  an Overlay Unit to to Special Summon the destroyed monster back to Shark's  field  in Attack Position, with its ATK decreased by 1000. "Black Ray Lancer" appears with 1100 ATK. He explains that "Shark Drake" can then attack it again, and Yuma is surprised to see a "Number" that can do that. Astral says its more than just "attack twice" and calls it a very overpowered effect. Trey says "Shark Drake" will bite until its target has no bones left. "Shark Drake" attacks and destroys "Black Ray Lancer" again, reducing Shark to 1000 LP. Shark is thrown through the air by the attack, landing on his back. Yuma yells to him, asking if he's alright. Shark tells Yuma to shut up and asks if he honestly thinks he'll be defeated like this. Trey Sets a card and tells Shark that if he can't find a way to counter "Shark Drake", he won't escape. Yuma says he's right and Astral states that there is a way to bring about a reversal in these circumstances. Shark mutters that he needs to take that "Number" from Trey.
 
         The  effect  of " Skull Kraken "  destroys  " Orichalcum Chain ".     
         "Number 32" attempts to possess Shark.     
 Shark begins his turn, Normal Summoning " Skull Kraken ", who bursts from the ground. Its effect activates, letting him destroy one face-up  Spell  or  Trap Card . Black ink flows from the mouth of "Skull Kraken", obliterating "Orichalcum Chain". "Shark Drake" roars and moves to Shark's side of the field. Trey smirks, thinking its going as planned. That's the only thing Shark could do to survive. A purple aura appears around Shark as the "Number" begins to exert its influence over him and 32 appears on his hand. In his mind's eye, Shark faces "Shark Drake", who tells him to accept him. It plunges one of its talons through Shark's chest and he screams in pain (In the dub, Shark Drake just pokes him on the chest). The "Number" instructs him to accept it and release the darkness inside his heart. Shark remembers the times that Yuma reached out to him and when he  expressed  that there is nothing wrong with having a fear of losing. Shark yells that he's not the same as he used to be and the talon vanishes from his chest (the wound left by the talon is changed from blood-red to light green in the dub). He tells "Shark Drake" he'll never be controlled by the likes of it. "Shark Drake" roars and vanishes from his mind. Back at the Duel, "Shark Drake" remains on his field. Shark yells that he is who he is and Astral says that Shark managed to suppress the power of the "Number". Yuma is excited and Trey appears pleased that Shark wasn't possessed. "Shark Drake" attacks Trey  directly , with Yuma saying he'll hit for massive damage if he connects. Trey says he won't let that happen and activates his face-down " Antikythira Gear ". He explains that it can be activated when his opponent controls two or more monsters and attacks directly. Trey can take control of one of the opponent's monsters, switch it to Defense Position and make it the new  attack target . The gears rush towards "Skull Kraken", but Shark activates his face-down " Extreme Pressure Power ",  sending  "Skull Kraken" to the  Graveyard  and drawing a card. "Antikythira Gear" cannot take control of the monster that is attacking, so it  resolves  with no effect as Shark says his trap is useless. The attack continues and Trey is reduced to 300 LP and thrown onto his back. Shark Sets two cards. 
 
         Vetrix  instructing Trey to lose on purpose.     
         " Sunken Kingdom " above sea level.     
 Trey rises to his feet and complements Shark while thinking that his mission was to give Shark the "Number". He thinks back, remembering that Vetrix told him he could lose purposely once the mission was accomplished. He urges Shark not to get overconfident and draws. He activates " Chronomaly Technology ",  banishing  the "Mayan Machine" in his Graveyard to draw two cards and send the " Chronomaly Crystal Skull " in his hand to the Graveyard. He Special Summons " Chronomaly Crystal Bones " in Attack Position via its own effect as he controls no monsters while Shark does. Its effect activates, Special Summoning the "Chronomaly Crystal Skull" from his Graveyard in Attack Position. Trey overlays his two Level 3 monsters to Xyz Summon " Chronomaly Crystal Chrononaut " in Attack Position. Trey explains that by detaching an Overlay Unit, "Crystal Chrononaut" cannot be  destroyed by battle  this turn and any  Battle Damage  from battles involving it will be inflicted to his opponent. Trey smirks, saying the difference in ATK between "Shark Drake" and "Crystal Chrononaut" is 1000 - exactly the amount of LP Shark has left. "Crystal Chrononaut" attacks "Shark Drake" with " Reflect Flash ". Yuma is worried and Trey tells Shark that's it over. Shark activates his face-down " Plate Salvage ", causing the ruins of "Sunken City" to start floating upwards. He explains that it will  negate  the effect of Field Spell Cards for two cards. Now they are in the ruins, but on land. Yuma thinks its awesome that they're above sea level again. Since the effects of "Sunken Kingdom" are negated, the ATK of "Shark Drake" returns to 2800 and the attack continues, letting Shark survive with 300 LP. Astral thinks that was an amazing play. Yuma says they both only have 300 LP left and Astral muses that the next blow will decide the outcome. Trey is shocked that Shark survived "Reflect Flash", but determines that he will use the effect of "Shark Drake" during his next turn - and that is when the Duel will be decided. Trey Sets a card and ends his turn.
 
         Shark defeats Trey.     
 Shark immediately declares an attack with "Shark Drake". Yuma says its Shark's win and Trey tells them not yet. He activates the effect of the "Colossal Head" in his Graveyard, banishing it to change "Crystal Chrononaut" to Defense Position. "Crystal Chrononaut" is destroyed. Yuma says that's not good - no damage was inflicted. Astral tells him no and Shark activates the effect of "Shark Drake", detaching an Overlay Unit to Special Summon "Crystal Chrononaut" back to Trey's field with 1100 ATK. Shark asks if Trey thought he would forget the effect of "Shark Drake". Shark attacks with "Shark Drake" again and Trey tells him that fortunately, he hasn't underestimated Shark at all. He says he knew Shark would be able to control the "Number" and activates his face-down " Chronomaly Ley Line Power ", switching the ATK of the battling monsters. Trey says he wins and Shark smirks, saying he expected that. He claims he's the fortunate one - he didn't' underestimate Trey either.  Shark says he knew that Trey would expect him to use the effect of "Shark Drake". He activates his face-down " Sea King's Verdict ", negating "Chronomaly Ley Line Power" as it was activated during the  Battle Phase . Trey asks how that could be and curses. Shark tells "Shark Drake" to resume its attack. "Crystal Chrononaut" is destroyed and Trey's LP fall to 0. The Field Spell fades and Yuma is happy that Shark won. Astral calls the Duel a breathtaking display of offense and defense. Trey says he understands that Shark is quite good and that he lost - for today, at least. He tosses Shark a Heart Piece and holds up a full container of his own. He says it won't be easy for Shark if they meet again in the finals. Yuma is surprised Trey has already qualified too. Trey tells Shark to keep the "Number" and consider it a reward for winning the Duel. Trey's crest glows and he vanishes in a green light. Yuma's D-Gazer rings and he answers. Its Tori, who tells him they're at the hospital now and Caswell is holding up fine. Yuma says he'll be right over and then hears the engine of Shark's motorcycle roar. Shark tells Yuma not to get involved with him anymore and rides off. Yuma is worried about Shark Dueling for revenge. Astral observes that Yuma and Shark will Duel again eventually, since Shark has another "Number" now.
 
         Vetrix  explains the lingering effects of the "Numbers". (this shot is cut from the dub)     
 At Vetrix's headquarters, Trey approaches Vetrix, who tells him he did a good job. He complements him, saying he always completes the tasks Vetrix assigns. Trey says he just does everything he can for Vetrix and Vetrix comments that modesty is one of Trey's virtues as well. Trey informs him that Shark wasn't possessed by the "Number". Vetrix says that's not the case - the darkness that sleeps in a person's heart can come out as long as there is even the tiniest opening. It will slowly expand with their realization.
 
 Featured Duel: Shark vs. Trey 
 Turn 1: Trey 
 Trey  draws " Sunken Kingdom " and subsequently activates it. Now while this card is face-up, the  ATK  of all  WATER   monsters  will increase by 300. Trey  Normal Summons  " Chronomaly Mayan Machine " ( 3/1500/700) in Attack Position and  Sets  a card. 
 Turn 2: Shark 
 
                 Black Ray Lancer V2   " Black Ray Lancer " is Summoned.     
 Shark  draws. He then Normal Summons " Hammer Shark " ( 4/1700 → 2000/1500). Trey, at this point, explains, that "Sunken Kingdom" also prevents all  Level  4 or lower monsters from  attacking  " Chronomaly " monsters. Shark activates " Falling Current " to target "Hammer Shark" and declare Level 1 in order to decrease the Level of "Hammer Shark" by one ("Hammer Shark":   4 → 1). As Shark activated a  Normal Spell Card  this  turn , he  Special Summons  " Big Jaws " ( 3/1800 → 2100/300) from his  hand  in Attack Position via its own  effect . Shark  overlays  "Big Jaws" and "Hammer Shark" in order to  Xyz Summon  " Black Ray Lancer " ( 3/2100/600, ORU: 2) in Attack Position. 
 "Black Ray Lancer" attacks and  destroys  "Mayan Machine" (Trey: 4000 → 3400 LP). As a "Chronomaly" monster was destroyed, Trey activates his  face-down  " Stonehenge Methods " to Special Summon " Chronomaly Colossal Head " ( 4/800/1600) in  Defense Position  (as it's a Level 4 Rock-type "Chronomaly" monster). Shark Sets a card.
 Turn 3: Trey 
 
                 No. 32 Marine Biting Dragon - Shark Drake   " Number 32: Shark Drake " emerges.     Trey  draws  " Chronomaly Golden Jet " and subsequently Normal Summons it ( 4/1300/1400) in Attack Position. Trey then activates " Orichalcum Chain ". Now the next time he Xyz Summons, Trey may use one less Overlay Unit than required. However, if "Orichalcum Chain" is destroyed, Shark will gain control of the summoned Xyz Monster. Trey overlays "Chronomaly Colossal Head" and "Chronomaly Golden Jet" via "Orichalcum Chain" in order to Xyz Summon " Number 32: Shark Drake " ( 4/2800 → 3100/2100, ORU: 2) in Attack Position. 
 "Shark Drake" attacks and destroys "Black Ray Lancer" (Shark: 4000 → 3000 LP). Since "Shark Drake" destroyed a monster  by battle  and sent it to the Graveyard by attacking it, Trey activates the effect of "Shark Drake",  detaching  "Chronomaly Colossal Head" ("Shark Drake": 2 → 1 ORU) in order to Special Summon "Black Ray Lancer" from Shark's Graveyard to his side of the field in Attack Position with 1000 less ATK ( 3/2100 → 1100/600) and allow "Shark Drake" to attack that monster again. "Shark Drake" attacks and destroys "Black Ray Lancer" (Shark: 3000 → 1000 LP). Trey Sets a card.
 Turn 4: Shark 
Shark draws. He then Normal Summons " Skull Kraken " ( 3/600/1600) in Attack Position. As "Skull Kraken" was Normal Summoned, Shark activates its effect to destroy "Orichalcum Chain". Due to the second effect of "Orichalcum Chain", control of "Shark Drake" goes to Shark. 
 "Shark Drake" attacks  directly , but Trey activates his face-down " Antikythira Gear " to target "Skull Kraken" and take control of it as well as switch it to Defense Position due to Shark controlling at least two monsters and having declared a direct attack. Shark activates his face-down " Extreme Pressure Power " to destroy "Skull Kraken", send the latter to the Graveyard and draw one card, so "Antikythira Gear"  resolves  with no effect. The direct attack continues (Trey: 3400 → 300 LP). Shark Sets two cards.
 Turn 5: Trey 
 
                 OOPArts Crystal Alien   The Summoning of " Chronomaly Crystal Chrononaut ".     Trey draws. He then activates " Chronomaly Technology " to banish "Chronomaly Mayan Machine" from his Graveyard in order to draw two cards and send " Chronomaly Crystal Skull " from his hand to the Graveyard. 
 As Shark controls monsters and Trey does not, Trey Special Summons " Chronomaly Crystal Bones " ( 3/1300/400) from his hand in Attack Position via its own effect. Since Trey Special Summoned "Chronomaly Crystal Bones" through its own effect, he activates its second effect to revive "Chronomaly Crystal Skull" ( 3/900/600) in Attack Position. Trey overlays "Chronomaly Crystal Bones" and "Chronomaly Crystal Skull" in order to Xyz Summon " Chronomaly Crystal Chrononaut " ( 3/2100/1000, ORU: 2) in Attack Position. 
 Trey activates the effect of "Crystal Chrononaut", detaching an Overlay Unit ("Crystal Chrononaut": 2 → 1 ORU) in order to prevent it from being  destroyed by battle  and make Shark take any  Battle Damage  from  battles  involving it this turn. "Chronomaly Crystal Chrononaut" attacks "Shark Drake", but Shark activates his face-down " Plate Salvage " to  negate  the effects of all  face-up  Field Spell Cards for two turns ("Shark Drake": 3100 → 2800 ATK). "Chronomaly Crystal Chrononaut" is not destroyed and Shark takes the damage Trey would have taken (Shark: 1000 → 300 LP). Trey Sets a card.
 Turn 6: Shark 
Shark draws. "Shark Drake" attacks "Crystal Chrononaut", but Trey activates the effect of "Chronomaly Colossal Head" from his Graveyard, banishing it from his Graveyard in order to switch "Chronomaly Crystal Chrononaut" to Defense Position. "Shark Drake" then destroys "Chronomaly Crystal Chrononaut". Shark activates the effect of "Shark Drake", detaching "Chronomaly Golden Jet" ("Shark Drake": 1 → 0 ORU) in order to Special Summon "Chronomaly Crystal Chrononaut" from Trey's Graveyard to his side of the field in Attack Position with 1000 less ATK ( 3/2100 → 1100/1000) and allow "Shark Drake" to attack that monster again.
 "Shark Drake" attacks "Crystal Chrononaut", but Trey activates his face-down " Chronomaly Ley Line Power " to switch the ATK of both battling monsters. Shark activates his face-down " Sea King's Verdict " to negate the activation of "Chronomaly Ley Line Power" and destroy it since it was activated during the  Battle Phase . "Shark Drake" then destroys "Chronomaly Crystal Chrononaut" (Trey: 300 → 0 LP).
 
 Error 
         The old card backing in Trey's hand.     
 At one point, cards with the old backing can be seen in  Trey 's  hand  instead of those with the design that started with  this arc . 
 Trivia 
 Just like  Jaden Yuki  in  episode 38  of  Yu-Gi-Oh! GX ,  Yuma  believed he was drowning when a  Field Spell Card  that covered the field in water was  activated .
