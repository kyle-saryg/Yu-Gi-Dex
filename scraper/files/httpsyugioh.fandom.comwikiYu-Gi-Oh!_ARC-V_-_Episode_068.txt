 Featured Duel: Shinji Weber vs. Moon Shadow 
       Shinji  vs.  Moon .     
 At the start of the  Duel , the  Field Spell Card  " Crossover Acceleration " is  activated , as per the rules of an  Action Duel  and a  Turbo Duel . It will allow the players to use  Action Cards , but they may only have one in their  hand  at a time.
 Turn 1: Moon 
 Moon Shadow   Normal Summons  " Twilight Ninja Shingetsu " (1500/100). As he  controls  a " Ninja "  monster , Moon  activates  the  Continuous Spell Card , " Illusion Ninjitsu Art of Hazy Shuriken ". Whenever a card is  added  to his hand, Moon may  send  it to the  Graveyard  to inflict 300  damage  to  Shinji . If he does not control a "Ninja" monster, this card will  destroy  itself. Moon finds the  Action Card , " Evasion " and sends it to the Graveyard via this  effect  (Shinji: 4000 → 3700  LP ). Moon does this two more times, finding and sending the Action Cards "Evasion" and " Miracle " (Shinji: 3700 → 3400 → 3100 LP). Moon attempts to add another Action Card to his hand, but is blocked by Shinji, so neither player gets the card. Moon  Sets  a card.
 Turn 2: Shinji 
Shinji  draws  and Normal Summons " Battlewasp - Arbalest the Rapidfire " (1800/800). "Arbalest"  attacks  "Shingetsu", with Moon finding an Action Card. As he controls a "Ninja" monster, Moon activates his  face-down  " Illusion Ninjitsu Art of Hazy Toad ". Once per  turn  during his opponent's  Battle Phase , he can  discard  a card to increase the  ATK  of a "Ninja" monster he controls by 1000 until the end of the Battle Phase. If he controls no "Ninja" monsters, this card will destroy itself. He discards the Action Card "Evasion" ("Shingetsu": 1500 → 2500). The attack continues and "Arbalest" is destroyed (Shinji: 3100 → 2400 LP). As it was destroyed, the effect of "Arbalest" activates, letting Shinji  Special Summon  another copy of "Arbalest" (1800/800) from his hand in  Attack Position .
 Turn 3: Moon 
Moon draws and activates " Ninjitsu Art of Hazy Duplication ", letting him Special Summon a  Level  4 or lower "Ninja" monster from his hand. He Special Summons a second copy of "Shingetsu" (1500/100) in Attack Position. He then  Tributes  the second "Shingetsu" to  Tribute Summon  " Twilight Ninja Nichirin, the Chunin " (2300/1000). "Nichirin" attacks and destroys "Arbalest" (Shinji: 2400 → 1900 LP). As it was destroyed, the effect of "Arbalest" activates, letting Shinji Special Summon another copy of "Arbalest" (1800/800) from his hand in Attack Position.
 Turn 4: Shinji 
Shinji draws and Normal Summons " Battlewasp - Sting the Poison " (400/800). Shinji  tunes  the Level 4 "Arbalest" with the Level 2  Tuner monster  "Sting" to  Synchro Summon  the Level 6 " Battlewasp - Halberd the Charge " (2500/800) in Attack Position. "Halberd" attacks "Shingetsu", but Moon finds the Action Card "Miracle" and discards it via the effect of "Hazy Toad" ("Shingetsu": 1500 → 2500). As "Halberd" is attacking a monster that has equal to or higher ATK than it, Shinji activates the effect of "Halberd", halving the ATK of the  attack target  ("Shingetsu": 2500 → 1250). The attack continues and "Shingetsu" is destroyed (Moon: 4000 → 2750 LP). Shinji Sets a card.
 Turn 5: Moon 
When "Nichirin" is in on the  field , its effect treats it as a "Ninja" monster. Moon Tributes it to Tribute Summon " Twilight Ninja Getsuga, the Shogun " (2000/3000), which can be Tribute Summoned with 1 Tribute by Tributing a "Ninja" monster. Moon activates its effect, changing it to  Defense Position  to Special Summon two "Ninja" monsters from his Graveyard. He Special Summons both copies of "Shingetsu" (1500/100 each) in Attack Position. The effect of "Shingetsu" prevents Shinji from targeting other "Ninja" monsters for attacks. As Moon controls two of them, Shinji cannot attack at all. Moon finds the Action Card, "Evasion" and sends it to the Graveyard via the effect of "Hazy Shuriken" (Shinji: 1900 → 1600 LP). Moon does this twice more, finding two copies of the Action Card, "Evasion" and sending them to the Graveyard (Shinji: 1600 → 1300 → 1000 LP). Shinji finds an Action Card. Moon finds the Action Card "Miracle" and sends it to the Graveyard via the effect of "Hazy Shuriken", but Shinji activates the Action Card " Stand Up ", reducing the damage to 0 and ending Moon's turn immediately.
 Turn 6: Shinji 
Shinji draws and activates " Summoning Swarm " as his opponent controls a monster. This allows him to Special Summon a number of Level 4 or lower "Battlewasp" monsters from his Graveyard equal to the number of monsters his opponent controls. Moon controls three, so Shinji Special Summons two copies of "Arbalest" (1800/800 each) and one copy of "Sting" (400/800), all in Attack Position. Shinji activates the effect of "Sting", letting him Tribute a "Battlewasp" monster to  negate  the effects of a monster his opponent controls until the end of this turn. He Tributes an "Arbalest" to negate the effect of one of Moon's "Shingetsus", meaning he may now attack. "Arbalest" attacks and destroys the "Shingetsu" that did not have its effects negated (Moon: 2750 → 2450 LP) and "Halberd" attacks and destroys the second "Shingetsu" (Moon: 2450 → 1450 LP). Shinji activates his face-down " Urgent Tuning ", letting him conduct a Synchro Summon during the Battle Phase. Shinji tunes the Level 6 "Halberd" and the Level 4 "Arbalest" with the Level 2 Tuner monster "Sting" to Synchro Summon the Level 12 " Battlewasp - Ballista the Armageddon " (3000/???) in Attack Position. Shinji activates the effect of "Ballista", letting him  banish  all "Battlewasp" monsters from his Graveyard to reduce the ATK and  DEF  of a monster his opponent controls by 500 for each banished monster. He banishes three copies of "Arbalest", "Sting" and "Halberd" ("Getsuga": 2000/3000 → 0/500). Moon finds the Action Card "Evasion", but does not activate it. "Ballista" attacks and destroys "Getsuga", with the effect of "Ballista" inflicting  piercing   battle damage  (Moon: 1450 → 0 LP).
