 " Mermail Abyssgunde ", " Mermail Abysshilde ", " Mermail Abysslinde ", and the neck bracelet of " Poseidra, the Atlantean Dragon " (later to be the arm bracelet of " Mermail Abyssgaios ") appear in this card's artwork.
 The bracelet in this card's artwork is a reference to the eponymous ring of  Der Ring des Nibelungen . In the music dramas, the ring is described as being forged from gold that was guarded by the three  Rhinemaidens : Woglinde, Wellgunde, and Flosshilde (who correspond to "Mermail Abysslinde", "Mermail Abyssgunde", and "Mermail Abysshilde" respectively). 
 The Chinese name, "深淵呼喚" ("Abyss Call"), may be a mistranslation as the Japanese (アビスコール  Abisukōru ) and Korean (어비스콜  Eobiseukol ) names can be interpreted as "Abysscall" instead, which could be interpreted as referring to the  Special Summon  effect of this card.
