 First Level 
       Gate     
 As usual, some Duel spirits await the player at first.
 
 Thunder Nyan Nyan  (unlocks  Injection Fairy Lily ) 
 Absorbing Kid from the Sky  (unlocks  Marie the Fallen One ) 
 Soul of Purity and Light  will, like Molten Behemoth in the World of Civilization, offer the player a card if the player manages to Duel and win.
 Kaibaman  also appears here if the player has made a Deck with  Blue-Eyes White Dragon  in it, and requests that the player to summon the monster and beat him. If the player does so, it unlocks the real  Kaiba  in World Championship Mode.
 Layard the Liberator  guards the gate. The player will have to beat it using a Deck consisting of  Fairy - Type  monsters. By doing this it'll expand the map, and  Gellenduo  will come by talking about a card they lost.
 
 Second Level 
 Anyway, the player will find a couple more Duelists in the area.
 
 Royal Knight  (unlocks  Light Effigy ) 
 Freya, Spirit of Victory  (unlocks  Elemental Mistress Doriado ) 
 The player talks to both Nyan Nyan and Absorbing Kid. They will mention a strangely coloured cloud. A new Duelist,  Cloudian - Poison Cloud  will appear over the hole in the clouds. By beating it the player will be able to travel beneath the clouds to find more Duelists.
 
 Underground 
       Underground     
 When the player first Duels these Duelists, the player will be faced with certain conditions.
 
 Mokey Mokey  - 80 card Deck (unlocks  Petit Dragon ) 
 Dancing Fairy  - Start at 1000 LP (unlocks  Gemini Elf ) 
 Senju of the Thousand Hands  - Must win in 5 turns (unlocks  Manju of the Ten Thousand Hands ) 
 After beating every Duelist here at least once, the player challenges Senju again he'll say he picked something up, but will only give it to the player if the player beats him in 5 turns. The player's reward is the  Nova Summoner  card that Gellenduo has dropped.
 The player goes back out, and  Radiant Jeral  is waiting at the next gate - the player will have to Deck it out to win.
 
 Third Level 
 After the player is done,the gate will be opened. Up ahead is  Airknight Parshath  and a couple more of Duel spirits:
 
 Guardian Angel Joan  (unlocks  St. Joan ) 
 Marshmallon  (unlocks  Watapon ) 
 Courthouse 
         Courthouse     
 The player talks to Parshath and Parshath is worry about Gellenduo, as they were supposed to give him the Nova Summoner card. When the player gives him the card, he claims that the player stole it. It will eventually lead to the "Nova Summoner Robbery Case",  Voltanis the Adjudicator  will accuse the player of being guilty. To prove innocence, the player will end up in a Duel against Voltanis.
 Win or lose, the player will still be declared guilty until Gellenduo comes in and helps the player out. The player will be proven innocent and released. Voltanis will unlock in World Championship Mode regardless of the result, but winning is the only way to unlock  Airknight Parshath  and have a complete save file.
 
 Fourth Level 
 Up ahead at the next gate is  Harvest Angel of Wisdom , requesting that the player finishes him off by doing at least 8000 Life Points' worth of damage in a single turn. If the player does so, the next part of the map will be available.
 Card Trader  will also show up, and he does exactly as his name suggests - the player gives him a card, and he'll return the player a random card.
 
 Palace 
         Palace     
 Meltiel, Sage of the Sky  will approach the player and congratulate the player for making it this far, and states that there is a gate on top of this palace. However, to reach it the player will have to face several Duelists along the way, each with their own condition to meet:
