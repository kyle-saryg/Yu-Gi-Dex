 " Gakuting " is the fiftieth episode of the  Yu-Gi-Oh! SEVENS  anime. It will first air in Japan on May 30, 2021.
 The second match of the finals is between  Gavin  and  Nail ! Gavin thought that  Rayne  left the Neo Shingetsu Style behind because he wasn't good enough. In order to fight against the formidable Nail, Gavin has evolved his style into the Progressive Sogetsu Style!! The key of this style is... Gakuting!!
 
 Featured Duel: Gavin Sogetsu VS. Nail Saionji 
 The duel is conducted as a  Rush Duel .
 Turn 1: Gavin 
Gavin Normal Summons three copies of "Checkrael the Sun Angel, Yo" (1500/0) and sets two cards.
 Turn 2: Nail 
Nail activates the Spell "Protection of the Heavens". By sending any number of monsters from his hand to the GY, when the total Levels of the sent monsters equals or surpasses 10, Nail can draw two cards. He sends "Yggdrago the Heavenly Emperor Dragon Tree", which is Level 10. Due to the effect of "Protection of the Heavens", Nail draws two cards. Nail Normal Summons two copies of "Cycliptron" (100/1500). He then Tributes both "Cycliptrons" to Tribute Summon "Seedclotron Brusseln" (2400/1600). Nail activates the effect of "Seedclotron" by sending the top card of his deck to the GY, if the sent card is a Cyberse Monster: Nail can add monsters from his GY to his hand with 0 DEF up to the number of monsters on Gavin's field. The sent card is "Yggdrago the Heavenly Emperor Dragon Tree (L)" which is a Cyberse Monster, so Nail adds both "Yggdrago the Heavenly Emperor Dragon Tree (L)" and "Yggdrago the Heavenly Emperor Dragon Tree" from the GY to his hand. Nail sets a card. He then Maximum Summons "Yggdrago the Heavenly Emperor Dragon Tree (L)" (900/0), "Yggdrago the Heavenly Emperor Dragon Tree (R) (600/0) and "Yggdrago the Heavenly Emperor Dragon Tree" (2000/0). (He removes "Seedclotron Brusseln" from the field in order to do this, though this isn't mentioned.) They are treated as one monster and their ATK becomes their Maximum ATK ("Yggdrago" 2000/0 → 4000/0). Nail activates the effect of "Yggdrago the Heavenly Emperor Dragon Tree" granted from "Yggdrago the Heavenly Emperor Dragon Tree (L) by sending the top 3 cards of his deck to the GY, now Nail can target one Level 8 or lower monster on Gavin's field and destroy it, he targets and destroys one copy of "Checkrael the Sun Angel, Yo". "Yggdrago the Heavenly Emperor Dragon Tree" attacks and destroys one of the remaining "Checkrael the Sun Angel, Yos" (Gavin: 4000 → 1500 LP).
 Turn 3: Gavin 
Gavin Normal Summons "Hero is the Yeet" (1500/0). He then Tributes "Hero is the Yeet" and the final "Checkrael the Sun Angel, Yo" to Tribute Summon "Demonic Hermit Vessel Cartiszark" (2100/2100). Gavin activates the Spell "Wicked Warding Weasel's Wind" which increases the ATK of "Cartiszark" by 1000 until the End Phase ("Cartiszark": 2100/2100 → 3100/2100). "Wicked Warding Weasel's Wind" also allows Nail to change monsters on his field to Defense Position, but Maximum Monsters can't change battle position so nothing else happens. Gavin activates the effect of "Cartiszark" by sending a monster from his hand to the GY (he sends "Yameruler"), now "Cartiszark" gains 1000 ATK until the End Phase ("Cartiszark" 3100/2100 → 4100/2100) and since the sent monster was a Warrior or a Winged Beast Monster, Gavin can add 1 Level 6 or lower monster from his GY to his hand. He adds "Hero is the Yeet" and subsequently Normal Summons it again (1500/0). Gavin sets a card. "Cartiszark" attacks "Yggdrago" but Nail activates the Trap "Annihilation" to prevent either of the battling monsters from being destroyed by battle this turn but Nail still takes damage (Nail: 4000 → 3900 LP). During the End Phase, the effects of "Cartiszark" and "Wicked Warding Weasel's Wind" expire ("Cartiszark" 4100/2100 → 2100/2100).
 Turn 4: Nail 
Gavin pays 1000 LP to activate the Trap "Collective Bowing" (Gavin: 1500 → 500 LP) which allows Gavin to change the monsters on his field to face-up Defense Position. Nail activates the effect of "Yggdraco the Heavenly Emperor Dragon Tree" granted from "Yggdrago the Heavenly Emperor Dragon Tree (R)" to send the top 3 cards of his deck to the GY to change one Defense Position monster on Gavin's field to Attack Position. He changes "Hero is the Yeet" to Attack Position. Gavin sends the top card of his deck to the GY to activate the Trap "Demonic Forest's Demon Squadron-Z" to switch "Hero is the Yeet" back into Defense Position and it can't be destroyed by battle this turn. Nail activates the effect of "Yggdrago the Heavenly Emperor Dragon Tree" granted from "Yggdrago the Heavenly Emperor Dragon Tree (L)" to send the top 3 cards of his deck to the GY to target and destroy one Level 8 or lower monster on Gavin's field. He targets and destroys "Hero is the Yeet". Nail discards one card to activate the Spell "Tribute to the Doomed". "Tribute to the Doomed" targets and destroys one monster on the field. He targets and destroys "Demonic Hermit Vessel Cartiszark". "Yggdrago" attacks directly but Gavin sends the top card of his deck to the GY to activate the Trap "Refined Rulers - The Three Fiendish Commanders", which can only be activated in response to an opponent declaring a direct attack. It allows Gavin to gain 1000 LP (Gavin: 500 → 1500 LP) and since Gavin's GY contains all three "Demonic Generals" ("Demonic General Yameruler", "Demonic General "Kimeruler" and "Demonic General Semeruler") he can return them to his deck and since all three were returned both players take damage equal to the ATK of the attacking monster: 4000 (Nail: 3900 → 0 LP, Gavin: 1500 → 0 LP).
