 Personality 
 Chills is a typical gang member, being overly rude and cruel even to members of his gang. He shows an immense level of loyalty to his partner,  Scorch  (calling him "Nii-chan" in the Japanese version, meaning "brother"), and bases his Deck around defending Scorch in a Duel.
 
 Biography 
 Their gang took in  Reginald Kastle  after he quit Dueling. When  Yuma Tsukumo ,  Tori Meadows , and  Bronk Stone  entered their  arcade  hideout looking for Shark, Chills grabbed Yuma by the ankle when he tried to come to Bronk's aid after Scorch had grabbed Bronk, and held him upside down. Shark told the brothers to let the group go. [1] 
 Scorch and Chills later learned of a rare deck being put on display in a museum, featuring " Chaos End Ruler - Ruler of the Beginning and the End ", and set out to steal it with Reginald in tow after he'd heard them threatening  Weasel . Weasel informed Yuma of their attempt, allowing Yuma to challenge them both to a Duel. Reginald teamed up with Yuma, making it a 2-on-2  Tag-Team Duel . [2]  After Chills Summoned " Freezadon ", Reginald correctly guessed that he and Scorch cheated by turning off their  D-Pad 's  shuffling  function and placing their cards in a set order so that they know which cards they and their partner would  draw . Chills was eliminated from the Duel after saving Scorch from being defeated by Shark. After he and Scorch lost the two thugs ran away from Reginald in fear, having lost the influence of the " Numbers " cards. [3] 
 
 Deck 
 Chills' Deck is constructed with  Ice-themed   Dinosaur  cards. Chills'  monsters  are all  WATER - Attribute  with ice and blizzard theme,  focusing on defense and Summoning  Level  5 monsters to work in  Tag-Team Duels  with Scorch in order to  Xyz Summon  his ace monster, " Number 19: Freezadon ". All of his Dinosaur monsters have the "-don" suffix while Scorch's dinosaurs have the "-saurus" suffix. His Deck is designed to support and defend Scorch, featuring cards that  negate  and redirect  attacks , allowing Scorch to continue his offensive strategy.
