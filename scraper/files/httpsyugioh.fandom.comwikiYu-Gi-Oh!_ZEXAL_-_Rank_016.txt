 Summary 
 Cologne  plays theater using  Yuma  and  Captain Corn  dolls. She plays Yuma as being a villain controlled by  the evil  of  Astral World , and defeating Corn with an "evil fart". Then,  Thunder Spark  arrives to avenge Corn, but Yuma defeats him as well, declaring now he'll dominate the world. But at this time, Cologne herself appears, saying she is the Warrior of Justice and Love, and defeats Yuma. At that time,  Mr. Heartland  watches Yuma and his friends, and seeing that they managed to defeat Thunder Spark as well, he orders Cologne to defeat Yuma. She hesitates, but Mr. Heartland threatens her, saying that if she doesn't, she will go back to normal - a pitiful doll who was abandoned and sent to the disposal plant of  Heartland . Cologne immediately decides to defeat Yuma.         Cologne  plays with  Yuma  and  Captain Corn  dolls.     
         Kotori  and  Cathy  borrow Cologne's clothes.     
 After jumping into the  Speed Field 's river field in order to save Yuma,  Kotori  and  Cathy  are soaked. They are inside a dark stone building, and notice a door in the opposite site of the building. It appears to be a dressing room, full of girls' clothes. Both girls take a dry dress to wear.  Tetsuo  comments that the girls kept arguing the whole way to there, and that its odd how they suddenly look like friends, while  Takashi  says that the situation shows how complicated a girl can be. Cathy and Kotori then ask Yuma if they are cute with that clothes, and start arguing about that. Seeing that the girls have a good relationship, but keep arguing, Astral comments that its seems to be complicated to maintain a friendship. Takashi and  Tokunosuke  then notice a big door there, which they all pass by, entering a dark room, decorated with lots of creepy dolls, and featuring a big stairway leading to a  Doll House .
 
         Enraged, Cologne sets the field on fire.      Tokunosuke is scared of the dolls, and screams. Suddenly, Cologne comes down the stairs, holding a candlestick. She welcomes them to her  House of Dolls , and Astral notes she is Princess Cologne, who was known as the mascot of Heartland. They then notice she was also an enemy, and she confirms it, saying that Yuma and Astral won't get out of there. But when Cathy replies saying that a short like her cannot intimidate them, Cologne notices Kotori and Cathy are using her clothes. The girls try to excuse themselves, but Cologne doesn't listen to them, and enraged, throws the candlestick, which surrounds them with flames, and challenges Yuma to a  Duel .
 Astral advises Yuma not to let his guard down, as she looks even more resolved than the other two assassins, while she takes the first  turn . When she Summons her " Toy Box " and  destroys  it with " Mix-Up ", Yuma and Astral get confused on how she destroyed her own monster, but then get shocked seeing thanks to that she managed to Summon four  monsters  in her first turn. However, as she explains that she couldn't  overlay  them due to the  effect  of "Toy Box", they get relieved. Then, when Yuma uses " Zubaba Knight " with " Shadow Clone Zone ", creating four copies of him, and destroying Cologne's " Doll Monsters ", Kotori says that she feels sorry for the cute dolls, while Yuma replies saying that those are his opponent's monsters after all. Cathy cheers Yuma on, but when she was going to say that if he defeated Cologne she'd be able to keep the attire, the others stare her, and she instead says that she will return it. Cologne then activates the effect of the  Field Spell Card  " Doll House ", as Astral confirms that the field they are in indeed had a kind of special effect. They notice the destroyed dolls came back with parts of another of them added to their bodies, and Cologne says that if Yuma "breaks" her dolls,  Grandpa Demetto  will fix them for her. Tokunosuke then notices a craftsman sitting on the doll house from where Cologne showed up, and they realize that man is Demetto, but comment about his bad appearance, making Cologne scream that  Grandpa Demetto  is always doing his best to fix the dolls, and that she won't allow them to treat him as a fool. Astral tells Yuma to keep his concentration, as she now has three  Level  6 monsters, but they get surprised seeing that instead of overlaying them, she sent her own monsters to be destroyed by Yuma's "Zubaba Knight", taking considerable damage. Astral says that it is dangerous to let two Level 8 monsters in Cologne's field, so Yuma manages to Summon " No. 50: Black Ship of Corn ", in order to destroy them. However, at that time, Cologne smiles, and says that she will now show the power of " Frankie ".
