 Summary 
 Featured Duel: Shoma Yusa vs. Ms. Guide 
 Turn 2: Shoma Yusa 
Shoma  activates  the  effect  of " Gaia the Magical Knight of Dragons ", reducing its  ATK  by 2600 to  destroy  a  monster  of his choice. Shoma targets Ms. Guide's " Adamancipator Analyzer " ("Gaia": 7800 → 5200 ATK). Shoma then  sets  two cards.
 Turn 3: Ms. Guide 
Ms. Guide draws " Adamancipator Researcher ", while her  hand  contains " Adamancipator Seeker ", " Doki Doki ", " Adamancipator Signs " and " Sentry Soldier of Stone ". Shoma activates his set " Beginning of Heaven and Earth "  Normal Trap Card , which lets him reveal three  Warrior  monsters - " Gaia The Fierce Knight ", " Black Luster Soldier - Envoy of the Beginning " and " Soldier Gaia The Fierce Knight " - while Ms. Guide randomly chooses one card - "Soldier Gaia" - to be be added to his  hand , and the rest of the revealed cards are sent to the  GY . Shoma's hand also contains " Keeper of Dragon Magic ".
 Ms. Guide activates "Adamancipator Signs"  Normal Spell Card , which lets her  Special Summon  " Adamancipator Risen - Dragite " from her GY in  Attack Position , while also placing the "Doki Doki" monster in her hand to the top of her  Deck . "Adamancipator Laputite" increases the ATK and DEF of  Rock  monsters by 500 ("Risen Dragite": 3000 → 3500 ATK/2200 → 2700 DEF). Shoma uses the effect of "Gaia the Magical Knight of Dragons", reducing its ATK by 2600 to destroy "Risen Dragite" ("Gaia": 5200 → 2600 ATK).
 The following moments of the turn were not shown, but were explained at the end of the chapter: 
 
 Ms. Guide Normal Summons "Adamancipator Seeker", then, as she controls a Rock monster, she Special Summons "Researcher" ( Level  2/100 → 600/2100 → 2600). She then activates the effect of "Researcher" to  excavate  top five cards of her Deck, and Special Summon "Doki Doki" among them (Level 2/500 → 1000/500 → 1000), and place the rest on the top of her Deck in any order. She then  discards  "Sentry Soldier of Stone" to have "Doki Doki" Special Summon a second copy of it (Level 3/1300 → 1800/2000 → 2500), since that Rock monster shares the same Level and  Attribute  with the discarded monster. She uses the effect of " Crystal Dragite " in her GY, returning "Risen Dragite" in her GY to her  Extra Deck  to place the former to the top of her Deck. As she controls an " Adamancipator " monster, Ms. Guide Special Summons "Seeker" in Attack Position ("Seeker": 1200 → 1700 ATK/1000 → 1500 DEF), then uses that card's effect to excavate five cards, Special Summon "Crystal Dragite" in  Defense Position  and return the rest to the top of her Deck in any order ("Crystal Dragite": 0 → 500 ATK/2200 → 2700 DEF). As "Crystal Dragite" was Special Summoned, Ms. Guide draws one card. 
 Ms. Guide controls "Adamancipator Seeker", "Adamancipator Researcher", "Sentry Soldier of Stone", "Adamancipator Crystal - Dragite" and "Doki Doki". Shoma activates his set card, " Spiral Reborn " Normal Trap Card, which lets him revive " Curse of Dragon, the Cursed Dragon ", whose effect lets him add a card that supports "Gaia The Fierce Knight" - " Galloping Gaia " - from his Deck to his hand. Ms. Guide activates the effect of "Adamancipator Laputite", excavating five cards and rearraging them to the top of her Deck in any order; the cards she takes are "Adamancipator Seeker", "Adamancipator Laputite", "Adamancipator Signs", "Adamancipator Crystal - Leonite" and "Adamancipator Crystal - Dragite".
 Ms. Guide tunes the Level 2 "Adamancipator Researcher" with the Level 2 "Doki Doki" and Level 4 "Adamancipator Crystal - Dragite",  Synchro Summoning  "Adamancipator Risen - Dragite" in Attack Position. Shoma activates the effect of "Soldier Gaia the Fierce Knight", tributing "Gaia the Magical Knight of Dragons" to Special Summon it in Attack Position (Level 8/2600/2100). The effect of "Soldier Gaia" shifts "Risen Dragite" to Defense Position. Due to the effect of "Risen Dragite", Ms. Guide excavates top five cards of her Deck, and  returns  Shoma's monsters - "Soldier Gaia" and "Curse of Dragon, the Cursed Dragon" - to his hand. As Ms. Guide controls only Rock monsters, she Special Summons "Sentry Soldier of Stone" to Attack Position, then has the two copies of it, as well as "Adamancipator Seeker", attack Shoma directly (Shoma Yusa: 8000 → 2700 LP). Ms. Guide's hand contains " Catapult Zone ".
 The following moments of the turn were not shown, but were explained at the end of the chapter: 
 
 Ms. Guide tunes the Level 2 "Seeker" with the Level 3 "Sentry Soldier", Synchro Summoning "Accel Synchron" (Level 5/500/2100). Ms. Guide activates the latter's effect, increasing the Level of the monster she sends from her Deck to the GY: she selects the Level 1 "Jet Synchron". She then sends "Catapult Zone" from her hand to the GY to resurrect "Jet Synchron" (Level 1/500/0), then tunes that Level 1 monster with the second copy of Level 3 "Sentry Soldier" to Synchro Summon " Old Entity Hastorr " (Level 4/2300/1000). 
 Ms. Guide controls "Old Entity Hastorr", "Adamancipator Risen - Dragite" and "Accel Synchron".
 Turn 4: Shoma Yusa 
Shoma draws " Lord Gaia the Fierce Knight ". Ms. Guide activates the effect of her Level 6 "Accel Synchron", tuning it with "Old Entity Hastorr" to Synchro Summon " Shooting Star Dragon T.G. EX " (Level 10/3300/2500). Shoma activates "Galloping Gaia", then plays its effect to add " Gaia the Magical Knight " from his Deck to his hand. As he controls no monsters, yet his opponent does, Shoma Special Summons "Lord Gaia the Fierce Knight" from his hand in Attack Position (Level 7/23000/2100). Next, as Ms. Guide controls a monster with more than 2300 ATK, Shoma Normal Summons "Gaia the Magical Knight" without tributing monsters. As the latter has been successfully summoned, it enables Shoma to Special Summon "Cursed Dragon" from his GY, which then lets Shoma add a card that supports "Gaia The Fierce Knight"; Shoma selects and activates " Spiral Fusion ". Ms. Guide activates the effect of "Risen Dragite" to negate the activation and destroy that card.
 Shoma uses "Lord Gaia" and "Magical Gaia" to  Link Summon  " Predaplant Verte Anaconda " (500/ Link -2/↙↘). Shoma pays 2000 LP and sends the third copy of "Spiral Fusion" from his Deck to the GY to play the latter's effect, using "Magical Gaia" and "Cursed Dragon" to  Fusion Summon  a second copy of "Gaia the Magical Knight of Dragons" with 2600 extra ATK, since it has its name treated as " Gaia the Dragon Champion " ("Gaia the Magical Knight of Dragons": 2600 → 5200 ATK; Shoma: 2700 → 700 LP). As "Curse of Dragon, the Cursed Dragon" has left the field, Shoma plays its effect to  negate  all of Ms. Guide's monster effects, since their ATK is lower than that of "Gaia the Magical Knight of Dragons". "Gaia the Magical Knight of Dragons" attacks and destroys "Star Dragon Expansion" (Ms. Guide: 1400 → 0 LP).
