 Biography 
 Kujirada's Digital Pet was a Hidden Pet, which is a rare type of Digital Pet that lives much longer than regular pets and has other superior properties. Such pets are identified by having a star in their graphics. [1] 
 Kujirada's pet became more of a master than a pet towards Kujirada and often kept him awake, demanding to be fed. Kujirada began feeding other pets to him, including  Peachy . He tried feeding it  U2 , but using the data it incorporated from  Joe , U2 defeated and destroyed Kujirada's pet. [1] 
 Despite the loss of a powerful Pet, Kujirada was happy that he would at least get some sleep. [1]
