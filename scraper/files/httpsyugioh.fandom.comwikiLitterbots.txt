 Litterbots , known as  Obots  in the Japanese version, are robots in the  Yu-Gi-Oh! ZEXAL  anime.
 They are designed to detect and collect trash around  Heartland City . When they  find trash, they yell "Garbage!" or "Trash!", then they grab and "eat" it while yelling "Cleaning!". In the dub, they say "Trash identified". Each Litterbot has a number painted on some part of its body. They also appear to have a special  D-Pad  version each.
 They are often used as comic relief, namely giving  Yuma Tsukumo  a hard time (Yuma crashing into them, confusing Yuma and his Deck as garbage more than once, easily defeating him in a duel, etc.). [1] 
 They also appear to be used for other purposes such as when they were seen pushing luggage trolleys around  Heartland Airport  for the  World Duel Carnival  participants, and helping with construction work and directing machinery. Litterbots where also used during the inauguration parade of the WDC.  [2] 
 When Yuma Dueled  Striker  in his first duel of the WDC, Striker's " Stadium of Dreams " Field Spell caused a nearby Litterbot to function like a referee, blowing a whistle to simulate a penalty when Striker activated his " Offside Trap ".
 
       Litterbot in fighting form.     
 Hart Tenjo  has the power to send the trash they collect to the  Astral World  under the orders of  Mr. Heartland  and  Dr. Faker . The trash damages the Astral World. [3] 
 They also seem to have a fighting form similar to  Orbital 7 's, which were shown when they were reprogrammed by  Goda  to rob a  jewelery store [4]  and when they attacked  Kite ,  Shark  and  Tori . [5]
