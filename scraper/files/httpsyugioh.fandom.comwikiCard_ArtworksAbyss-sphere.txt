 The international artwork of this card is edited so that " Mermail Abysslinde " no longer has her hand around her neck. It also removes the distressed expression on her face and the oxygen bubbles coming from her mouth, to avoid any connotation of drowning. Her lower belly is also covered up more to keep consistency with her own international artwork.
