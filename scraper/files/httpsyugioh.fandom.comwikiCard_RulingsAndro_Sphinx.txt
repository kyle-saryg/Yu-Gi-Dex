 OCG Rulings 
 If " Andro Sphinx " and " Sphinx Teleia " are destroyed in the middle of a  chain  - for example, if a card is activated and " Mystical Space Typhoon " is  chained  and destroys " Pyramid of Light " - then you cannot Special Summon " Theinen the Great Sphinx ". [1] 
 This monster is not a  Special Summon monster . [2] 
 If there are multiple copies of " Andro Sphinx " or " Sphinx Teleia " on the field when " Pyramid of Light " is removed from the field, then all copies of " Andro Sphinx " and " Sphinx Teleia " are destroyed and removed from play. [3] 
 Mentions in Other Rulings 
 If " Pyramid of Light " is negated by " Royal Decree " etc when it is removed from the field, then the " Sphinx " cards are not destroyed. [3] 
 When " Pyramid of Light " is removed from the field, the effect which destroys the " Sphinx " cards does not start a  chain . [3] 
 Previously Official Rulings 
   These TCG rulings were issued by  Upper Deck Entertainment  and have since been deemed unofficial by Konami. [4]  They were previously considered official and can still be correct, as long as they follow the official gameplay rules, or unless Konami has issued a ruling that says otherwise. References:  [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] 
 
 This card’s effect which allows you to  Special Summon  it is a  Spell Speed 1  effect that you can only  activate  during your  Main Phase 1  or  2 . 
 Mentions in Other Rulings 
 Last Turn : If " Pyramid of Light ", " Andro Sphinx ", and " Sphinx Teleia " are all sent to the  Graveyard  by " Last Turn ", " Theinen the Great Sphinx " is not  Special Summoned  because the effect of " Pyramid of Light "  activates  its effect, but then looks for " Andro Sphinx " and " Sphinx Teleia " and does not find them on the  field , so it cannot  destroy  them with its effect. 
 Theinen the Great Sphinx : The effect of  Summoning  " Theinen the Great Sphinx " is a  Trigger Effect , so you may do it during your opponent's turn if " Andro Sphinx " and " Sphinx Teleia " are  destroyed  simultaneously.
