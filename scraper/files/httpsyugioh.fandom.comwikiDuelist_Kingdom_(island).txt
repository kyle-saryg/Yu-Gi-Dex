 History 
 During the  Pacific War , the island was occupied by the U.S. military. Troops that died were buried in the caves under the island.
 Maximillion Pegasus  later came into ownership of the island and used as his own private residence. He sometimes invited others over to discuss business deals.  Seto Kaiba  visited the island to celebrate the completion of the holographic  Duel Monsters  technology, and  Duke Devlin  went to demonstrate  Dungeon Dice Monsters  to Pegasus.
 Pegasus and  The Big Five  brought  Mokuba  there after kidnapping him in the  Duelist Kingdom arc  as they attempted to gain control of  KaibaCorp .
 Pegasus used the island to host the  Duelist Kingdom  tournament. For the tournament, he had various  Dueling Arenas  ( Battle Boxes  in the manga) set up across the island. During the tournament, Kaiba made his way to the island to take Mokuba back. Pegasus forced Kaiba to Duel both Yugi and him for the chance to save Mokuba. After Pegasus lost to Yugi at the end of the tournament,  Yami Bakura  attacked him and stole his  Millennium Eye . In the manga, this killed Pegasus.
 
 Locations 
 Pegasus Castle 
 Main article:  Pegasus Castle 
       Pegasus Castle.     
 Pegasus Castle was situated on the top of a hill. In the anime, it was given a much longer staircase to the top. The Duelist Kingdom tournament finals took place here. To gain entry, a duelist must insert 10  Star Chips  into a lock. This rule also applied to visitors wishing to see Pegasus during the tournament, including  Seto Kaiba .
 
 
 Underground 
       The maze in the underground     
 The island has underground caverns.  Bandit Keith  managed to find the way into them. He and his goons ganged-up on  Joey Wheeler  and pulled him into them.
 Inside the caverns were two main passages; one led to the graveyard, and the other led to the labyrinth. In the anime, the tunnels were lined with traps, such as a fake giant boulder, which rolled through the tunnels after someone stepped on a trap.
 Joey was forced to Duel against  Bonz  in the graveyard. After he won, Keith had Bonz,  Sid  and  Zygor  trap Joey and his friends inside by pushing a large boulder in front of the entrance. To escape, they had to make their way to the labyrinth. Bakura was able to navigate through the tunnels in the direction of Pegasus castle, since his  Millennium Ring  was pointing at Pegasus'  Millennium Eye .
 
 
 Graveyard 
         The graveyard.     
 The graveyard, called the crypt in the manga, was where Joey was forced to Duel Bonz. The area was lined with skulls and gravestones. In the manga it had a  Battle Box , while in the anime it had a  Dueling Arena .  Zombie - Type  monsters were given a  Field Power Bonus  here.
 Bonz was given an advantage, since he made a Zombie Deck beforehand, but Joey managed to beat him.
 
 Labyrinth 
 The edges of the tunnel become smoother and straighten out into solid walls as the tunnels become the labyrinth maze.
 Past the maze is another dueling arena, where the  Eliminators , the  Paradox Brothers , waited. This arena was set up for  Labyrinth Duels . Past them was the exit to surface just outside the castle. In order to leave, entrants must defeat the Paradox Brothers in a Duel and choose from one of two doors, only one of which they said led out. In reality, both doors went to the same place, and the brothers tried to trick the players into thinking whichever door they picked was the wrong one.
