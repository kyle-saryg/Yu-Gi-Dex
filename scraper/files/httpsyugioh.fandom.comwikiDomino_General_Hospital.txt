 Events 
       The damage from the Shadow Duel.     
 Jack Atlas  was sent their shortly after losing his title as King and needed treatment for injuries sustained in the title Duel. The paparazzi were denied entry, but  Carly Carmine  managed to disguise as a nurse and sneak in.  Trudge , possessed by the  Dark Signers , also managed to get in and challenge Jack Atlas to a  Shadow Duel . Jack, unfit to duel with his injuries, got Carly to help him, by making the moves he tells her. The Shadow Duel caused explosions, damaging the building. The explosions were caught on camera, by the reporters, but cause was made unknown, since  Mina Simington  took the security tape to protect Trudge.
 Akiza Izinski  was treated here, when she was left unconscious after the  Dark Signers  attack on the  Arcadia Movement  building. The media didn't know who the girl admitted was and asked the Senator  Hideo  why he was visiting. Hideo later brought Yusei over to help wake Akiza up. After she did, Akiza wound-up engaging in a Duel against Yusei.
 Akiza visited  Haluna  here shortly before Haluna's discharge date to congratulate her on her recovery. [1]
