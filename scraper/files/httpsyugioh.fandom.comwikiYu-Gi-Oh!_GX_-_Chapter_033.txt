 The Final Round...!! 
 
 "Ultimate Hero!!"  is the thirty-third chapter of the  Yu-Gi-Oh! GX  manga . It was first printed in Japanese in  V Jump  magazine and in English in  Shonen Jump  magazine. Both of which were printed in  volume 5  of the  Yu-Gi-Oh! GX  graphic novels afterwards.
 
 Summary 
 Chazz Princeton 's " Dark End Dragon " attacks  Jaden Yuki 's " Elemental Hero Frost Blade ", dealing  piercing  damage via the  effect  of " Dragon's Wrath ".  Reggie MacKenzie  begins a confrontation with  Midori Hibiki , and Reggie asks if there's anything Midori might want to know. She wants to know about the spirit cards and  Shadow Games . Before she can mention it herself, Reggie asks if Midori would like to know what happened to  her brother , confirming Midori's suspicions that her brother's fall was related to the Shadow Games. Reggie agrees to answer, but tells Midori she must defeat her in a duel first. Midori will find out by experiencing a Shadow Game herself. Midori accepts her challenge.
 Back at the arena, Chazz  Sets  a card to end his turn. Jaden knows he's in a fix, and was not expecting "Dragonic Enrage". He has no cards in his hand that can help, and  draws  " Spell Books from the Pot ". Playing it is a risk, as both players will draw three cards, but he has to take it. He draws " Polymerization " and two other unseen cards, while Chazz draws " Light End Dragon " and two other cards. Jaden plays "Polymerization", fusing "Frost Blade" with the " Elemental Hero Ocean " in his hand to  Fusion Summon  " Elemental Hero Absolute Zero " in  Attack Position . Chazz recognizes the card as most powerful Hero that  Koyo Hibiki  had before he became world champion and obtained " Elemental Hero Terra Firma ". Chazz had witnessed Koyo's championship match that day. One year later, he had received Koyo's autograph, and that's when  Light and Darkness Dragon  first appeared to him. That was when he made his vow to be a duelist. Jaden yells at Chazz to stop spacing out and plays " Element Conversion ", which switches the  attribute  of all monsters on the field to  WATER . "Absolute Zero" gains 500 for every WATER monster on the Field besides itself, so its attack points rise to 3500. Chazz knows that Koyo himself never used this combo, it's an original tactic of Jaden's.
 "Absolute Zero" attacks and destroys "Dark End Dragon", with Chazz activating his face-down " Dragon's Lair ", Special Summoning "Light End Dragon" from his hand. Chazz decides that the Deck is no longer Koyo's - it's the soul of Jaden. He doesn't want to lose to him again, as Jaden is aiming for the same goal that Chazz is, reaching the pinnacle of the dueling world, just as Koyo did. Jaden Sets a card to end his turn. Chazz activates "Light End's" effect, decreasing its attack points by 500 to decrease the attack of "Absolute Zero" by 1500. "Light End" attacks and destroys "Absolute Zero", with Jaden activating his face-down " Residual Reflection ", reducing the  Battle damage  to zero by removing "Frost Blade" and "Ocean" in his Graveyard from play. Chazz Sets a card to end his turn, and Jaden draws " Parallel World Fusion ". He recalls that Koyo only ever dueled him seriously once, but it was the single duel that made him decide that he wanted to be a duelist. He plays "Parallel World Fusion", returning the "Ocean" and " Elemental Hero Woodsman " that are removed from play to his  Deck  to Fusion Summon "Terra Firma" in Attack Position.

 Turn 5: Jaden 
Jaden draws " Spell Books from the Pot " and subsequently activates it, letting both players  draw  three cards. He the activates " Polymerization ", fusing " Elemental Hero Frost Blade " on his  field  with the " Elemental Hero Ocean " in his  hand  to  Fusion Summon  " Elemental Hero Absolute Zero " (2500/2000) from his hand in  Attack Position . He then activates " Element Conversion ", making the  Attribute  of all  monsters  on the field  WATER  for the duration of the  turn . The  ATK  of "Absolute Zero" increases by 500 for each other WATER monster on the field ("Elemental Hero Absolute Zero": 2500 → 3500/2000). Jaden  attacks  and  destroys  " Dark End Dragon " with "Absolute Zero". As his  Level  8 "Dark End Dragon" was destroyed, Chazz activates his  face-down  " Dragon's Lair ",  Special Summoning  the also Level 8 " Light End Dragon " (2600/2100) from his hand in Attack Position. Jaden Sets a card. On the End Phase, the effect of "Element Conversion" expires ("Absolute Zero": 3500 → 2500/2000).

He then activates the  effect  of "Light End Dragon", decreasing its ATK and  DEF  by 500 ("Light End Dragon": 2600 → 2100/2100 → 1600) to decrease the ATK and DEF of "Absolute Zero" by 1500 ("Absolute Zero": 2500 → 1000/2000 → 500).

Chazz Sets a card.
