      The Muscle Hunters.     
 The  Muscle Hunters  (マッスルハンター  Massuru Hantā ), known as  Venoms  in the English  Yu-Gi-Oh! Dungeon Dice Monsters  video game, are a group of thugs in the  Yu-Gi-Oh!  manga . They were hired by the  Junky Scorpion owner  to steal back expensive sports shoes he sells, including  Air Muscle . [1] 
 They are based on the real life phenomenon, "Air Max Hunting", a wave of thefts in Japan in the mid 1990s, in which highly sought and trendy Nike Air Max shoes were reportedly mugged and stolen from their owners. [2] 
 
 Appearances 
 They once attacked  Katsuya Jonouchi ,  Hiroto Honda  and  Yugi Mutou  from behind and stole Jonouchi's Air Muscle shoes. Jonouchi and Honda tracked them down later at the arcade and beat them while fighting face to face. The Muscle Hunters then revealed that they'd been paid by the store owner. [1]
