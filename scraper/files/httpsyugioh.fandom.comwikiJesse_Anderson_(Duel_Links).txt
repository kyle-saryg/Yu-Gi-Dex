 Trivia 
 Interestingly, whenever Jesse Summons any of the Crystal Beasts, a cut-in frame of his face always appears. 
 Oddly enough, Jesse has dialogue for both " Malefic Rainbow Dragon ", which was stolen by  Paradox , and the cards that were used when Jesse was possessed by  Yubel : " Advanced Dark ", " Grave Squirmer ", " Grinder Golem ", " Hand Destruction ", " Phantom Skyblaster ", and " Rainbow Dark Dragon ".
 Interestingly, Jesse tells Yubel that she will never take over his body again, reference the  Dimension World  arc of the  Yu-Gi-Oh! GX  anime. 
 When Jesse loses a Duel against  Jaden Yuki  or  Jaden/Yubel , he says "Your HEROES are awesome! Can I get their autograph?" 
 Yugi Muto (DM) ,  Bandit Keith ,  The Paradox Brothers ,  Seto Kaiba (DSOD) ,  Yugi Muto (DSOD) ,  Joey Wheeler (DSOD) , Jaden Yuki, Jesse Anderson,  Alexis Rhodes ,  Yubel ,  Syrus Truesdale , Jaden/Yubel,  Yusei Fudo ,  Luna ,  Antinomy ,  Carly Carmine , and  Yuma and Astral  are the characters with the most cards that feature a cut-in frame of their face(s). 
 Yugi Muto (DM),  Espa Roba , Seto Kaiba (DSOD),  Aigami , Jesse Anderson,  Chazz Princeton , Jaden/Yubel, Yusei Fudo,  Jack Atlas ,  Crow Hogan ,  Akiza Izinski ,  Leo , Luna,  Tetsu Trudge ,  Dark Signer Kalin Kessler , Antinomy,  Kalin Kessler , Yuma and Astral,  Reginald Kastle ,  Bronk Stone ,  Tori Meadows , and  Kite Tenjo  are the characters who possess a  Skill  that allows them to begin a Duel with copies of specific Monster Cards added to their Main Deck and/or Extra Deck. 
 Lumis and Umbra , Seto Kaiba (DSOD),  Mokuba Kaiba (DSOD) , Yugi Muto (DSOD), Joey Wheeler (DSOD),  Téa Gardner (DSOD) ,  Scud , Jesse Anderson, Yusei Fudo, Jack Atlas, Crow Hogan, Akiza Izinski, Leo, Luna, Tetsu Trudge, Dark Signer Kalin Kessler,  Dark Signer Carly Carmine , Kalin Kessler, and Carly Carmine have additional character-specific dialogue that is generic, due to having the same dialogue when Dueling against certain Legendary Duelists. 
 Jaden Yuki, Jaden/Yubel, Jesse Anderson, Yusei Fudo, and Tetsu Trudge are the characters that have character-specific dialogue for Legendary Duelists outside of their respective  Yu-Gi-Oh!  series'. 
 The Paradox Brothers,  Arkana , Lumis and Umbra, Aigami,  Sera ,  Prana , Jesse Anderson, Alexis Rhodes,  Dr. Vellian Crowler ,  Bastion Misawa ,  Tyranno Hassleberry ,  Sartorius Kumar ,  Blair Flannigan , Yusei Fudo, Dark Signer Kalin Kessler, Kalin Kessler, and Reginald Kastle are the Legendary Duelists who have dialogue for cards that are non-existent, unreleased, anime-exclusive, or video game-exclusive. It is uncertain as to why these cards were found in the voice files, or if these said cards will be released in the future.
 Jesse's dialogue for such cards include: " Amber Crystal Circle ", " Crystal Flash ", " Crystal Fortress ", " E Force ", " G Force ", " GEM Burst ", " Golden Rule ", " M Force ", " Rainbow Blessing ", " Take Flight ", and " The One to be Protected ". 
 While Legendary Duelists have their own theme music when a player Duels against them, some share the same theme music:
 Joey Wheeler (DM) ,  Mai Valentine , and  Tristan Taylor (DM) 
 Téa Gardner (DM)  and Yugi Muto (DM)
