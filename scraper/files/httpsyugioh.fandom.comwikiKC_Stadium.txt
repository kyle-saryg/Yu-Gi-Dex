 Kaiba had his staff at  KaibaCorp  organize an event to exhibit the new Duel Disk model.  Isono  later confirmed that it would be a Dueling competition at Kaiba Land. [2] 
 While reconstructing the  Millennium Puzzle , Kaiba discovered two pieces were missing. The suspected holders,  Aigami  and  Yugi Mutou  were abducted and instructed to go to the stadium, respectively to take part in the exhibition. [2] 
 The stadium was packed on the day of the exhibition. Among those in attendance were  Katsuya Jonouchi ,  Anzu Mazaki ,  Hiroto Honda ,  Insector Haga  and  Dinosaur Ryuzaki . The exhibition opened with an air show, with the audience initially uninformed that the jets were  Solid Vision  projections. One of the jets appeared to be crash landing, only to be destroyed by a solid vision " Neo Blue-Eyes Ultimate Dragon ". [2] 
 Kaiba intended to Duel both Aigami and Yugi at the stadium to acquire the Millennium Puzzle pieces. However Yugi insisted on Dueling Aigami. Yugi defeated Aigami and his Duel with Kaiba was interrupted by the appearance of  Dark Diva , whom Yugi and Kaiba Dueled together. [2]
