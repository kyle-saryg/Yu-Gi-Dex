 Summary 
 Having defeated  Syrus Truesdale  with " The Big Saturn ",  David Rabb  explains that "Saturn" is one of the  Legendary Planets , and that card is one-of-a-kind. Syrus recognizes it was being from the same series as  Jaden Yuki 's " Elemental Hero Terra Firma ". David is disappointed in Syrus' strength, and even speculates that if this is how strong  Zane 's brother is, then Zane himself may not be that strong. Noticing that he had been watching nearby, he calls Zane out, asking if he was spying on his competition or keeping an eye on his younger brother. He challenges Zane to a duel there and now, rather than waiting. Syrus intervenes, saying David can say what he wants about him, but that he won't let him insult his brother. He also vows not to let the duel take place, as the only person with that right will be the winner of the tournament. David departs, and Syrus tells Zane that he'll meet him once he wins the tournament, with Zane thinking that Syrus has done a lot of growing up while Zane's been abroad.
 Bastion Misawa  and  Chazz Princeton  have begun their duel. Both have 4000  Life Points , and Bastion has " Crow Tengu " in  Defense Position , while Chazz has " Tusk Dragon " in  Attack Position . Chazz  Summons  " Dragon-Mail Knight ", who attacks and  destroys  "Crow Tengu". He then attacks  directly  with "Tusk Dragon", reducing Bastion to 2200 Life Points. Chazz  Sets  a card to end his turn, with Bastion speculating that it must be a  Dragon  support card. Bastion tells Chazz that he'll give him a taste of his  Yokai  monsters, and Summons " Shutendoji " in Attack Position before Setting a card. Chazz is worried about Bastion's two  face-down  cards, but remembers those students who taunted him, believeing him to have only gotten into  Obelisk Blue  via his family's money.
