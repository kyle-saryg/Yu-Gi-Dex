 Synopsis 
 Yusei  and  Akiza  comment on the players and their usage of  Synchro Monsters . They also break the fourth wall by not only referring to their futuristic setting of  Neo Domino City  but  card games on motorcycles . Akiza challenges Yusei to a duel, and Yusei offers to play in a  Turbo Duel . Akiza declines in favor for a regular duel, citing the city's speed limits.
 Yusei, the challenged, begins the duel. With his usage of  Traps  and  monster   effects , he gains a large  card advantage  and quickly  Synchro Summons  " Junk Warrior ". With its "Power of Fellows" effect and after summoning " Armory Arm ", "Junk Warrior" has 4400 ATK. Akiza loses a nearly fatal amount of  Life Points , but she taunts Yusei by attracting the live audience's support. To counter, Akiza destroys all of Yusei's cards by quickly summoning her  Signer Dragon , " Black Rose Dragon ".
 Both duelists lobby back and forth, not summoning any monsters as they build up their back row. Yusei takes the opportunity for an offensive front and summons " Stardust Dragon ". Akiza blocks this attack by reviving "Black Rose Dragon." Akiza then seizes  control  of "Stardust Dragon" with " Mark of the Rose ". Yusei attempts to stall with monster effects and by summoning " Junk Destroyer ", whose  Level  Akiza drops drastically with " Star Siphon ". Akiza then continues to increase the ATK of "Black Rose Dragon" to 4000. By stalling, Yusei builds up the resources needed to summon " Shooting Quasar Dragon " in order to destroy "Black Rose Dragon". The effect of "Shooting Quasar Dragon" allows Yusei to summon " Shooting Star Dragon ", winning him the duel.
