The  Coliseum , in  Yu-Gi-Oh! BAM , is a feature added to the game on its first anniversary on Kongregate, April 18, 2014. 
 This allows the player to do a  Booster Battle  using cards from 2  Live Duels   Booster Packs  against a random player in a Live Duel. The player who wins gets 1 random card from the Live Duels Booster Pack. The one who loses doesn't get anything. It costs   2.
 
 Live Duel Rules 
 Neither player can use friend help and  Power-Ups . 
 Each player have 1 free shuffle. 
 Each player has a time limit to put cards on the field. If the time ends, it will be as if the BAM button was pressed, and the Round starts automatically. 
 At the start of the Duel, 1 random player will have the priority over the other player. When both players have an effect that have the same priority, the player with the priority will activate their effect first. The priority changes to the other player at the end of each Round.
