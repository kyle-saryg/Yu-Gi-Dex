 Yu-Gi-Oh! VRAINS 
 In  episode 2 , a  Knight of Hanoi  uses this card during his  Speed Duel  against  Playmaker . He equips this card onto his " Cracking Dragon ". However, "Cracking Dragon" fails to destroy a monster by battle due to Playmaker activating " Three Strikes Barrier " to protect his monster, so this card's effect does not apply. On Playmaker's next turn, this card is destroyed when his " Decode Talker " attacks and destroys "Cracking Dragon".
