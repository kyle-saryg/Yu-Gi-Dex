 OCG Rulings 
 If " Necrovalley " is not face-up on the field, when this card's effect is activated, the selected  Field Spell Card  is placed on the top of the Deck. [1] 
 If " Necrovalley " is face-up on the field, when this card's effect is activated, it is optional to choose if the selected  Field Spell Card  will be placed on the top of the  Deck , or in the hand. [1] 
 You must show the selected  Field Spell Card  to your opponent to verify. [1] 
 Previously Official Rulings 
   These TCG rulings were issued by  Upper Deck Entertainment  and have since been deemed unofficial by Konami. [2]  They were previously considered official and can still be correct, as long as they follow the official gameplay rules, or unless Konami has issued a ruling that says otherwise. References:  [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] 
 
 Show the card to your opponent. 
 If " Imperial Order " & " Necrovalley " are both active, and " An Owl of Luck " is flipped, you add the card to your hand because " Necrovalley " is  face-up  on the field, even though its effect is negated. 
 If " Mystical Space Typhoon " is chained to the effect to destroy " Necrovalley ", so that " Necrovalley " is not on the field when this effect  resolves , you cannot place the card in your  hand . 
 You  select  the card for this effect when the effect  resolves , not when it activates.
