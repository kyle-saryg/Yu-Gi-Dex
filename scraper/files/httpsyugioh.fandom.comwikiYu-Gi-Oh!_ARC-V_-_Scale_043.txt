 Yuya  activates " Pendulum Match ", which allows him to randomly  Special Summon  a  Pendulum Monster  from his  Extra Deck , and  Reiji  can Special Summon a Pendulum Monster with the same  Pendulum Scale  as Yuya's monster from his  Deck , but at the end of the  Battle Phase , any remaining monsters summoned by this effect are destroyed. Yuya Special Summons the Pendulum Scale 4 " Clearwing Fast Dragon ", while Reiji Special Summons " D/D/D Supersight King Zero Maxwell " (2800/2500). Yuya activates the effect of "Clearwing Fast Dragon", making the ATK of Reiji's monster zero, and negates its effects ("D/D/D Supersight King Zero Maxwell": 2500 → 0 ATK).
