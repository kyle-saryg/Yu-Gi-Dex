      The village.     
 The  village  was a location in the  Monster World  tabletop role-playing game that  Dark Bakura  set up. [1] 
 
 Characteristics 
       The interior of the village.     
 Since the village was just an object on a game board, it could be lifted out, exposing another section of the board underneath. This section contained the interior of some buildings in the village, including a bar and a restaurant. [1] 
 
 Events 
 Yugi ,  Jonouchi ,  Anzu  and  Honda  (and  Miho  in the anime) went to village at the start of their game of  Monster World  with Dark Bakura. They spoke to the  barman  to get information. He told them how  Zorc  had been terrorizing the land and instructed them to get directions from " Villager D ". [1]
