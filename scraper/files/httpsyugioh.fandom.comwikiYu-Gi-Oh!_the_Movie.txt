 Trivia 
 This movie is said to take place sometime after episode 3, but before the Death-T arc (starting in episode 21), as Kaiba only recalls his previous draw with Yugi. 
 This marks the end of the Toei anime and the last appearance of  Miho Nosaka . 
 Character appearances appear closer to their manga counterparts than they did during the Toei series. Most notably,  Seto Kaiba 's general appearance is now very similar to his manga counterpart, his green hair and gold/light brown eyes being replaced with brown hair and light blue eyes; and  Yugi Mutou / Dark Yugi's  hair appears much stiffer and straighter. Also,  Dinosaur Ryuzaki  makes an appearance as a contestant dueling against Kaiba, but only for a brief moment while leaving the tournament due to a loss but doesn't speak. 
 The card game is now referred to as  Duel Monsters  (as it is in the NAS series) and the cards' backs take on a similar appearance to their manga counterparts. 
 Anzu has a job now despite the school laws as established in episode 2. 
 The duel system Kaiba and Yugi use during their duel made its debut during the Duelist Kingdom story arc. The duel itself resembles the duel here in both monsters summoned and specific strategies. Blue-Eyes being summoned to destroy Gaia is identical to a turn in the duel of  1  of the NAS series and even has the same appearance from behind Yugi as it's being destroyed. The round with the Magical Hats is the same as in the duel of Episodes  9  and  10  of the NAS series. 
 During the final turn of the duel between Yugi and Kaiba, after Yugi fuses "Meteor Dragon" with "Red Eyes B. Dragon" to form "Meteor B. Dragon" (3500/2000), Yugi somehow causes Kaiba's "Blue-Eyes White Dragon's 3-Body Connection" (4500/3000) to separate (how this happened is not explained) allowing Yugi to focus his attack on one "Blue-Eyes White Dragon" (3000/2500) which is weaker than "Meteor B. Dragon", allowing Yugi to not only destroy Kaiba's monster but cause enough Life Point damage to win him the duel. If Yugi used "Meteor B. Dragon" to attack "Blue-Eyes White Dragon's 3-Body Connection" directly, it would not have enough attack points to destroy it and instead cause Yugi to lose the duel. 
 This is the only Yu-Gi-Oh! anime to not be digitally animated.
