 Turn 5: Jack 
 Jack  Sets a card. Jack  Normal Summons  " Red Resonator " (600/200). As a " Red "  monster  was Normal Summoned, Jack  Special Summons  " Red Warg " from his  hand  in  Attack Position  via its own  effect , but its  ATK  is halved and Jack will be unable to  attack  this  turn  ("Red Warg" 1400 → 700). He  tunes  the  Level  6 "Red Warg" with the Level 2  Tuner monster  "Red Resonator" to  Synchro Summon  the Level 8 " Scarlight Red Dragon Archfiend " (3000/2500) in Attack Position. Jack activates the effect of "Scarlight",  destroying  all other Special Summoned monsters on the  field  with ATK equal to or less than that of "Scarlight" and inflicting 500  damage  for each card. The Battle Beast activates his  face-down   Continuous Trap Card , " Gladiator Beast's Medusa Shield ", which prevents a " Gladiator Beast " monster from being destroyed by card effects. He targets " Gladiator Beast Gyzarus ". Jack activates his face-down " Red Vanish ", which can be activated the turn it is Set if he controls a "Red" monster.

Sanders activates the effect of "Tamer Editor", allowing him to Special Summon a "Gladiator Beast" Fusion Monster from any  Extra Deck  to its  owner 's field, ignoring its Summoning conditions. He Special Summons the Battle Beast's " Gladiator Beast Andabata " (1000/2400) from his  Extra Deck  to his side of the field in Attack Position. Since there are two or more face-up "Gladiator Beast" monsters on the field, Sanders activates the effect of "Tamer Editor", allowing the controller of those monsters to destroy a monster on the field and inflict damage to its controller equal to its ATK. Sanders targets "Scarlight". As a "Red" monster is being targeted by a card effect, Jack activates his face-down " Red Armor ", preventing "Red" monsters from being destroyed by card effects this turn.

Yuya Special Summons " Performapal Gongato " (100/100) in  Defense Position  ("Andabatae": 1000 → 100). "Pararhino" attacks "Andabata", but " Gladiator Beast's Medallion " prevents "Andabata" from being destroyed, but doubles the  battle damage  the Battle Beast takes (BB 1100 → 300). As the Battle Beast took battle damage involving a "Gladiator Beast" monster he controls, he activates his face-down Continuous Trap Card " Gladiator Beast's Assault Fort ", destroying all non-"Gladiator Beast" cards he controls, making all other "Gladiator Beast" Spell/Trap Cards he controls " Gladiator Beast Fort ", and placing a "Gladiator Beast" monster from his Deck underneath each "Fort". "Thumbs Down" is destroyed, "Medallion" and " Gladiator Beast's Valor " become "Gladiator Beast Forts" and the Battle Beast places " Gladiator Beast Augustus " and " Gladiator Beast Laquari " underneath them. He can return those cards to the Deck to inflict 1000 damage. During both players' turns, he may also prevent a "Gladiator Beast" monster from being destroyed by card effect or  battle .
 Turn 8: Battle Beast 
As there are two or more "Gladiator Beast" monsters on the field, the effect of "Tamer Editor" lets those monsters' controller destroy a monster on the field and inflict damage to its controller equal to its ATK. The Battle Beast targets "Tamer Editor" itself.
