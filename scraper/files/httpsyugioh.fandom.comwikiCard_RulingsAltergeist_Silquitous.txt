 OCG Rulings 
 When activating the effect of " Altergeist Silquitous ", you must return a face-up “Altergeist” card on your field, to your hand. Since "Altergeist" Link monster cannot be returned to your hand, so it cannot be used for the cost of " Altergeist Silquitous ". 
 When activating the effect of " Altergeist Silquitous " that returns an opponent’s card to the hand, you can also target a Token. (It does not return to the hand, but disappears instead.)
