 LADIES AND GENTLEMEN 
Let’s start, shall we? (Come on!) 
Thank you for waiting, 
Don’t miss it! 
Start a countdown, 3, 2, 1! 
Step forward and draw! 
There’s a feeling something’s about to happen 
A synchro to my soul, throbbing in my burning heart 
I want to jolt my current limits 
Scattered upon this world’s field 
Draw out your numerous possibilities, fight it out! 
My feelings are speeding like a jet coaster 
Dashing about with a ba-bang! Entermate! 
Linked across space and time, the goals I share with my comrades 
Can’t deal with it the easy way? No! Don’t give up 
I will go x4 
Up to greater heights! (Fly so high!) 
Will we make it, or will it end here? 
Nobody knows 
Even in a desperate turn, turn the tide over with a loud bang! 
One day I want to arrive at the ultimate image 
Just smile, just smile 
Full throttle into the ARC of smiles! 
My pride never changes! 
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, don’t miss it! 
Step forward and draw!
