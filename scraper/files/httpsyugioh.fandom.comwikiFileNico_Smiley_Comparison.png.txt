 Yu-Gi-Oh! ARC-V  (read as " Arc Five ") is a  Yu-Gi-Oh !  anime series, the fourth main spin-off series, which began airing in Japan on April 6, 2014, following the end of  Yu-Gi-Oh! ZEXAL . The series focuses on  Yuya Sakaki . As with the previous spin-offs, it focuses on (and introduces) a new type of Summoning - this time,  Pendulum Summoning , as well as  Pendulum Monsters  and the mechanic in general. There is also a  manga adaptation . It was followed by  Yu-Gi-Oh! VRAINS  on May 10, 2017. 
 This series is best known for being the only  Yu-Gi-Oh !  series to show all unique types of Summoning from the  Yu-Gi-Oh! Trading Card Game  (though at the time, both  Yu-Gi-Oh!  and  Yu-Gi-Oh! GX  showed the available Summoning types):  Fusion Summoning  (from  Yu-Gi-Oh!  and  Yu-Gi-Oh! GX ),  Ritual Summoning  (from  Yu-Gi-Oh!  and  Yu-Gi-Oh! GX ),  Synchro Summoning  (from  Yu-Gi-Oh! 5D's ),  Xyz Summoning  (from  Yu-Gi-Oh! ZEXAL ), and the newly introduced Pendulum Summon.
 It has a slightly different story structure than any Yu-Gi-Oh! series that came before it. Rather than having a handful of characters to remain the focus throughout the entire show, only  Yuya Sakaki  maintains permanent "main character" status; there are many other major characters with only a handful being in the spotlight at any given moment.
 As of May 5, 2018, all episodes of Yu-Gi-Oh! ARC-V (148 total) have been dubbed into English.

 Story 
           The Japanese  ARC-V  logo.     
 Yu-Gi-Oh! ARC-V  centers around  Yuya Sakaki , as he tries to escape from harsh reality by smiling. But one  Duel  leads him to make a determination to confront the difficulties and he will get the power of infinite possibilities. The show's main theme is "Take a step forward with courage!!"
 Yuya is a student at a preparatory school, learning to become an "entertainment Duelist", a type of professional Duelist. [3] [4] 
 The story is set in  Paradise City  on the coast of Japan.  Leo Corporation  is run by its president  Declan Akaba . Thanks to the spread of the company's " Solid Vision  with mass," " Action Duels " are born in Paradise City and has reached worldwide popularity. Children look up to star-level Pro Duelists, and they learn Summoning and Duel styles at various large and small cram schools, including the  You Show Duel School  that Yuya attends and the largest of such schools,  Leo Institute of Dueling  (LID). [1] 
 One day, Yuya ends up fighting an exhibition match with the current champion of Pro Duel world… [1] 
 During the Duel,  Yuya's pendant  begins to glow, giving him access to a never-before-seen type of Summoning called  Pendulum Summoning . This causes the  Leo Corporation  to take an interest in Yuya. Meanwhile, a  dark Duelist  is trying to take down the Leo Corporation, and he looks exactly like Yuya!
 In order to become a pro and follow in his father's footsteps, Yuya must win four matches in a row to qualify for the  Arc League Championship . During this challenge, Yuya grows as a Duelist and eventually gains entry into the tournament. As the tournament is about to begin, Declan wonders whether Yuya has the strength to protect the  Standard Dimension  from his father,  Leo Akaba .
 The Paradise City Championship is underway, and Yuya's first match is against his rival:  Sylvio . When they last met, Sylvio promised that he would master Pendulum Summoning before their next Duel and defeat Yuya. Meanwhile,  Sora 's opponent is none other than  Shay , a highly dangerous Duelist from another dimension who has entered the tournament at Declan's request.
 Ultimately, Yuya and his friends have found themselves in an ever-growing mystery surrounding the major Dueling schools in the city... and beyond. [5] [6]

 Differences in adaptations 
 General edits 
 General edits involve changes to dialogue, names and scoring.
 
 Some names are Americanized.
 The names of terms returning from previous series' are changed to be the same as in previous dubs, while in the Japanese they are often different (for example, Public Security Bureau and Neo Domino City became Security and the City in the Japanese between  Yu-Gi-Oh! 5D's  and  ARC-V , while they are Sector Security and New Domino City in both  5D's  and  ARC-V  in the dub). 
 All of the music in the dub is rescored. 
 The  Pendulum Zone  activation and point gauge sound effects are replaced with different ones than the originals. 
 Dialogue is added in some scenes to remove silence. 
 Frederick 's shivers are changed to various terms; in later episodes a common term is "goosepickle". 
 Chojiro Tokumatsu 's mantra of "Enjoy Dueling" is changed to "Be a Hero". 
 The flashbacks of  Heartland's invasion  are tinged purple. 
 Paint edits 
 Paint edits involve changes to the footage. General edits that involves digital paint goes under this category.
 
           An example of a paint edit in Yu-Gi-Oh! ARC-V, where  Nico Smiley 's moustache is edited. Left is the Japanese version and right is the dubbed version.     
 Nico Smiley 's mustache was lengthened to avoid resemblance to Adolf Hitler. 
 The "LDS" (Leo Duel School) sign is changed to "LID" (Leo Institute of Dueling). This is possibly to avoid confusion with the Mormons. 
 The Duelist's names in the beginning of all Duels are removed and the LP counter is enlarged. 
 Skirts and socks on female characters are lengthened to avoid any sexual implications. 
 Most of the Japanese text is digitally painted out. 
 When a Duelist is holding a card(s) in a way that it appears like they're flipping the bird, their hand is redrawn. A common example of this is when a Duelist is about to place a  Pendulum Monster (s) in their Pendulum Zone(s) while holding Pendulum Monster(s). 
 In advertisements, every card shown is digitally painted out. 
 Some monsters are edited to correspond with their  TCG  artworks. 
 Deleted scenes 
 Deleted scenes involve cutting footage.
 
 The explanation of  Action Duels  before the beginning of an opening is cut. 
 Some close up shots showing lots of text are cut. An example is a close up shot of a Poster with text or a close up shot of the contents of a book. 
 Some scenes that are too violent to be shown are cut, edited or shortened. 
 The scenes of the implements of the " Frightfur " monsters bursting from their bodies were initially cut from the dub, but were later left in. 
 Trivia 
 This is the first series to have more episodes (148) than its  predecessor  (146). 
 This is the last series to:
 Have a full televised run in the  Heisei period . 
 Reuse sound effects from  Yu-Gi-Oh! 5Ds , as the  succeeding series  has its own original sound effects. 
 Logically, the Standard Dimension should have characters from the original  Yu-Gi-Oh!  series (like Joey Wheeler or Mai Valentine; non-protagonist duelists) but it does not. Doubling the irony, Aster Phoenix, Jack Atlas and Kite Tenjo are rivals to the main character of their respective series, but Seto Kaiba (who held the role first) does not appear. 
 The plot bears similarity to the DC comics event  Crisis on Infinite Earths .
 Due to the blunder of one man's plan, multiple worlds are put at risk.
 Leo Akaba's monomania in trying to revive Ray ended up causing Zarc's fragments to encounter and absorb each other, reviving the greatest threat to reality. 
 A group of heroes is put together to fight back.
 Declan creates the Lancers. 
 When the universes are restored to normal, the prime universe initially lacks any memory of the previous version of its reality.
 The Standard Dimension is reborn the Pendulum Dimension, with initially all memory of Zuzu being missing. 
 Z-ARC and Ray's dimensional counterparts combining into one person seems to have inspired the 2019-2020 live action version, where one character is combined with all of his doppelgängers. 
 Each of the  Four Dimensions  evokes a plot point from a previous series to which it's related to.
 Standard Dimension - Yu-Gi-Oh! :  Yugi Muto  like  Yuya Sakaki  enjoy dueling for fun, while  Seto Kaiba  and  Declan Akaba  are serious and focus on pure strength. Also Declan Akaba took over his father's company, similar to Kaiba. 
 Fusion Dimension - Yu-Gi-Oh! GX :  Yubel  tries to fuse the twelve dimensions using  Super Polymerization , similar to  Leo Akaba  and the  Arc Project . 
 Synchro Dimension - Yu-Gi-Oh! 5D's : Both have  Turbo Dueling  and the caste system is a major plot point with the main cast being arrested and having to escape, similar to  Yusei Fudo . 
 Xyz Dimension - Yu-Gi-Oh! ZEXAL : Both have major plot points involving outside invaders,  Duel Academy  and  Barian World  respectively. 
 It is the Last Series to be Dubbed to Filipino.
