 Notes 
 When  Joey  attacks  Zigfried 's " Valkyrie Erste " with his " Red-Eyes Black Dragon " (second-to-last turn of the episode), the English Dub is poorly translated.
 In the Dub, Joey says " Fine. Alright Red-Eyes, you get rid of her! With Inferno Fire Blast ", clearly referring to " Valkyrie Brunhilde " (which had been previously attacked by Joey's " Maximum Six ", but had avoided destruction thanks to its special effect). 
 In the original Japanese, the attack target is correctly referred to as "the other Valkyrie" (i.e. Erste). 
 The screen displaying the Duel results in the Japanese version reads 'Jyounouchi' instead of 'Jounouchi'.

 This episode marks the conclusion of Joey's last Duel of the series. 
 Featured Duel: Joey Wheeler vs. Zigfried Lloyd 
 Duel continues from previous episode. 
 Joey has 4000 Life Points remaining and controls " Jinzo " (2400/1500) in Attack Position and one set card.
 Zigfried has 1600 Life Points remaining and controls " Ride of The Valkyries ".
 Turn 6: Zigfried  
Zigfried has just activated "Ride of The Valkyries" to Special Summon three " Valkyrie Zweite " (1600/1600) and one " Valkyrie Erste " (1600/1800) in Attack Position. Since the first "Valkyrie Zweite" was summoned, its effect activates, destroying Joey's " Jinzo ". Zigfried then activates the effect of "Valkyrie Erste", removing the "Jinzo" in Joey's  Graveyard  from play and changing the ATK of "Valkyrie Erste" to the ATK of "Jinzo" until the End Phase ("Valkyrie Erste": 1600 → 2400/1800). 
 The three "Valkyrie Zweite" and "Valkyrie Erste" attack directly, but Joey activates his face-down " Hyper Refresh " to double his Life Points before  damage calculation  since the combined ATK of all Attack Position monsters Zigfried controls is higher than his Life Points ( Joey  4000 → 8000). The attacks continue ( Joey  8000 → 5600 → 4000 → 2400 → 800). Zigfried then Sets a card. On Zigfried's End Phase, all  Valkyrie  monsters that Zigfried summoned via "Ride of the Valkyries" return to his  Deck .
 Turn 7: Joey 
Joey draws. He then Normal Summons " Swordsman of Landstar " (500/1200) in Attack Position. "Swordsman of Landstar" attacks directly, but Zigfried activates his face-down " Fricka's Mediation " to remove the " Wotan's Judgment " in his Graveyard from play and reduce the Battle Damage he takes this turn to 0. Joey then Sets a card (" Graceful Dice ").
 Turn 8: Zigfried  
Zigfried draws " Nibelung's Treasure " and subsequently activates it to activate " Nibelung's Ring " from his  Deck  to Joey's side of the field, equipping "Nibelung's Ring" onto Joey's "Swordsman of Landstar". Now the equipped monster can't attack, be  Tributed , change its  battle position  or activate any effects it has. Also, Joey will draw two cards during each of his Draw Phases instead of conducting a normal Draw during his Draw Phase. If Joey has drawn any monsters through the effect of "Nibelung's Ring", then he must discard one of the drawn monsters. Due to the secondary effect of "Nibelung's Treasure", Zigfried draws five cards. 
 Zigfried then activates " Goddess Urd's Verdict ", " Goddess Verdande's Guidance ", and " Goddess Skuld's Oracle ". Now once a turn, Zigfried can use "Goddess Skuld's Oracle" to look at the top three cards of Joey's Deck and rearrange them to however he wishes. Also once a turn, Zigfried can use "Goddess Verdande's Guidance" to guess the card type of the top card of Joey's Deck. If he is correct, Joey must set the top card of his Deck face-down on his side of the field. In addition, Zigfried can use the effect of "Goddess Urd's Verdict" once a turn to select one of Joey's set cards and guess what that card is. If he is correct, then the set card will be removed from play.
 Zigfried then activates the effect of "Goddess Skuld's Oracle" to look at the top three cards of Joey's Deck (" Knight of Dark Dragon ", " Panther Warrior " and " Dangerous Machine Type-6 "). Zigfried tells Joey to place "Panther Warrior" on top and he does so. Zigfried then activates the effect of "Goddess Verdande's Guidance" and guesses that Joey's top card is a  Monster Card . He is correct, so Joey  Special Summons  "Panther Warrior" in face-down  Defense Position . Zigfried then activates the effect of "Goddess Urd's Verdict" to target Joey's face-down card and guess that the card is "Panther Warrior". He is correct, so "Panther Warrior" is removed from play.
 Turn 9: Joey  
Due to the effect of "Nibelung's Ring", Joey draws two cards ("Knight of Dark Dragon" and "Dangerous Machine Type-6") instead of conducting a normal draw. He discards "Knight of Dark Dragon". Joey then activates "Dangerous Machine Type-6". Now during each of Joey's Standby Phases, Joey can roll a die and then he can activate an appropriate effect of "Dangerous Machine Type-6", depending on the result.
 Turn 10: Zigfried  
Zigfried draws. He then activates the effect of "Goddess Skuld's Oracle" to look at the top three cards of Joey's deck (" Grappler of Landstar ", " Goblin Attack Force ", and "Sasuke Samurai"). Zigfried tells Joey to place "Goblin Attack Force" on top and he does so. Zigfried then activates the effect of "Goddess Verdande's Guidance" and guesses Joey's top card is a " Monster Card ". He is correct, so Joey  Special Summons  "Goblin Attack Force" in face-down  Defense Position . Zigfried then activates the effect of "Goddess Urd's Verdict" to target Joey's face-down card and guess that the set card is "Goblin Attack Force". He is correct, so "Goblin Attack Force" is removed from play. Zigfried then Sets a card.
 Turn 11: Joey  
Due to the effect of "Nibelung's Ring", Joey draws two cards ("Grappler of Landstar" and "Sasuke Samurai") instead of conducting a normal draw. Joey discards "Grappler of Landstar". On Joey's Standby Phase, he activates the effect of "Dangerous Machine Type-6" to roll a die. Joey gets a 3, so he draws a card. Joey then Normal Summons " Sasuke Samurai " (500/800) in  Attack Position . Zigfried then activates his face-down " Loge's Flame ". Now any monsters with 2000  ATK  or less can't attack. 
 Joey then activates his face-down "Graceful Dice" to roll a die and multiply the ATK of "Sasuke Samurai" by the die result. Joey gets a three ("Sasuke Samurai": 500 → 1500/800). Joey then sets a card (" Silver Dollar "). On Joey's End Phase, the effect of "Graceful Dice" expires ("Sasuke Samurai": 1500 → 500/800).
 Turn 12: Zigfried  
Zigfried draws. He then activates the effect of "Goddess Skuld's Oracle" to look at the top three cards of Joey's deck (" Blue Flame Swordsman ", " Gearfried the Iron Knight ", and " Release Restraint ").  Zigfried tells Joey to place "Gearfried the Iron Knight" on top and he does so. Zigfried then activates the effect of "Goddess Verdande's Guidance" and guesses that Joey's top card is a " Monster Card ". He is correct, so Joey  Special Summons  "Gearfried the Iron Knight" in face-down  Defense Position . Zigfried then activates the effect of "Goddess Urd's Verdict" to target Joey's face-down card and guess that the set card is "Gearfried the Iron Knight". He is correct, so "Gearfried the Iron Knight" is removed from play. 
 Zigfried then activates " Swan Maiden " to  Special Summon  "Valkyrie Erste" (1600/1800) from his hand in Attack Position. "Valkyrie Erste" attacks Joey's "Sasuke Samurai", but Joey activates his face-down "Silver Dollar" to reduce the Battle Damage he would take to 0 and prevent his monster from being destroyed. Zigfried then Sets a card.
 Turn 13: Joey  
Due to the effect of "Nibelung's Ring", Joey draws two cards ("Release Restraint" and "Blue Flame Swordsman") instead of conducting a normal draw. Joey discards "Blue Flame Swordsman". On Joey's Standby Phase, he activates the effect of "Dangerous Machine Type-6" to roll a die. Joey gets a 3, so he draws a card (" Roll of Fate "). Joey then activates "Roll of Fate" to roll a die. Depending on the result, Joey can draw cards equal to the die result and then send the same number of cards from the top of his Deck to the Graveyard. Joey gets a 6, so he draws six cards and sends the top six cards from his  Deck  to his  Graveyard . 
 Joey then activates " Giant Trunade " to return all  Spell  and  Trap Cards  on the field to their owners' hands; "Dangerous Machine Type-6" returns to Joey's hand while "Nibelung's Ring", "Goddess Urd's Verdict", "Goddess Verdande's Guidance", "Goddess Skuld's Oracle", and Zigfried's set card are returned to Zigfried's hand. Zigfried's set card is revealed to be " Apple of Enlightenment ". Since the latter was removed from the field, its effect activates, allowing Zigfried to draw a card. 
 Since Zigfried's "Loge's Flame" was removed from the field, its second effect activates, allowing Zigfried to  Special Summon  " Valkyrie Brunhilde " (1800/2000) in  Attack Position . Due to the effect of "Valkyrie Brunhilde", it gains 300  ATK  for every  Dragon  and  Warrior - Type  monster on the field. Joey currently controls two Wariror-type monsters ("Valkyrie Brunhilde": 1800 → 2400/2000). 
 Joey then Tributes "Swordsman of Landstar" in order to Tribute Summon " Maximum Six " (1900/1600) in Attack Position. Since "Maximum Six" was Tribute Summoned, its effect activates, allowing Joey to roll a die and increase the ATK of "Maximum Six" by the die result times 200. Joey gets a 6 ("Maximum Six": 1900 → 3100/1600). 
 Joey then activates " Star Blaster " to target "Sasuke Samurai" and roll a die. The die result will be added to the Level of "Sasuke Samurai" and after that happens Joey can Tribute "Sasuke Samurai" to summon a monster from his hand whose Level is the same as the Level of "Sasuke Samurai". Joey gets a 5 ("Sasuke Samurai": Level 2 → 7). Joey then Tributes "Sasuke Samurai" in order to  Special Summon  " Red-Eyes Black Dragon " (2400/2000) in  Attack Position . 
 "Maximum Six" attacks Zigfried's "Valkyrie Brunhilde", but Zigfried activates the second effect of "Valkyrie Brunhilde" to reduce its  DEF  by 1000 ("Valkyrie Brunhilde": 2400/2000 → 1000) and prevent its destruction ( Zigfried  1600 → 900). "Red-Eyes Black Dragon" attacks & destroys Zigfried's "Valkyrie Erste" ( Zigfried  900 → 100). Joey then re-activates "Dangerous Machine Type-6" and Sets a card.
 Turn 14: Zigfried  
Zigfried draws. He then activates " Enchanted Sword Nothung ", equipping it to "Valkyrie Brunhilde" and increasing its ATK by 400  ATK  ("Valkyrie Brunhilde": 2400 → 2800/1000). Now when the equipped monster battles a Dragon-type monster, that monster will be destroyed at the start of the Damage Step without applying Damage Calculation. Since "Enchanted Sword Nothung" was equipped, its second effect activates, destroying Joey's "Red-Eyes Black Dragon" and removing it from play ("Valkyrie Brunhilde": 2800 → 2500/1000). 
 Zigfried then activates " Rainbow Bridge Bifrost " to target "Valkyrie Brunhilde" and increase its ATK by 500 for each of Joey's monsters that are currently removed from play until the End Phase. There are currently five monsters in Joey's Removed from Play Zone ("Valkyrie Brunhilde": 2500 → 5000/1000). 
 "Valkyrie Brunhilde" attacks "Maximum Six", but Joey activates his face-down " Compensation Mediation " to force Zigfried to pick two cards from his  Graveyard  and put them along with "Compensation Mediation" face-down on the field. Joey picks one card. It is revealed to be "Swan Maiden". Because the card that Joey chose was not "Compensation Mediation", its effect is negated. "Valkyrie Brunhilde" then destroys "Maximum Six" ( Joey  800 → 0).
