 Fake Numbers
 
 
 Barian Numbers , known as  Fake Numbers  in the Japanese version, were artificial " Numbers " manufactured by  Don Thousand  (in addition to the " Number 10X " also created by him) in the  Yu-Gi-Oh! ZEXAL  anime. According to  Vector  and  Trey , approximately one million of them were released into the Human World at the beginning of the  Barian Emperor Onslaught .
 
 History 
 In  Yu-Gi-Oh! ZEXAL ,  Don Thousand  used the  Fusionizer  in his hidden  palace  to mass produce artificial " Numbers " which were contained in the device.  Mr. Heartland  describes the effect the Barian "Numbers" could have as a "bravo" one. Under orders from  Vector , Heartland scattered the Barian "Numbers" across the Human World. Barian Numbers were shown as  blank cards  of pink energy when they rained upon  Heartland City . Similar to the real "Numbers," Don Thousand's artificial creations possessed corrupting abilities that manipulated the personality of their hosts. 
 Unlike a real "Number", however, each person who picks up a Barian "Number" gains a  Barian Emblem  on their forehead in the same manner as those controlled by " Rank-Up-Magic Barian's Force ". The ultimate effect of the Barian Numbers were to drive the citizenry of  Heartland City  to riot, increasing the hatred of the people in the  Human World  until it could be matched and  fused  with  Barian World  in  Don Thousand 's agenda. Heartland also notes that those influenced by a Barian Number resonate a unique "frequency" that could be used as a tracking method, as seen when Heartland used the frequency given off by  Flip Turner  to locate the  Numbers Club . The owners of the Barian Numbers were sacrificed to Barian World when the Human World merged with Barian World. The victims of the Barian Numbers were later revived following the defeats of  Don Thousand  and  Nash .
