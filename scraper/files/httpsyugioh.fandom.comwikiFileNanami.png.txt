       Full-body image of Nanami.     
 Maguro is a tanned and muscular boy with brown eyes and short black hair. His eyebrows are shaped like tuna. Appropriately for his school, he wears a combination of swimwear and water safety gear; a skintight navy blue rash shirt and skintight black swim shorts covered with bandages wrapped around his torso, a yellow and red life jacket, red gloves, bandages wrapped around his wrists to keep his gloves watertight, and black water shoes.
 
 Personality 
 Nanami is a young man, who attends "Goha Fishing Elementary School" on board a ship where one can learn about fishing across the oceans around the world. A man who loves the sea more than anyone else, he never allows anything to pollute the sea. He is the captain because of his ability to catch the most fish in the training. He has a habit of saying ~tuna at the end of his sentences and use water-related expressions while dueling.
 
 Etymology 
 Nanami's japanese name means "Tuna of the Seven Seas".
