 History 
 Back in Elementary School, he was reputed to be one of the "Duel Kings", alongside  Dark Kuroda ,  Light Tsukiko  and  Psychic Tendo . Despite being the weakest of the four (according to Kuroda), he's still considered as a very powerful duellist.
 
 Deck 
 Simorgh Deck 
 As his nickname stands, Jukyu's duelling style is based on sheer power. As such, his  Simorgh  Deck is able to perform multiple Special Summons in one turn, allowing him to fill his board with powerful monsters with Spell/Trap negation effects, such as " Simorgh, Lord of the Storm ", " Simorgh of Darkness " and " Mist Valley Apex Avian ".
