 Biography 
 Ted was hired with many other  card professors  to guard the  R.A. Project  by  Yako Tenma . He was introduced to  Yugi Mutou  by  Bandit Keith , after Yugi asked if Keith was the card professor guarding that block of the  KaibaCorp  building.  Dark Yugi  was worried about  Anzu Mazaki  and was tired from his previous Duels. Yugi offered to Duel Ted, but was stopped by  Gekko Tenma , who insisted that he be the one to Duel Ted, as he wished to help Yugi stop  his brother's  schemes. [1]  Ted speculated that Gekko got a bad opening hand after the latter played " Graceful Charity ". He laughed, but also said that he hoped Gekko would get better  draws . After seeing the rest of Gekko's opening move, Ted asked Keith is  Pegasus  really considered Gekko to be a great Duelist. Keith confirmed that Pegasus had actually called Gekko a "perfect Duelist". Wondering what kind of strategy the "perfect Duelist" would use, Ted went on the offensive, with Gekko countering with  Equip Spell  and  Trap Card . Using " Hand-to-Hand Combat ", Ted  negated  Gekko's cards and cut his Life Points in half with " Speed Jaguar ". Gekko played another "Graceful Charity" and Ted wondered why he was throwing so many cards into the  Graveyard . Ted brought out " Assault Lion " and even transferred the  effect  of "Speed Jaguar" to it via " Medicine Eater ". Gekko narrowly avoid defeat with " Amulet of Affection ". Ted was still confident in his victory, as he had  Set  " Stop Defense ", meaning Gekko Summoning a monster in  Defense Position  would be useless. Gekko claimed he still had no monsters in his hand, and Ted laughed. [2] 
 Ted taunted Gekko, saying he must have a very unbalanced  Deck  to have no monsters in his hand. He asked if Gekko wanted to  surrender , with Gekko insisting that the Duel will end this turn with Ted's defeat. Gekko played " Armament Reincarnation ", resurrecting the Equip Spell and Traps he had  discarded  with "Graceful Charity" as monsters. Ted was surprised, but insisted that it didn't matter - none of them could defeat "Assault Lion". Gekko used " Power Connection " to increase the ATK of his monsters and won the Duel. Ted thought he now knew the power of the "perfect Duelist". Keith called Ted weak and viciously assaulted him, eventually knocking him unconscious. [3]
