 Appearance 
       Full-body image of President Goha.     
 Goha conceals his identity beneath a helmet with a design reminiscent of a samurai helmet, with the  Goha Corporation  logo emblazoned on his helmet's forehead and mouthpiece, hexagonal red eyepieces, and silver horns in half-hexagonal shapes. Reportedly, no-one at the Goha Corporation has ever seen his face. He also wears a black mantle with a red stripe across the chest, and black clothing and gloves underneath it.
 
 Personality 
 Despite being the de facto ruler of  Goha City  little is known about Goha's personality. The installation of  Rush Dueling  in defiance of his company's rules seems to have amused Goha more than anything. In his first few appearances, he does not say anything, he merely laughs.
