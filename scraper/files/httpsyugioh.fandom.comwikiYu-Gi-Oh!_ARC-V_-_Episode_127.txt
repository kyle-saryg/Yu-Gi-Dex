 Summary 
       Yuya reunites with his father after three years.     
 In the midst of explaining,  the Professor  is interrupted by a notification of  Yuya 's intrusion into the inner chambers, slightly exhausted from his  Awakening .  Riley ,  Declan , and  Yusho  are relieved to see him, and Yuya hugs his father. The Professor then tells  The Doctor  to immediately begin the  Revival Zero  project as the Doctor stands no fighting chance against Yuya, but the Doctor expresses his overconfidence in his Parasite work and that as fellow researchers, they should be sharing a similar curiosity in confronting Yuya. The Professor agrees then turns the Doctor into  a card , freeing the girls from his brainwashing in the process, as he expresses that his own past curiosity was what caused the  Supreme King Dragon's  birth in the first place. 
 
       Leo reveals the Bracelet girls.     
 The Professor reveals the girls and continues to tell his story of how he investigated a way to stop  Z-ARC 's fused form. By traveling the world and following the theory of Duel Monsters with souls while researching different natural environments, Leo was able to create four  Spell Cards  subtitled under the names "Flowers, Birds, Winds, and Moon" from the natural energy that he believed could counter Z-ARC. However, when Leo had just finished creating the four cards,  Ray  stole the cards, as she could not bear the thought of losing her father.
 
       Ray splitting into four.     
 Leo tried to give chase to his daughter, but she activated one of the cards, destroying the surrounding buildings and blocking his way with rubble. Leo then took a different road and eventually saw Ray confronting Z-ARC, as she activated the four cards, causing the related natural energy sources of flowers, birds, wind, and the moon to react and converge within Ray's body. The reaction of natural energies then created the  Natural Energy Bracelets  on Ray's right hand. The natural energy convergence then caused a reaction in both Ray and Z-ARC's bodies, and subsequently de-fused the Supreme King Dragon from  his dragons  as well as Ray's and Z-ARC's original bodies into four, creating their  dimensional counterparts  and the  Four Dimension Dragons .
 
         Two children tell Leo what Solid Vision is.     
 When Leo opened his eyes next, he found himself flung back in time in the newly formed  Standard Dimension  where no  ARC System  or  Fusion ,  Synchro , or  Xyz Summoning  existed. Suffering from partial amnesia and unable to remember who he was, Leo still retained his research skills, so he made his living by conducting experiments on the standard  KaibaCorp Duel Disk , upgrading the incorporeal Solid Vision into the ARC System as it once was in the Original Dimension. Around this time, he met Yusho and created the  Leo Institute of Dueling , together introducing  Action Duels  to the Standard Dimension. Later, Leo started to remember about his memories of the future, but was unable to guess why, so he created a machine that searched and visualized his future memories, making him realize that Ray was still alive, split within the  Four Dimensions .(In the English Dub, the revelation of the girls' origin is stated at this point.)
 Declan interrupts and elaborates with his view at that time, that Leo was so immersed in his incomprehensible research causing  his mother  to become erratic, and Declan, hoping to bring relief to his mother, wandered into Leo's lab and was transferred to  Duel Academy  in the Fusion Dimension.
 
         Leo Akaba explains that with the ARC-V Reactor (shown above), he will unite the four dimensions to revive his daughter.     
 Leo continues that when on Duel Academy searching for Ray, he instead found  Celina , who resembled Ray in her childhood, but found no traces of Ray's memories in her. In his investigation, he concluded that Ray and Z-ARC must have been split into four and were reborn in separate four dimensions as  Zuzu Boyle , Celina,  Lulu Obsidian ,  Rin , Yuya,   Yuto ,  Yugo , and  Yuri  respectively. Leo reveals the secret chamber behind him containing the carded people from different dimensions from the  Arc Area Project  and his intention to use their natural energy as a catalyst in the  ARC-V  Reactor that will refuse the separated Dimensions back into the  Original Dimension  as well as reviving Ray by fusing her dimensional counterparts as well (In the English Dub, Leo also states that the girls's existences will be erased in the process.), thus fulfilling Revival Zero's goal.
 
         Leo Akaba challenges Declan and Yuya to a Duel.     
 Having finished explaining his motives to Declan, Yusho, Riley, Yuya and Ray's Dimensional counterparts, Leo tells Declan to join him and defeat Yuya immediately, as the fusing of the Four Dimensions will not just result in Ray's fused revival, but Z-ARC's revival as well, opening the possibility that the Supreme Dragon King may be reborn and the only way to stop the undefeated Z-ARC for good is through a Duel. However, Declan rejects his father, stating that he has seen Yuya's true nature in his  Dueltaining , which has brought genuine happiness to the people of different dimensions, and that as the founder of the  Lancers , it is his and Yuya's shared duty to stop Leo's ambitions. The three activate their  Duel Disks , and the Action Field  Crossover  is activated.

 Trivia 
 Despite Yugo and Yuri being present in the cast list, they didn't appear at all in this episode. 
 The dubbed version of the episode, as well as the previous episode, makes direct references to death. This is usually extremely rare for the dubbed versions of Yu-Gi-Oh! shows. 
 This episode is one of the few, if not the only, to not have its title be changed from the original Japanese version.
