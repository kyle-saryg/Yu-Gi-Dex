 Summary 
       Tania crossing the dimensions.     As  Bastion Misawa  had feared, the portal has not led to the  dimension  they were previously in, but a different one entirely.  Jaden Yuki  immediately runs off on his own, desperate to rescue  Jesse Anderson .  Axel Brodie  chases after him, and Bastion ends up falling through weak ground and ends up with Jaden too. They also meet up with  Tania , who explains that some sort of anomaly showed up her own dimension and she ended up in this one. She reveals that many of the weaker Duel Spirits have been enslaved by a group of mid- level   Winged Beast  monsters, led by  Sky Scout . Axel develops a plan to take out their main power supply, as they would be disoriented in the dark. Jaden rushes in to challenge Sky Scout.
 However, Jaden is unaware of the possible consequences of this. Tania reveals that in this dimension, players take real damage. Losing a  Duel  actually results in death (in the dub, this is changed to "sent to the stars", but it's still heavily implied that term is euphemism for death). Tania gets Jaden's attention as the Duel begins and reveals this. Jaden is shocked, while Sky Scout is surprised that rumors of there being a dimension where  Duel Monsters  is not life-or-death are true. Sky Scout states that in this dimension, the only people who have  Duel Disks  are those willing to risk their lives. A Duel cannot be stopped once both Duel Disks are activated, and so Jaden must Duel.
 Sky Scout locks down Jaden's Summoning of high-level  Fusion Monsters  with " Level Tax " and dominates with the ATK and effect of " Simorgh, Bird of Divinity ". Though Jaden is reduced to 100  Life Points , he wins by Summoning " Winged Kuriboh LV10 ". The Duel also distracts Sky Scout from his sentry duty, and allows Axel to shut down the main power generator, disorienting the remaining Winged Beasts and allowing the low-Level monsters to escape their slavers. Sky Scout is defeated by Jaden; he states he has no regrets and that the Duel showed his pride as a warrior, and tells Jaden that he must defeat the one who is the true cause of the war, being someone known as " The Supreme King " (in the Japanese version, Birdman tells Judai that Judai himself must become the Supreme King). He then fades away. Jaden meets up with the rest of his friends and they prepare to continue on. Bastion opts to stay with Tania, supposedly to attempt to find out more information about the dimensions.

 Featured Duel - Jaden Yuki vs. Sky Scout 
 Turn 1: Sky Scout 
Sky Scout draws "Simorgh, Bird of Divinity". He then  activates  " Summon Storm " to pay 800  Life Points  (Sky Scout 4000 → 3200) and  Special Summon  " Whirlwind Prodigy " (1500/1600) in Attack Position. Sky Scout then  Tributes  "Whirlwind Prodigy" in order to Tribute Summon " Simorgh, Bird of Divinity " (2700/1000) in Attack Position (as "Whirlwind Prodigy" counts as two Tributes for the Tribute Summon of a WIND monster). Sky Scout then  sets  a card and activates " Level Tax ". Now as long as "Level Tax" is face-up, neither player can summon a Level 5 or above monster without paying Life Points equal to the ATK of the summoned monster. On Sky Scout's  End Phase , the effect of "Simorgh, Bird of Divinity" activates, inflicting 1000 damage to both players, but Sky Scout takes no damage as he has at least two cards in his  Spell & Trap Card Zone  (Jaden 4000 → 3000).
 Turn 2: Jaden 
Jaden draws " Elemental Hero Bubbleman ". Jaden's hand contains " Polymerization ", " Elemental Hero Clayman ", " Elemental Hero Necroshade ", " Elemental Hero Neos ", and " Elemental Hero Burstinatrix ". Jaden then Normal Summons "Elemental Hero Bubbleman" (800/1200) in  Defense Position . Since "Bubbleman" was summoned while Jaden had no other cards on his side of the field, its effect activates, allowing Jaden to draw two cards (" Winged Kuriboh " and " Fake Hero "). [Notes 1]  Jaden then Sets two cards ("Polymerization" and "Fake Hero"). On Jaden's End Phase, the effect of "Simorgh, Bird of Divinity" activates, but neither player takes any damage.
 Turn 3: Sky Scout 
Sky Scout draws "Wing Requital". He then Normal Summons " Tornado Bird " (1100/1000) in  Attack Position . Sky Scout then activates " Wing Requital " to pay 600  Life Points  (Sky Scout 3200 → 2600) and  draw  one card for each Winged-Beast type monster on his side of the field, however the drawn cards can't be used this turn. Since Sky Scout has two Winged-Beast type monsters on his side of the field, he draws two cards. 
 "Simorgh, Bird of Divinity" then attacks and destroys "Elemental Hero Bubbleman". "Tornado Bird" then attacks  directly  (Jaden 3000 → 1900). Sky Scout then Sets two cards. On Sky Scout's End Phase, the effect of "Simorgh, Bird of Divinity" activates, but neither player takes any damage.
 Turn 4: Jaden 
Jaden draws " Graceful Charity " and subsequently activates it to draw three cards and  discard  two cards ("Elemental Hero Burstinatrix" and "Elemental Hero Necroshade"). Jaden then Normal Summons " Neo-Spacian Grand Mole " (900/300) in Attack Position. "Grand Mole" attacks "Simorgh, Bird of Divinity" with Jaden intending to activate the effect of "Grand Mole" and return to "Simorgh" to Sky Scout's hand, however Sky Scout activates his face-down " Glory Level Talisman " and equips the latter to "Simorgh, Bird of Divinity". Due to the second effect of "Glory Level Talisman", "Grand Mole" is destroyed as its Level was lower than the Level of "Simorgh".
 Sky Scout then activates his face-down " Icarus Attack " to Tribute "Tornado Bird" and destroy two of Jaden's  Set  cards ("Polymerization" and "Fake Hero"). Sky Scout then activates his face-down " Explosion Wing " to inflict 500 damage to Jaden for each of his cards that were destroyed this turn by a card effect. Three cards were destroyed by an effect (Jaden 1900 → 400). Jaden then Sets two cards. On Jaden's End Phase, the effect of "Simorgh, Bird of Divinity" activates, but neither player takes any damage.
 Turn 5: Sky Scout 
Sky Scout draws. "Simorgh, Bird of Divinity" then attacks directly, but Jaden activates his face-down " A Hero Emerges " to make Sky Scout select one card in his hand. If the selected card is a monster, Jaden can Special Summon that monster. Sky Scout selects a card and Jaden reveals that card to be "Winged Kuriboh", so Jaden  Special Summons  "Winged Kuriboh" (300/200) in Attack Position. 
 Jaden then activates his face-down " Transcendent Wings " to discard "Elemental Hero Neos" and "Elemental Hero Clayman" and send "Winged Kuriboh" to the Graveyard in order to  Special Summon  " Winged Kuriboh LV10 " (300/200) in Attack Position. The effect of "Level Tax" activates (Jaden 400 → 100). Jaden then  Tributes  "Winged Kuriboh LV10" in order to destroy " Simorgh, Bird of Divinity " and inflict its  ATK  as damage to Sky Scout (Sky Scout 2600 → 0).
 
 Mistakes 
 In the English dub, after  Jaden  draws " Elemental Hero Bubbleman ", he briefly thinks that if he Fusion Summons " Elemental Hero Mudballman ", it would "have enough ATK points to take down his " Simorgh ", which is untrue due to the fact that "Mudballman" has only 1900 ATK compared to the 2700 ATK of "Simorgh". This is in contrast to the Japanese episode, where Jaden thinks he can stave off "Simorgh" with the DEF of "Mudballman". But ultimately in both versions, he discards the idea in fear of the combined effects of " Level Tax " and "Simorgh". 
 Sky Scout  does not activate " Wing Requital " in the English dub; instead, he claims it is the effect name of his " Tornado Bird " when he activates its effect. This is understandable, as the "Wind Requital" card never appeared in the Japanese episode either.

 ↑   This card can be seen while Jaden is thinking about what kind of strategy to use in his first turn.
