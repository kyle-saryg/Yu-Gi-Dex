A  Deck Master ability  is an effect possessed by  Deck Masters  during the  Virtual World  arc. Each ability is specific to one monster.
 In all cases in which a Deck Master was used as a  Fusion Material Monster , the resulting  Fusion Monster  was able to  attack  in the same  turn . This was not the case for other fusions, as the arc was using variations of the  Battle City Rules .
