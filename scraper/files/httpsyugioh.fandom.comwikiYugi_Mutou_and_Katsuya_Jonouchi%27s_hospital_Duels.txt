 Yugi Mutou  and  Katsuya Jonouchi  faced each other in a number of games of  Duel Monsters , when Yugi was recovering in hospital after the  Black Clown  fire. The Duels took place without the use of  Solid Vision  projectors.
 
 Events 
 Yugi had " Swords of Revealing Light " in play. He  Sacrificed  " Terra the Terrible " and " Tyhone " to Summon " Dark Magician ". "Dark Magician"  attacked  and  destroyed  Jonouchi's " Kung Fu Fighter Ultimator ", taking out Jonouchi's remaining  Life Points , winning the Duel for Yugi. [1] 
 Yugi celebrated and  Bakura  asked Jonouchi how many he had lost now. Jonouchi questioned his bad luck, but  Anzu  suggested it was difference in skill, rather than luck. When Jonouchi proposed another Duel, Anzu reminded them that Yugi needed to be taking it easy. Yugi insisted he was fine and Honda said to let them play, as it would take Yugi's mind off the pain. [1] 
 Jonouchi lost another game and blamed it on bad luck. Yugi asked if Jonouchi was using the same Deck he used for  Duelist Kingdom . Jonouchi proudly replied that he defeated some strong enemies with it, so he planned to stick with it for a while. However Yugi had come up with a strategy to counter that Deck, so he recommended that Jonouchi build a new one, like he and  Dark Yugi  had done over the past three days. [1]
