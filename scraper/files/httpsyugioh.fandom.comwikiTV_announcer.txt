 Biography 
 The TV announcer read the news of a string of robberies, in which the behavior matched that of the recently escaped  Tetsuo Sasaki . He also announced a robbery of  Ushijima Finance , where the criminal left empty-handed because the safe had been emptied earlier, stating they were unsure if it was linked to the other robberies. Unbeknownst to the news team, the successful robberies were committed by  Jiro the Jorogumo , who was posing as Tetsuo. And the unsuccessful one was committed by the real Tetsuo, who was angry at how his crime was ridiculed and he was being blamed for other crimes he did not commit. [1]
