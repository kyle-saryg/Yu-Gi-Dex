 Biography 
 Shimon was originally one of  Pharaoh Akhenamkhanen 's guardians, and he was granted the  Millennium Key  to hold. His  Ka  (or his monster spirit) that he summoned was " Exodia the Forbidden One " and after he used Exodia to destroy the force that was attacking the Egyptian capital, he swore to never use it again and sealed the creature away inside five individual stone tablets. He apparently gave up his position as guardian to  Shada , and to him he relinquished the Millennium Key.
 He plays a largely minor role in the  Millennium World  arc at first, as he introduces much of the ancient ways and terminology to  Pharaoh Atem .
 When  Zorc Necrophades  rises and begins to march on the city, Shimon takes up the  Millennium Key  that  Isis  brought back and he summons Exodia to combat Zorc. Although Exodia experiences some success, especially after Shimon demonstrates its ability to regenerate after its arm was torn off by Zorc, Zorc ultimately overpowers Exodia because its power is based on Shimon's, while Zorc can draw power from the darkness. Therefore, Exodia is destroyed and Shimon is killed,trapped in the shadow realm in the dub makes almost no difference though.
