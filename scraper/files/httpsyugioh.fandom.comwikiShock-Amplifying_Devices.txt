      Electrodes     
 Electrodes , known as  Shock-Amplifying Devices  in the Japanese version, are a kind of collar used in Underground Duels. When in use, a Duelist wears three; one around the neck, and one around each arm. They were first shown when  Zane  Dueled against  Mad Dog  in an attempt to gain more power. When a Duelist loses  Life Points  while wearing an electrode, a severe electric shock is sent through their body causing them great pain. After his Duel with Mad Dog, Zane used them again in a Duel against his younger brother  Syrus . When Zane was starting to have heart problems, he first thought that the electrodes were to blame. It was later revealed to be his " Cyberdark " Deck causing the trouble. While in the  alternate dimension , Zane used them to take  Doom Dozer  down, before he ultimately destroyed it with " Cyber End Dragon ".
