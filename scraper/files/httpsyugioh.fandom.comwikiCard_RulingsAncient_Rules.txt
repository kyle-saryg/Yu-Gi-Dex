 Previously Official Rulings 
   These TCG rulings were issued by  Upper Deck Entertainment  and have since been deemed unofficial by Konami. [1]  They were previously considered official and can still be correct, as long as they follow the official gameplay rules, or unless Konami has issued a ruling that says otherwise. References:  [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] 
 
 If an effect is  chained  to the activation of “ Ancient Rules ” that causes you to  discard  the only  Level  5 or higher  Normal Monster (s) in your  hand , your opponent may look at your  hand  to confirm this when “ Ancient Rules ”  resolves .
