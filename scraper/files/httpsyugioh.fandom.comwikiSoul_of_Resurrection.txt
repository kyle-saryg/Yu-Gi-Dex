After battling, "Dragonecro Nethersoul Dragon" Special Summons a "Dark Soul Token" with the original Level and ATK of the monster it attacked. Use this Token to attack the monster with 0 ATK!
 
 "  Zombie Master  " 
 Lets you discard a monster from your hand to Special Summon a Level 4 or lower Zombie-Type monster from either player's Graveyard, once per turn.
Use Bonz's Level-Up Reward " Zombie World " and turn the monsters in both players' Graveyards into Zombie-Types, then you can Special Summon from your opponents Graveyard!

When you Special Summon it, you can return any number of your Zombie-Type Synchro Monsters that are banished or in your Graveyard to the Extra Deck, and destroy face-up cards your opponent controls up to the number of cards you returned!
In addition, when a Zombie-Type monster would be destroyed by battle or card effect, you can banish a "Shiranui" monster from your Graveyard instead.
