 Biography 
 Five-Eyed Horned Ogre was a monster  ka , residing in the soul of a man taken prisoner during the  ka  hunt . When taken captive, it was a small weak  ka . [1] 
 Gebelk  discovered that he could quickly increase the strength of such  ka  by forcing the wielders to struggle for survival. As such he had ten criminals, including Five-Eyed Horned Ogre's host engage in  a battle , where only one wielder could leave the arena alive. After 34 hours of on and off battling, Five-Eyed Horned Ogre and  Gudoul  were the only surviving  ka  and had significantly grown in strength. [1] 
 The battle was interrupted, when Gebelk and  Akhenaden  hoped to test  Kisara  and her ka,  The White Dragon . When Kisara was put in the arena, the prisoners focused their  ka  on her.  Seto  intervened and had his  ka ,  Duos , cut the arena's suspension chains, causing Five-Eyed Horned Ogre and its host to fall to their deaths. [2]
