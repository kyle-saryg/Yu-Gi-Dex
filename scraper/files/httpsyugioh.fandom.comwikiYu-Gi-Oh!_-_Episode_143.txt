 Summary 
 With  Kaiba 's  Battle City  tournament completed, and the Alcatraz tower set to explode in less than an hour, Kaiba and  Mokuba  are still nowhere to be found.  Yugi  and the gang continue to search for them, but they are revealed to still be in the island's control room. 
 Kaiba thinks back to his duel against Yugi. Mokuba tells him the codes have been input and that they should both leave the island. Kaiba continues to have flashbacks to both his time in the Virtual World (which includes confronting  Gozaburo Kaiba ) and the time he spent at the orphanage with Mokuba. With just 13 minutes left before  Alcatraz  is destroyed, everyone is about to give up and go back to the Battle Ship when  Duke  and  Bakura  arrive. They tell the group the engine of KaibaCorp's blimp cannot be repaired.  Joey  freaks out, and is about to run to the ship when he sees a helicopter, the very same which should have taken him to a proper hospital while he was still sick. 
 
       The gang fleeing in a helicopter as Alcatraz explodes and sinks.     
 Mai  and  Serenity  go warn  Ishizu ,  Marik , and  Odion  they are going to abandon the blimp in favor of the helicopter. The helicopter takes off with less than 1 minute to go, and the gang watches from the air as Alcatraz is destroyed by explosions. Suddenly out of the smoke the group sees a... " Blue-Eyes White Dragon "!! It is actually KaibaCorp's special Blue-Eyes jet, with Kaiba and Mokuba in the cockpit. After a brief exchange of words, Kaiba flies off in a different direction from the chopper. 
 
       The heroes celebrating the end of Battle City.     
 Back on the mainland, Ishizu and Marik thank Yugi for helping to defeat  Yami Marik . Marik tells Yugi that on the day Yugi visits Egypt he wishes to be his guide. The Ishtars then leave with Odion to go back home. Duke then has to leave to work on  Dungeon Dice Monsters , but not before leaving Serenity his cell number. Mai then announces that since Battle City is over, she is growing restless. After Mai and Serenity exchange words of thanks between them, she tells Yugi she won't lose to him again before departing. 
 
       Yami Yugi  prepares to face  Joey .     
 The next morning,  Yami  is preparing his  deck  when Yugi gives him a card: the " Red-Eyes Black Dragon ", with a nod of approval from Yami. While sneaking out the door, Yugi is caught by  his grandpa . When asked where he's going, Yugi simply states he has something to do. Grandpa says to be careful. Somewhere in the city, Yugi approaches a waiting Joey. With a few more flashbacks from  Duelist Kingdom  and Battle City, the episode ends with Yami Yugi and Joey facing off, ready to duel, with the sun rising behind Joey.
