 "Armory Call" (or " Swords at Dawn " targeting this card in your Graveyard) can equip this card to a " Mermail " monster in response to your opponent's Trap Card, in order to negate it. 
 Because this card negation is attached to a  Continuous-like Effect , it is able to negate your opponent's  Counter Trap Cards , though it will only negate the first such Trap Card your opponent activates, regardless of its classification.
