 Recommended Cards 
 
 " Angel of Zera " This monster already has a high ATK, but will gain additional ATK for each of your opponent's banished cards. In addition, even if this card is banished, it will Special Summon itself on the next Standby Phase. 
" Eccentric Boy " A Tuner monster that allows you to use a monster in your hand as a Synchro Material. This means that uf you have a Level 5 monster in your hand, you'll be able to Synchro Summon a Level 8 Synchro Monster immediately. However, the Synchro Summoned monster will have its effect negated, so be sure to Synchro Summon a monster with high ATK/DEF. 
" The Tricky " A monster that can be Special Summoned from your hand by discarding 1 card. It can be used for a plethora of combos, such as using it as a tribute, or discarding a card that activates in the Graveyard. 
" Drowning Mirror Force " A Trap Card that can be activated when your opponent declares a direct attack. All of your opponent's monsters in attack position will be sent back to your opponent's Deck. Use it to turn the tides of battle!
