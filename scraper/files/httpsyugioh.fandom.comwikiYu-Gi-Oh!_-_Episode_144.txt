 Summary 
 Téa  shows  Serenity  around the town as she was not able to witness it earlier due to her blindness operation.
 Flashbacks are frequent in this episode, all of  Joey 's  Battle City  Duels are shown except for his Duels with  Weevil  and  Mako .
 Tea starts the tour by taking Serenity to the Domino museum. Tea shows Serenity the stone tablet that depicts the Duel Yami Yugi and the Sorcerer had 5000 years ago. After that Tea takes Serenity to the pier where Joey and Yugi Dueled when Joey was controlled by Marik. The girls reminisce about the Duel and then head off to the park. Here they see several kids Dueling each other. Serenity thinks it's cute, but Tea remarks that Noah was also a kid and anything but cute. Tea continues by saying that the kids in the park Duel just for fun, but that when Yugi Duels, a lot more is at stake. This causes her to remember the conversation she had with Yugi right before his Duel with Kaiba in the finals. The girls move on and Serenity notice that Tea is absent. Tea tells her that she was supposed to meet Yugi. Serenity apologizes for taking up her time and that she should have said something. Tea assures her that it's alright and that she can't believe Serenity is leaving and going to be far away. Serenity says that because of their friendship bond, she'll always be close by. 
 Téa and Serenity see Yugi from far and Serenity feels that Téa wants to see Yugi, so she says that Téa should go see Yugi, and Serenity says that she's fine walking around the town alone. Téa parts with Serenity and thinks that one day Yami Yugi will be gone. And Téa thinks that as long as he has not gone yet, she should enjoy the time together with Yami Yugi.
 The episode ends with Téa running off to see Yami Yugi and he watches as she approaches him.
