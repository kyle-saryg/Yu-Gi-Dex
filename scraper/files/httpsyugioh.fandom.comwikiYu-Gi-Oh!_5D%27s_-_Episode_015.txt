 Summary 
 Preparation 
 Before the contestants of the  Fortune Cup  appear at the ceremony,  Yusei ,  Leo ,  Luna ,  Dexter ,  Yanagi  and  Tanner  prepare in a corridor. Leo, now disguised as Luna, in order to participate instead of her, asks how he looks. After getting too excited, Luna kicks him, reminding him she doesn't act like that. As Yusei and Leo depart to the ceremony, Yusei advises Leo to lose the make-up. Tanner remains silent, positive the Fortune Cup is a setup.
 
 Fortune Cup begins 
       The contestants.     
 The  MC  announces the Fortune Cup is getting started, before  Jack Atlas  and " Red Dragon Archfiend " entertain the crowd. Jack and Red Dragon stop in the center of the stadium and the contestants rise into the stadium. The audience spots Yusei's  criminal mark  and begin to mutter to each other. Thoughts that Yusei may have stolen an invitation and such are spread among the crowd. Yusei's friends are uneasy, but Yusei tells Leo to pay no attention. The MC is left speechless.  Greiger  walks over to him and takes his microphone and asks everyone, as a duelist up there, what it is everyone sees. He points to Yusei saying he is undoubtedly a duelist, selected under the same conditions as all contestants. Having cards, marker or not, they are all the same, no one there should be ashamed of anything, he assures the crowd, it is rather them, looking at him, through their trivial rose-colored glasses that are no short of vicious. The crowd remains silent until  Rex Goodwin  applauds Greiger after which everyone follows. Goodwin thanks Greiger and reminds everyone of the equality of the players. The MC announces who will be in the first round as the screens randomly pair up the players. Leo is put in the first Duel against Greiger.
 Rex and  Lazar , now in a box room talk with  Zigzix  on a monitor. They will shortly have all the  Signers  together. Once they get them to Duel at maximum potential, it will cause the  Ener-D  system to respond. Zigzix has installed a number of D-Sensors throughout the stadium, which will apprehend a full account of a Signer's response heightened by the Dueling.
 As the contestants prepare, Leo tells Yusei to meet him in the finals and recollects on what Yusei told him after their duel.
 
 The Duel 
       Leo acts feminine.     
 The MC announces the contestants Luna and Greiger. As Leo and Greiger shake hands, Leo tells Greiger that he liked his speech earlier. Greiger says that he heard Luna was a girl, he seems like a boy to him. Leo stumbles back laughing protecting his disguise saying people think he's a boy, but he'd say he's girl enough as he strikes a more feminine posture. In the crowd, Luna gets angered, saying that she doesn't act like that.
 
       Leo acts out of character as Luna.     
 Leo gets excited as he duels, much to Luna's dismay. Greiger wishes his opponent to put up a good fight, even defeat him with the  "Power of the dragon."  Zigzix is unable to get a reading on his sensor, so he turns up the power. Luna begins to ache as he does this. While Zigzix gets no reaction on his scanners Lazar assures him they have checked that Luna is a Signer. Zigzix informs Lazar, that while he isn't getting a response from the field, he is getting a small reaction from the audience. Zigzix manages to pin point the reaction to be coming from Luna. Leo takes much damage from Greiger's card effects, but manages to pull off his combo. Leo attacks for apparent victory, but Greiger manages to remains in control and win.
 
 Aftermath 
 After the Duel, Lazar meets with Greiger. He confirms Greiger's thought that he was dueling a boy, as he shows him paperwork revealing Luna to have a twin brother. Zigzix asks Goodwin how he is to handle the situation as Goodwin grins at the image of Luna in the audience.
 
 Featured Duel: Leo vs. Greiger 
 Turn 1: Greiger 
Greiger's hand contains "Damage Summon", "Trap Reactor・Y FI", "Star Blast", "Spell Reactor・RE", and " Nobleman of Crossout ". Greiger draws "Summon Reactor・SK". He then activates " Star Blast " to pay 500  LP  (Greiger 4000 → 3500) and reduce the  Level  of " Summon Reactor・SK " by one ("Summon Reactor・SK": Level 5 → 4). Greiger then Normal Summons "Summon Reactor・SK" (2000/1400) in  Attack Position  and  Sets  a card. On Greiger's End Phase, the effect of "Star Blast" expires ("Summon Reactor・SK": Level 4 → 5).
 Turn 2: Leo 
Leo draws " Morphtronic Celfon " and subsequently Normal Summons it (100/100) in Attack Position. The first effect of "Summon Reactor・SK" then activates, inflicting 800 damage to Leo (Leo 4000 → 3200). Leo then activates the Attack Position effect of "Morphtronic Celfon" to roll a die. Leo gets a two, so he picks up the top two cards of his Deck. Leo finds "Morphtronic Boomboxen" among the picked up cards, so he  Special Summons  " Morphtronic Boomboxen " (1200/400) in  Defense Position  and returns the remaining cards to his Deck. Leo Sets a card.
 Turn 3: Greiger 
Greiger draws "Delta Reactor". He then Normal Summons " Trap Reactor・Y FI " (800/1800) in Attack Position. "Trap Reactor・Y FI" attacks "Morphtronic Celfon", but Leo activates his face-down " Morphtransition " to negate the attack and switch "Morphtronic Celfon" to Defense Position. The effect of "Trap Reactor・Y FI" activates, destroying "Morphtransition" and inflicting 800 damage to Leo (Leo 3200 → 2400). 
 "Summon Reactor・SK" attacks "Morphtronic Boomboxen", but Leo activates the Defense Position effect of "Morphtronic Boomboxen" to negate the attack. Greiger then activates his face-down " Damage Summon " to pay 800 LP (Greiger 3500 → 2700) and Special Summon " Spell Reactor・RE " from his hand (1200/900) in Attack Position (as "Summon Reactor・SK" attacked, but its attack target was not destroyed). "Spell Reactor・RE" attacks and destroys "Morphtronic Boomboxen". Greiger Sets a card. 
 Turn 4: Leo 
Leo's hand contains " Morphtronic Magnen ", "Gadget Hauler", " Magical Mallet " and " Twister ". Leo draws " Factory of 100 Machines ". He then activates the Defense Position effect of "Morphtronic Celfon" to roll a die. Leo gets a three, so he checks the top three cards of his Deck (" Morphtronic Datatron ", " Gadget Box ", and "Morphtronic Magnen") and returns them to the top of his Deck in the order they were originally in. 
 Leo then switches "Morphtronic Celfon" to Attack Position and activates its Attack Position effect to roll a die. Leo gets a one, so he checks the top card of his Deck. It is "Morphtronic Datatron", so he Special Summons "Morphtronic Datatron" (1200/600) in Attack Position. The first effect of "Summon Reactor・SK" activates (Leo 2400 → 1600). 
 Leo then activates the Attack Position effect of "Morphtronic Datatron" to Tribute "Morphtronic Celfon" and inflict 600 damage to Greiger (Greiger 2700 → 2100). Leo then Tributes "Morphtronic Datatron" in order to Tribute Summon " Gadget Hauler " (1300/0) in Attack Position. Leo then activates the effect of "Gadget Hauler" to send "Morphtronic Magnen" from his hand to the Graveyard and increase its ATK by 800 ("Gadget Hauler": 1300 → 2100/0). 
 Leo then activates "Factory of 100 Machines" to remove from play all " Morphtronic " monsters from his Graveyard and increase the ATK of "Gadget Hauler" by 800 (200 for each "Morphtronic" monster removed this way) ("Gadget Hauler": 2100 → 2900/0). The effect of "Spell Reactor・RE" activates, destroying "Factory of 100 Machines" and inflicting 800 damage to Leo (Leo 1600 → 800). 
 "Gadget Hauler" then attacks "Trap Reactor・Y FI", but Greiger activates his face-down " Delta Reactor " to send his three monsters to the Graveyard and Special Summon " Flying Fortress SKY FIRE " (3000/2500) in Attack Position, ignoring the Summoning Conditions. A replay then occurs and Leo chooses not to attack. On Leo's End Phase, the effect of "Factory of 100 Machines" expires ("Gadget Hauler": 2900 → 2100/0).
 Turn 5: Greiger 
Greiger draws. He then activates the second effect of "Flying Fortress SKY FIRE" to send one card in his hand to the Graveyard and destroy "Gadget Hauler". "Flying Fortress SKY FIRE" attacks directly (Leo 800 → 0).
 
 Naming conflict 
         Linework by Kazuki Takahashi.     
         "Lua and Luca's" names in the Japanese episode. The English version erased these names.     
 In the Japanese version, the names on Jeager ( Lazar 's) files concerning the twins stated their names to be  Lua  and  Luca . Although lineart by  Kazuki Takahashi  has stated that their names are  Rua  and  Ruka .  A later episode , also spelled Rua's name as such.
 The difference is due to  common confusion between the letters "L" and "R"  among Japanese speakers.
 
 Mistakes 
 In both versions, it is not mentioned that Leo was ending his turn when Greiger used the  effect  of  "Flying Fortress SKY FIRE" to destroy Leo's monster. 
 In the English version, when Greiger summons "Summon Reactor・SK", it uses a LP counter to display the ATK rather than an ATK counter.
