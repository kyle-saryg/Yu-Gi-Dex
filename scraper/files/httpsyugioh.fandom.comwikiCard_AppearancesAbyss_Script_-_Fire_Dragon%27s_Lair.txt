 Yu-Gi-Oh! ARC-V 
 In  episode 101 ,  Sylvio Sawatari  plays this card during his tag duel with  Gong Strong  against  Kite Tenjo . Sylvio adds this card from his deck to his hand using the effect of " Abyss Actor - Superstar ", and activates it, targeting "Superstar". Sylvio expected to use this card's effect when "Superstar" destroys a monster by battle, but Kite activates " Cipher Shield " to prevent " Cipher " monsters of the same name that he controls from being destroyed by battle. As a result, Sylvio was unable to prevent Kite from  Xyz Summoning  " Galaxy-Eyes Cipher Dragon ".
