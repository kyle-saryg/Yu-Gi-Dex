 " Steelswarm Roach " and " Steelswarm Sentinel " are featured in this card's artwork.
 This card may be a reference to the notion that "Steelswarm Roach" is the adult form of "Steelswarm Sentinel".
 The ring surrounding "Steelswarm Sentinel" resembles a " Vylon " artifact. 
 The "Advance" in this card's name is a reference to an " Advance  Summon", the  OCG  term for a  Tribute Summon .
 Oddly, this card (and therefore its name) was first released in the  TCG , not the  OCG . 
 This card has a counterpart in " Trial and Tribulation ":
 Their effects are dependent on the number of monsters tributed, and both of them were first announced as TCG exclusive cards.
