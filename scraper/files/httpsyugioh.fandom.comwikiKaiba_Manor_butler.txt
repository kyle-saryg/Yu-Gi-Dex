 The butler is a sadistic man, under  Seto Kaiba 's employment. He served as both the butler at  Kaiba Manor  and the orchestrator of the  Electric Chair Ride  in  Death-T .
 
 Biography 
 The butler once worked as a torturer, where he learned to resist torture himself, before being employed by the Kaiba family. [1] 
 Using his skills as a torturer, he designed the  Electric Chair Ride  part of  Kaiba 's  Death-T  theme park. The ride was designed to make the participants scream, which they must resist doing to avoid being electrocuted with ten million volts. [1] 
 Before the  grand opening  of  Kaiba Land , the butler welcomed  Yugi Mutou  and  Katsuya Jonouchi  to  Kaiba Manor . He along with other servants greeted them and  Mokuba  when they arrived. He explained that Kaiba would not be attending the pre-celebration for the grand opening of his special project, as he has retired to his room, having worked nonstop for the few days. Mokuba got him to prepare six meals, including two poisoned ones for his rigged game of  Russian Roulette Dinner  with Yugi and Jonouchi. When the game backfired and Mokuba was poisoned, the butler came to his aid. [2]

 The next day, Yugi was forced to take part in  Death-T . The butler, dressed in dark robes, met him and his friends in the  Horror Zone  in  Death T-2 . His sudden appearance gave Jonouchi a fright. He cackled that if that scared Jonouchi, Jonouchi would not be able to survive the next ride. He was about to lead the group to the  Electric Chair Ride , when Yugi recognized him as the butler from Kaiba's mansion. He was hoping that they would not notice, but nevertheless proceeded and took them to a car on a set of rails. [1] 
 Yugi, Jonouchi,  Honda  and  Anzu  took seats on the car and  Johji  sat on Anzu's lap. The bulter locked them on, by cuffing their hands to the arm rests and had helmets with voice detectors put on their heads. He explained that they were about to take part on a ride, where they must not scream or they would be electrocuted. He too took part in the game, running the risk of being electrocuted. Having designed the ride and knowing how to avoid screaming, he thought he should be fine and could use his torture skills to make the others scream. [1] 
 The butler subjected the group to scary projections of monsters. Impressed that they managed to avoid screaming, he moved onto the next phase. Mechanical hands came out of the chairs and started to feel and grope the players. Johji worried that Anzu was going to scream, so he got down from her lap and went back to the butler, where he defecated on his lap. Once the butler realized what happened, he screamed out loud and was electrocuted. [1]
