 Summary 
 Yami Yugi  continues to struggle in his Duel against  Gansley ; however, he eventually wins with the help of " Kuriboh 's"  Deck Master Ability . 
 Téa  wakes up in a cave, having been kidnapped by a group of " Hitotsu-Me Giants ". She discovers they plan on cooking her, but she is rescued when a penguin drops a vine down a hole in the cave ceiling for her.
 After escaping, the "Hitotsu-Me Giants" chase her over a wooden bridge, which collapses under their weight. The giants fall to their deaths while Téa barely holds on. 
 Featured Duel: Yami Yugi vs. Gansley 
 Duel continues from  the previous episode .
 Yami Yugi has 500  Life Points  remaining and controls "Obnoxious Celtic Guardian (1400/1200) and "Chimera the Flying Mythical Beast" (2100/1800) in Attack Position.
 Gansley has 1800 Life Points remaining and controls "Ruklamba the Spirit King" (1000/2000) and "Wall of Illusion" (1000/1850) in Attack Position.
 Turn 7: Gansley 
 Gansley   draws  "Rainbow Snake Eingana", while his hand contains " Melchid the Four-Face Beast ", " Ashingray ", and " Ruklamba the Spirit King ". Gansley  Normal Summons  "Melchid the Four-Face Beast" (1500/1200) in  Attack Position . "Melchid"  attacks  and  destroys  " Obnoxious Celtic Guardian " (Yugi 500 → 400).
 Turn 8: Yugi 
 Yugi  draws "Rainbow Blessing" and subsequently  Sets  it.
 Turn 9: Gansley 
Gansley draws " Offerings to the Doomed " and subsequently  activates  it to destroy " Chimera the Flying Mythical Beast " at the cost of skipping his next  Draw Phase . Since "Chimera" was destroyed, Yugi activates the effect of "Chimera" to revive " Berfomet " (1400/1800) in  Defense Position .
 
       " Rainbow Snake Eingana " swallows " Berfomet ", leaving Yugi with no monsters on the field.     
 Gansley  Tributes  "Melchid" and " Wall of Illusion " to  Tribute Summon  " Rainbow Snake Eingana " (2200/2400) in Attack Position. "Eingana" attacks and destroys "Berfomet". "Ruklamba the Spirit King" then attacks  directly , but Yugi activates his  Deck Master 's  ability  to  negate  the attack and move his Deck Master, " Kuriboh " (300/200), to the field in Attack Position.
 Turn 10: Yugi 
Yugi draws "Swift Gaia the Fierce Knight". He then activates his face-down " Rainbow Blessing ",  equipping  it to "Kuriboh". As he has no other cards in his hand, Yugi Normal Summons " Swift Gaia the Fierce Knight " (2300/1700) in Attack Position without Tributing. Yugi activates the effect of "Rainbow Blessing" to Tribute the equipped "Kuriboh" and allow all other monsters he  controls  to attack directly this  turn  (Tributing your Deck Master does not cause you to lose the duel as long as you can immediately replace it, so presumably "Swift Gaia" became Yugi's new Deck Master). "Swift Gaia" attacks directly (Gansley does not activate his Deck Master's ability at this point as it doesn't stop direct attacks) (Gansley 1800 → 0).
 
 Differences in adaptations 
 In the dub, " Offerings to the Doomed " is changed to remove the cross and religious imagery. 
 The sequence showing " Eingana " swallowing " Berfomet " is cut from the dub. 
 The cut on  Téa 's face is removed in the dub. 
 The shot of " Swift Gaia the Fierce Knight " impaling " Deepasea Warrior "/Gansley is obscured in the dub. The shot of the latter disintegrating after his Life Points hit 0 is also removed from the dub. 
 In the original, "Chimera the Flying Mythical Beast" is shown as a Grey card instead of Green in Yami Yugi's Duel Disk when he was setting "Rainbow Blessing" unlike the dub version which edited this Mistake. 
 When Téa thinks of her friends, a shot of the Symbol of Friendship is superimposed over the shot of her friends.
