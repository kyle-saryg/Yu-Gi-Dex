 Biography 
 After  Priest Seto  won a mock ka battle, by sacrificing his teammates ka, Atem explained that a battle relying on strength can sometimes reveal an unforeseen weakness and that true power would never mean hurting one's friends. Seto requested a demonstration of such power and Atem agreed to another mock battle. Atem choose to summon Kuriboh. Seto, who had anticipated seeing a God Summoned, regarded this as an insult and got Duos to shatter Kuriboh's tablet before Kuriboh could materialize. However a Kuriboh materialized from each fragment of the broken tablet. Atem explained that this was Kuriboh's special power and by attacking without thinking, one loses. [1]
