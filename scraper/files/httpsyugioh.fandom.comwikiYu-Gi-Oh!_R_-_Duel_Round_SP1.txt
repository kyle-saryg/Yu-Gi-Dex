 Summary 
 Yugi   Duels   Masumi Momono .
 
 Featured Duel: Dark Yugi vs. Masumi Momono 
 Turn 1: Masumi 
 Masumi   Sets  a card and  Normal Summons  " Tellus the Little Angel " (500/500) in  Defense Position .
 Turn 2: Yugi 
 Yugi  Normal Summons " Bau the Black Dog Beast " (1800/1200) in  Attack Position . It  attacks  and  destroys  "Tellus". The  effect  of the latter card  activates , leaving its " wing " (0/0) on the  field  in Defense Position. Yugi Sets a card.
 Turn 3: Masumi 
Masumi Sets a card. He then  Tributes  "Tellus Wing" to Normal Summon " Krepaal " (2200/1800) in Attack Position. It attacks "Bau", but Yugi activates his face-down " Negate Attack ",  negating  the attack and ending the  Battle Phase .
 Turn 4: Yugi 
Yugi Sets a card. He then Tributes "Bau" to Normal Summon " Dark Red Enchanter " (2300/2200) in Attack Position. It attacks "Krepaal", but Masumi activates his face-down " Polarizing Prism ", destroying "Dark Red Enchanter"
 Turn 5: Masumi 
Masumi Sets a card and attacks  directly  with "Krepaal" (Yugi 4000 → 1800). Yugi activates his face-down " Stairway to the Underworld ",  Special Summoning  " Gorz the Emissary of Darkness " (2700/2500) and " Kaien the Emissary of Darkness " (2500/2700) from his  Deck  in Attack Position, as he took damage from a direct attack while he  controls  no monsters.
 Turn 6: Yugi 
Yugi attacks "Krepaal", but Masumi activate his face-down " Refracting Prism ", splitting "Krepaal" in two (1100/900 each). "Gorz" and "Kaien" each attack and destroy a "Krepaal" (Masumi 4000 → 1000). Masumi activates the effect of the " Tualatin " (2800/2500) in his hand, Special Summoning it as two of his monsters were destroyed simultaneously. Its effect destroys all  DARK  monsters on the field, so "Gorz" and "Kaien" are destroyed. Yugi Sets a card, but Masumi activates his face-down " Disarm " to destroy it. Yugi activates his face-down " Domain of the Dark Ruler ", negating "Disarm". It will negate any  Magic  or  Trap Card  activated as long it remains face-up. As Yugi negated a card effect, he may Special Summon " Van'Dalgyon the Dark Dragon Lord " (2800/2500) from his hand in Attack Position. Since "Van'Dalgyon", a DARK monster, is on the field, "Tualatin" is destroyed.
 Turn 7: Masumi 
Masumi passes.
 Turn 8: Yugi 
"Van'Dalgyon" attacks directly (Masumi 1000 → 0).
