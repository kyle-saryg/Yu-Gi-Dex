Nature Crooz  (ネイチャークルーズ  Neichā Kurūzu ) is a roller coaster attraction from the  Heartland Theme Park , owned by  Captain Corn . There, people dressed like fruits and vegetables conduce the people to their corn wagons, and then they start rolling inside a cave.
 Captain Corn uses this attraction to hunt " Numbers ". He identify  Numbers Holders  with a special camera, and when they visit his attraction, he splits the holder's wagon from the others, causing it to take a different route that leads to Captain Corn. He then  Duels  the Numbers Holders and defeats them to obtain their "Numbers". As a last resort, if Captain Corn thinks he can't win the Duel, he has access to a lever which changes the track of the attraction's rails, leading the wagons to an abyss; by that way, he can threat his opponent so that he loses on purpose, otherwise the other customers would fall in the abyss.
