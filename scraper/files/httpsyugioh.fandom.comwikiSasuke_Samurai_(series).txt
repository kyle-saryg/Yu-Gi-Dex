 Playing style 
 The series does not have a particular playing style. " Sasuke Samurai " and " Sasuke Samurai 4 " both focus on destroying the opponent's monsters. " Sasuke Samurai 2 " focuses on stopping the opponent's Spell and Trap Cards from activating, which is somewhat field control. The effect of " Sasuke Samurai 3 " forces the opponent to draw cards whenever it inflicts battle damage, causing some Deck destruction.
