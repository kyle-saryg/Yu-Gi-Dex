 Biography 
 Rick was first seen at the very beginning of the  KC Grand Championship . He engaged in a Duel against  KC DuelTek 760 , but because of a mysterious hacker (who later turned out to be  Zigfried von Schroeder ) he unwillingly had to face KC DuelTek 760 on its highest and most dangerous level. Luckily  Yugi , who was close by, jumped in and took over the Duel and eventually won because of combining the effect of Rick's " Spirit Ryu " and " Heart of the Underdog ", a card he gave to Rick shortly before the Duel. Afterwords, Yugi told Rick to balance his Deck more.
 
 Deck 
 Rick's Deck mostly consists of  Dragon -type monster cards and lacks a good balance of  Magic ,  Trap  and  Monster Cards , with the only shown Magic and Trap Cards being " Dragon Treasure " and " Heart of the Underdog ".
