 Summary 
   This summary is currently incomplete. 
 As a  rider  and his  passenger  are patroling a highway on a  Duel Runner   in search of memories to shatter,  Yuzu  and her  father  are flabbergasted over  Yuya  admitting to have three personalities along with his own. While Syuzo admits Yuya is starting to creep him out, Yuzu considers the financial gain it might present for  Syu Zo Duel School . Yuya admits he has no idea how he got his three other personalities due to a bit of memory loss,  Yuto  keeping Yuya in the dark about their counterparts' actions. Yuzu then remembers the G.O.D. card Yuya mentioned earlier and asks if it has anything to do with Yuya's mental state. Yuya proceeds to explain that  Genesis Omega Dragon  is a Duel Monster whose power could be used in the wrong hands to destroy the world, explaining it can realize anything made with  Solid Vision . But Yuya changes the subject to something he concerned more important: not wanting to be involved in Yuzu's embarrassing sales pitches for her father's Duel School. But Yuzu does not Yuya leave her side easily, deciding to move in with him to both his dismay and her father's dismay to ensure the safety of the Duel School.
 The next day, overwhelmed by his curiosity over  Reiji 's obsession with Yuya,  Sora  decides to access Leo Corp's supercomputer for answers. But Reiji was a step ahead of Sora, telling the boy that the computer predicted Yuya as someone who will destroy the world. When Sora asks questions considering the mysterious circumstances of his sudden appearance and establishment of Leo Corp, Reiji advises the boy to get further answers from Yuya. Reiji then leaves Sora with some  prototype cards  while giving him a hint about Yuya's quarry. When Yuya is alerted to a possible G.O.D. card sighting, he and Yuto are forced to take Yuzu with them as they don disguises to sneak into an office building. Once inside, Yuto and Yuzu reach a duel system laboratory where Sora is waiting for them as they are all locked in.
