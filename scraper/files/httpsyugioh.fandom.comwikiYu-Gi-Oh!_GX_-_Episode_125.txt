 Summary 
 The  Duels  between  Jesse Anderson ,  Jim Crocodile Cook  and  Axel Brodie  against the  Three Masked Knights  continue, with both the food storage facility and power supply station on the line.  Vice Chancellor Bonaparte  attempts to sneak back into  Duel Academy , but is spotted by  Blair Flannigan , who informs  Jaden Yuki . The two of them chase after him, as they realize he would be a very strong opponent if he was turned into a  Duel Ghoul .
 Axel wins his Duel quickly, and determines that these Duels means nothing and that they are only meant to serve as a distraction as  Marcel Bonaparte  moves towards his true goal. He urges Jim and Jesse to surrender, so they can save time and go after Marcel. Impassivity Mask stops Jesse from leaving with a strange beam fired from his duel disk, while Jim is stopped from surrendering by the angry students, who want the food Marcel promised them if they win. Axel leaves and gathers the  Blue Berets  together, heading towards the power supply station.
 Jim and Jesse win their own Duels with some difficulty, Jesse finishing last despite his early lead. Bonaparte reaches Marcel, followed by Jaden and Blair. When Jaden tries to drag Marcel back, Bonaparte reveals that Marcel is his son and vows not to let Jaden harm him. Marcel reveals the  Devil Arm  from under his cloak and suggests that they leave. A large group of  Duel Ghouls  emerges behind them from over the sands. Marcel uses the Devil Arm to punch through the sand, and a deep fissure forms as the pillars surrounding  the area  where the  Sacred Beasts  were sealed rise from the sands.
