 Duel Arena Card Images 
 Should we add/upload DAR card images to wiki?  Elvin Kara  ( talk  •  contribs ) 09:15, July 9, 2014 (UTC)
 
 Yeah,  User:Dark Ace SP  has already started. -- UltimateKuriboh  ( talk  •  contribs ) 09:24, July 9, 2014 (UTC) 
 Thanks, one more question, why we not upload DAR sets?  Elvin Kara  ( talk  •  contribs ) 09:28, July 9, 2014 (UTC) 
 We do want the pack images, and we want articles for the DAR-specific sets, but I don't know about the others, since they (should) duplicate their original RL sets.  「 ディノ 奴 千？！ 」 ?  ·  ☎ Dinoguy1000  12:56, July 9, 2014 (UTC)
