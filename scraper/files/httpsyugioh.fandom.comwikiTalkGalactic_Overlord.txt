 Mod is adding fake info and speculation 
 The mod of this page is adding a ton of speculated cards with no confirmation, as well as other cards that are a straight up lie (puripriest, flippertang, etc.) —This unsigned comment was made by  71.32.91.101  ( talk  •  contribs ) 21:18, January 11, 2012 
 
 Pages do not have mods. The wiki itself has  admins . If there are fake cards being added, post them here. I will remove them since the page is still locked to unregistered users.  Cheesedude  ( talk  •  contribs ) 21:31, January 12, 2012 (UTC) 
 I listed the cards that aren't in it and someone deleted what I said  —This unsigned comment was made by  67.42.81.183  ( talk  •  contribs ) 03:57, January 15, 2012 
 
 Articles about upcoming booster packs generally don't need information about what  won't  be in them - that's irrelevant.  Lord Grammaticus  ( talk  •  contribs ) 04:03, January 15, 2012 (UTC) 
 He means on the talk page. He did list them when this page was created. Fredcat deleted it, though given that it was all lower-case text and below the default talk page loadout, he may have missed it and thought it was spam. That being, said, I'll remove the cards.  Cheesedude  ( talk  •  contribs ) 04:07, January 15, 2012 (UTC) 
 Ah, misunderstood. My apologies.  Lord Grammaticus  ( talk  •  contribs ) 05:26, January 15, 2012 (UTC) 
 For the reason why I delete them is because they do sound like spamming and not related to the discussion article of how to improve it; they are most likely to question of how they work (which must be belong to Forum). Also they have no proof whenever they upload the list of cards. It's very important to have an official source from official sites, included Konami's, to prove it they are in. They have done that over and over again, learned nothing from that kind of mistake. -- F r e d C a t  12:36, January 15, 2012 (UTC) 
 puripriest was removed and the number 1 card is in its place (is number 2).
 nevermind...
 
I was just listing the cards on here that are on the page, but have no proof or confirmation  —This unsigned comment was made by  67.42.86.118  ( talk  •  contribs )  
 
 GAOV-JP008 
 Why is there just a link to the card, without listing it's name? Also, in the card, it does not say it is released in GAOV. Is this card confirmed for this set? If yes, the name should be added here and the set on the card's page (and also it seems to be a card used by Tokunosuke, then on this page, it should be added as well "Flip" where it says "Includes cards used by...").

 snow plow engine 
 the card was never confirmed for the set, and is mere speculation
 
 That's true. Is there any source? If not, I'll remove it. And by the way, please sign your posts here.  LegenaryAsariUgetsu  ( talk  •  contribs ) January 23rd, 2012, 12:51 (UTC) 
 Pack name 
 Should it be noted on the page that, at some point  this  said Galactic Overload instead of Galactic Overlord? 
 - Falzar FZ - ( talk page | useful stuff )  23:42, January 23, 2012 (UTC)
 
 I don't see any reason not to... A screenshot of the page when it said that would be cool, but I doubt anyone has one.  「 ディノ 奴 千？！ 」 ?  ·  ☎ Dinoguy1000  00:57, January 25, 2012 (UTC)

 This.  - Falzar FZ - ( talk page | useful stuff )  01:24, January 25, 2012 (UTC) 
 Ooh, works for me. Now to think of a good way to work it into the article...  「 ディノ 奴 千？！ 」 ?  ·  ☎ Dinoguy1000  01:55, January 25, 2012 (UTC) 
 That's exactly why I haven't added yet.

 Some of the cards scanned had some printing errorson it, I noticed.  UltraSynchron  ( talk  •  contribs ) 11:19, February 18, 2012 (UTC)
 
 
 TCG 
 This pack comes out in English in a week from the day this topic was added. Isn't it about time they start revealing the sneak preview card or any of the TCG exclusives? Those are usually spoiled in Konami magazines right? Is this month slow or am I just getting angsty because of these awesome new cards?-- Dragonking  ( talk  •  contribs ) 22:42, March 1, 2012 (UTC)
 March is May now? -- Golden Key  ( talk  •  contribs ) 22:45, March 1, 2012 (UTC)
 Do you have a calendar or something?
 My mistake, my monitor displayed the month as "Ma". forget it.-- Dragonking  ( talk  •  contribs ) 09:37, March 2, 2012 (UTC)
 
 Yugi Muto and Bandit Keith? 
 The section for the TCG version of this set says it includes cards used by Yugi Muto and Bandit Keith. Were is the source for this, and what cards would those be if there is a valid source?  TeeWhyGeeOh  ( talk  •  contribs ) 19:18, March 13, 2012 (UTC)
 
 Massive Size of Images 
 I just noticed that this article has two quite huge image of pack and box, any way to reduce it to good ole' normal size that we used to see before? -- F r e d C a t  19:33, March 14, 2012 (UTC)
 
 New TCG names 
 can some users help renaming the known cards that are shown in  this website ?  LastMinute  ( talk  •  contribs ) 23:02, March 15, 2012 (UTC)
 
 WDC Xyz's? 
 I'm thinking that since Drill Jumbo and Rocket Train are both used by WDC participants, maybe Doboku Zaku and Gustaph Max might be in the OCG Exclusive. Anyone have an opinion?
 
 TCG Names? 
 Where have all of the TCG names for the anime cards (bar Big Eye and Lucky Stripe) been coming from?  TheScarecrow14  ( talk  •  contribs ) 09:57, April 7, 2012 (UTC)
 The Most Likely Yugi card to be in this set is " Slifer the Sky Dragon ". others include " Horn Imp ", " Griffore ", " Torike ", or " Zombie Warrior ". As for Bandit Keith, " Ancient Tool ", " Giganto " and " Saber Slasher " are the only Untranslated Cards he Used, aside from the Alternate Art for " Pendulum Machine ". (Note: i am only taking into account the Cards that are available in the OCG, but not the TCG)
~~Lord Kira 623 04/08/12~~
 Can't believe that no one has noticed that the Bouncers have been renamed Bounzers for the TCG on the main Yugioh website >.>-- The FireFALL  ( talk  •  contribs ) 03:16, April 9, 2012 (UTC)
 
 We've  noticed . We're just waiting until we have the official names for each individual monster before we change their pages. -- Golden Key  ( talk  •  contribs ) 04:08, April 9, 2012 (UTC) 
 Someone please lock this page. 
 Some anon keeps adding nonsense to it. Shouldn't it be locked since it's an upcoming set anyways? -->  Summoned Skull 2:   Electric Boogaloo   04:44, April 10, 2012 (UTC)
 
 Full Card List 
 When are they going to announce all of the cards in this pack?
 Bvalin  ( talk  •  contribs ) 01:59, April 20, 2012 (UTC)
 
 Usually the card list is released or discovered by this Wikia about 4 days before the set is released. The information is kept under wraps by Konami in order to evaluate if the cards will cause a problem and make different cards if they will so the list is always highly secret. That is why everything on these pages are sourced when they are added. Each potential card still could be released somewhere completely different. -- LordGeovanni -  ( Talk To Me ) *Kupo*  02:24, April 20, 2012 (UTC) 
 Yugi and bandith? 
 Source? i can only guess vainillas, but i need sources. -- Yes, im Pato  ( talk  •  contribs ) 23:30, April 20, 2012 (UTC)
 
 I bet that's other bunch of missing cards that should released age ago, like " Multiply " for explain. -- F r e d C a t  23:37, April 20, 2012 (UTC)
 That was released in 2009. It is literally impossible to include a reprint in a 100 card set. The only cards that are missing are vainillas, and i don't see a source so that should be erased. -- Yes, im Pato  ( talk  •  contribs ) 23:42, April 20, 2012 (UTC) 
 Card rarities? 
 I see a bunch of unconfirmed card rarities here.  Like Card Car-D, Night Beam((?) Have we even gotten a tcg name?), Xyz Unit, etc.
 Can anyone confirm these?
 No, I don't think they can be confirmed, but I person on the Pojo forums in the know specified these rarities. I could go into a lengthily explanation, but basically treat these as educated speculations.
 That's _ _ to take that post as fact. If he had a Cardcar D, why wouldnt he post a picture?
 
 Don't curse. And sign your posts. Some people are just lazy about scanning a card. It doesn't mean that they are wrong, but it doesn't mean that they are right either. -- LordGeovanni -  ( Talk To Me ) *Kupo*  06:07, April 26, 2012 (UTC) 
 Imports 
 Before anyone asks, this  [1]  is the setlist and where the knowledge on the imports came from.
 
 Ancient Dragon 
 We know nothing about the card except that its name is "Ancient Dragon." That is a very generic name and there is no reason why it has to be the same random ass card that was seen in a random episode of Yu-Gi-Oh! several years ago. Stop adding the link. Wikia is already known for hosting vandalism, and we don't need to advertise more potentially incorrect information.-- YamiWheeler  ( talk  •  contribs ) 19:34, April 26, 2012 (UTC) 
 Like what Joey said, we have Yugi included the list that most of his cards were already printed into OCG/TCG - with some random Vanilla Monsters remains to be releasing - so that would be an issue; which is same for "random ass card" - " Ancient Dragon "... to me, it's pathetic motive... Nexus need to show a proof (as always) of the reason why it is exist in Galactic Overlord... -- i F r e d C a t  19:37, April 26, 2012 (UTC) 
 A card in  Galactic Overlord   is  confirmed to be "Ancient Dragon", but we don't know anything about it besides that. People are just jumping to stupid conclusions.-- YamiWheeler  ( talk  •  contribs ) 19:39, April 26, 2012 (UTC) 
 You're saying that it's confirmed to be complete different version of "Ancient Dragon", not same one from Duel Monster show? -- i F r e d C a t  19:54, April 26, 2012 (UTC) 
 No, like I said, we don't know anything about it besides the name, hence why I think it'd be incorrect to link to that article.-- YamiWheeler  ( talk  •  contribs ) 19:57, April 26, 2012 (UTC) 
 From a youtube video  [2] -- X-Metaman  ( talk  •  contribs ) 21:24, April 26, 2012 (UTC) 
 Can you link to the video? cause i saw a Link, but that wanst't the video. I saw the images, i just need to know where they come from. -- Yes, im Pato  ( talk  •  contribs ) 22:37, April 27, 2012 (UTC)
