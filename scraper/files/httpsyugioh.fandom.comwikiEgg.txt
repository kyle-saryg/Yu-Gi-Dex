 Notes 
 
 ↑   While most of the cards in this archetype have the full term 「エッグ」 ( Eggu ) in their Japanese names, " Ryu-Ran " and " Manga Ryu-Ran " instead have 「エッガー」 ( Eggā ), hence the Japanese name 「エッ」. Because 「エッ」 ends with a  sokuon , and there is no standard way to romanize an ending sokuon, the romanization  E—  is used.
