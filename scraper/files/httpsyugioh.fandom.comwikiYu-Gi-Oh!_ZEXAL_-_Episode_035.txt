 "Bad Developments: Part 1" , known as  "The Shocking Scoop! Kotori's Dangerous Future"  in the Japanese version, is the thirty-fifth episode of the  Yu-Gi-Oh! ZEXAL  anime. It first aired in Japan on December 12, 2011, and in the United States on October 27, 2012.
 After Yuma laments over  Shark  dueling in revenge against  Quattro , he's irritated by everything that's going on and ends up getting into a squabble with  Tori . Meanwhile, elsewhere in the tournament, a photographer named  Cameron  has won Duel after Duel against  Duelists  with the help of terrifying ability of his that leaves them in terror. Cameron's superpower is apparently a gift to be able to take photographs of the future. With Cameron's "Future Photographs", his opponent's entire strategy is laid bare before him, allowing him to relentlessly defeat Duelists.
 Yuma is told by his older sister  Kari  to get the scoop on what's up with this Cameron guy, when he sees one of the photographs. The photograph that Cameron takes shows Tori being dragged into a major disaster. In order to prevent this dangerous future from coming to pass,  Yuma  challenges Cameron, whose mind is under the sway of a " Number "!
