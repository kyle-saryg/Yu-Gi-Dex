      The Original Dimension's City.     
 The  Original Dimension , dubbed by  Leo Akaba  as "the world that no longer exists" [1] , also known as the  United World  ( 一 つの 世 界   Hitotsu no Sekai ), is a dimension that became split into  Four Dimensions .
 A colorful and futuristic city, it has hovering vehicles and virtual birds while sharing many general similarities to the  Fusion ,  Synchro ,  Xyz  and  Standard Dimension 's architectural structures. It is also the birth place of the  ARC System  technology. [1] 
 At some point, much of it was destroyed by  Z-ARC  using his fused Dragon form. At a later point,  Ray Akaba  opposed the Supreme King Z-ARC by using  four cards  to defeat him which caused them and the Dimension to split into four. [2]

 Trivia 
 Though the exact time that the world ceased to exist wasn't stated in the story, it can be presumed that it is at least 14 years before the story based on the age of  Dimensional counterparts . However, Leo Akaba's new family contradicts this as Declan Akaba is 16 years old as well as the flashback of Yusho and Yoko's meeting. One possibility suggests that perhaps Leo had already began his new family with Henrietta in the Original Dimension as did Yuya's parents relationship and were all placed in the Standard Dimension with the memories of the previous world being altered and omitted as was the case with Leo.
 Additionally, it's possible Declan was a replacement for Ray to fill the void in Leo's family; sort of the universe's way to fix mistakes. 
 The Original Dimension is likely a world where all traces of the past series took place which including all the summoning methods of Fusion, Synchro, and Xyz Summon, setting it some time after the events of  Yu-Gi-Oh! ZEXAL  and before it split into four dimensions in  Yu-Gi-Oh! ARC-V .
