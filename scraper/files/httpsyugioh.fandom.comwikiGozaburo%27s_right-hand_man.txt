 Biography 
       Confronting  Seto  over  Gozaburo 's death.     
 The man served as Gozaburo's right-hand man. Gozaburo's son,  Seto , forcefully took over the company, driving Gozaburo to commit suicide. Afterwhich, he stripped Gozaburo's right-hand man of his authority. The circumstances of Gozaburo's death were covered-up and Seto was said to have inherited the company, but the former right-hand man was aware of what really happened and tried to expose Seto.
 He appeared at the  grand opening  of the first  Kaiba Land , where he accused Kaiba of taking over the company and driving his father to his suicide. He called Kaiba the "devil incarnate". Seto had the security guards remove him. Seto then informed  Yugi Mutou  of that man's former position and said that he is now a worthless has-been, before giving Yugi a cover story of his father's death.
