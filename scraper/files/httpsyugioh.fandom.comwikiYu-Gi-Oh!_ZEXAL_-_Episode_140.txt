Then, Don Thousand  Summons  the terrifying  monster  " Numeronius " which has 10000  ATK , and places the whole world in the mercy of his grasp! In order to escape from this horrifying dilemma, Yuma and  Astral  combine into  ZEXAL , frantically pulling all the stops offensively and defensively! And in the middle of this struggle, the true origin of the " Numbers ", which has been shrouded in mystery, is finally revealed...

 Summary 
 As he grasps the card  Eliphas  gave him,  Astral  informs  Yuma  and  Nash  that Eliphas told him something - he is entrusting the future to them. He insists that that's why they cannot cry now - they carry the hopes, thoughts and wishes of their countless friends and allies. He urges them both to win this  Duel  no matter what it takes (in the dub, Astral declares that their victory is close).  Don Thousand  asks if they really believe victory is possible just because they  destroyed  " Numeron Network " and gained some  Life Points . He  draws  and reminds them that his  banished  " Chaos Number 1: Numeron Chaos Gate Sunya "  returns  to the  field  now.  Tori  gasps as the gate rises up behind Thousand once more. Nash points out that "Numeron Network" is no longer on the field, so "Sunya" destroys itself. 
 
       " Number C1000: Numeronius " emerges.     
 As the gate explodes, Yuma adds that that means they won't be hit by 50,000  damage  either. Thousand calls them fools and says that this a "Duel of the gods" - all roads here will lead mortals to despair (in the dub, Thousand reminds Yuma and Nash they are Dueling against a deity; he prepared for any possible outcome beforehand). He  activates  " Numeron Chaos Ritual " as "Sunya" was destroyed. This lets him treat "Numeron Network" and four " Number "  monsters  in his  Graveyard  as  Level  12 monsters and perform an  Xyz Summon  using them. Five Graveyard portals appear and from them rise "Numeron Network", " Number 1: Numeron Gate Ekam ", " Number 2: Numeron Gate Dve ", " Number 3: Numeron Gate Trini ", and " Number 4: Numeron Gate Catvari ". Thousand  overlays  his five Level 12 monsters and  chants  "The grief of chaos is the karma of wretched men. The dreams of heaven and earth are an eternal fantasy. O hollow god, armed with darkness, swing your iron hammer down upon the light!" (he does not chant in the dub) The  Barian Gate  explodes and he Xyz Summons " Chaos Number 1000: Numeronius " in  Attack Position . Its  ATK  is revealed - at 10,000.
 Yuma stares in awe at "Numeronius", while Nash calls its five-digit ATK score impossible. Tori covers her mouth with both hands and backs away. Thousand claims they can only bend and break before its power and orders it to attack " Chaos Number 101: Silent Honor ARK " as the third eye on his head glows. The eyes of "Numeronius" itself also glow as it appears to charge up a blast. Yuma has no counter and Tori yells his name. Nash asks if Thousand thought he would let this go through. He activates his  face-down  " Tidal Advantage ". When a  WATER  monster  battles , this card will halve the ATK of the attacking monster and prevent the destruction of the WATER monster  by battle . "Numeronius" fires a giant laser, while a whirlwind of water engulfs "Silent Honor DARK" to protect it. Thousand calls Nash a poor loser, but adds that they still take damage - and so will the  Astral World . Yuma, Astral and Nash are all thrown off their feet and their Life Points drop to 1100.
 
       Enna  expresses her belief that the  Astral World  will survive.     
 Bursts of energy rip through the buildings in the Astral city.  Enna  tells one of the Astral children that everything will be alright. She believes Yuma and his friends will win, for the sake of not just the Astral World's future, but everyone's. Yuma grunts in pain and Thousand muses that they survived the attack. He says he'll show them the true power of "Numeronius" now though. When a battle ends, "Numeronius" can destroy all his opponent's monsters. Nash yells "WHAT!?" ("No!" in the dub) as "Silent Honor DARK" explodes after being hit with red energy blasts. Thousand continues, revealing that all monsters that were  sent  to the Graveyard this turn are Special Summoned to  his  field in  Defense Position . "Silent Honor DARK" reappears below "Numeronius" and Thousand ends his turn.
 Nash calls this an absurd effect and isn't sure if they can win. Yuma insists that they haven't lost yet. He remarks that the feelings and future that everyone entrusted to them are in their hearts (in the dub, Yuma tells Nash not to say those words; losing hope is what Thousand wanted. He may have control over their monsters, but not their Dueling spirits) and tells Astral they have to do it now. Astral says he understands and the two overlay themselves, chanting "Mighty bonds lead the way to light". ("When two distant souls become one, the power of ZEXAL is revealed!" in the dub) They perform a  ZEXAL Morph . Tori comments that they've used the first form of ZEXAL (this comment is cut from the dub). Yuma points at Thousand and claims they will crush him with everything they've got. Thousand seems pleased to see ZEXAL appear, but wonders if it will even help (in the dub, Thousand is not impressed with the ZEXAL "theatrics"). Yuma claims they'll win no matter. He raises his right arm and it glows with energy as he chants "The light...the power of everything! They dwell in my right hand, leading the way to hope and dreams!  Shining Draw !" (in the dub, "A truly powerful Duelist can shape the outcome of a Duel and can even generate the very card he needs! Shining Draw!"). 
 
       " Re-Xyz " lets  Yuma   Xyz Summon  from his  Graveyard .     
 He's drawn " Re-Xyz ", which he activates, explaining that it lets him  target  an  Xyz Monster  in his Graveyard and the targets required to Xyz Summon it. He then performs an Xyz Summon from the Graveyard. Ghostly forms of " Gagaga Magician " and " Toy Knight " appear before him, which he overlays to Xyz Summon " Number 39: Utopia " in Attack Position. Thousand activates the effect of "Numeronius",  detaching  a  Chaos Overlay Unit  to destroy an opponent's monster and Special Summon a " C " monster from his opponent's  Extra Deck  in its place. "Numeronius" flaps its wings and the blasts of wind shred apart "Utopia". It is replaced by " Chaos Number 39: Utopia Ray Victory ", who appears in Attack Position. Yuma asks why he'd do this and Thousand reveals that "Numeronius" also  negates  the effects of his opponent's "C" monsters and prevents them from attacking. "Utopia Ray Victory" is encased in a crystal prison and Thousand claims their "Chaos Numbers" are powerless before him. Tori backs away in shock and seems to think it's over. Yuma yells that they've not been beaten yet and an energy bubble appears around him. He claims that burning passion will lead the way to victory (in the dub, Astral chants, "When two hearts join together in the spirit of hope, nothing is impossible!") and when the bubble vanishes, he stands before them in  ZEXAL II  form. Tori cheers, while, Yuma activates " Xyz Treasure ", letting him draw a card for each Xyz Monster on the field, meaning three. He chants "in the the Duel between the strongest Duelists, everything is inevitable! In such a Duel, the Duelist can create the very cards they draw! Triple Shining Draw!" (in the dub, Yuma only says "Shining Draw" but still draws three cards).
 Yuma  Normal Summons  " ZS - Ouroboros Sage ", with Astral explaining that when it's Summoned, they can Special Summon a non- LIGHT  "Number" monster from their Graveyard. "Ouroboros Sage" shoots a yellow blast from its staff, which spirals into the sky, prompting " Number 101: Silent Honor ARK " to descend. He then activates the other effect of "Ouroboros Sage" - he can  equip  a " Utopic " monster and "Ouroboros Sage" itself to the Special Summoned monster, causing the equipped monster to gain their ATKs. "Utopia Ray Victory" stands atop the cockpit of "Silent Honor ARK", with "Ouroboros Sage" standing on the shoulders of "Victory". With 5500 ATK now, Yuma orders "Silent Honor ARK" to attack "Numeronius". Tori asks why, when they still have less ATK. Yuma activates the third effect of "Ouroboros Sage", when the equipped monster attacks, its ATK is doubled. The blast from the staff of "Ouroboros Sage" hits the core of "Silent Honor ARK" and Thousand is shocked to see 11,000 ATK. Yuma yells that this is their combined power and orders the monsters to smash "Numeronius" to pieces with " Rising Sun Ark Victory Slash ". 
 
         "Numeronius" revives the destroyed monsters.     
 "Silent Honor ARK" fires its lasers and "Utopia Ray Victory" leaps in front of the blast, absorbing the energy with its swords before slashing through "Numeronius". Thousand yells as his Life Points fall to 900 and an explosion engulfs his field. Tori jumps up and down cheering. Yuma claims "Numeronius" is scrapped now, but Astral tells him he's wrong. When the smoke clears, "Numeronius" still stands before them. Nash points out that "Silent Honor DARK" isn't there anymore though. Thousand reveals that he used another effect of "Numeronius" - he can send a monster he controls to the Graveyard to prevent its destruction. Yuma is surprised at that effect, but Thousand has another to use now. As the battle ended, "Numeronius" destroys all the opponent's monsters. Then Thousand can Special Summon monsters destroyed this turn to his field in Defense Position. He Special Summons "Silent Honor ARK", "Utopia", "Utopia Ray Victory", and "Silent Honor DARK". Yuma is shocked that ZEXAL failed them and they cancel the fusion.
 
         The first fifty " Numbers " mark the location of the  Numeron Code .     
 Thousand tells them that humans cannot hope to fight against the power of  Chaos . This is because humans themselves are the roots of Chaos. Yuma seems confused, but Thousand explains that the power of Chaos will always revive him. Astral asks if its because he tampered with the memories of the  Seven Barian Emperors . Thousand ignores the question, but instead admits to losing when he and Astral fought eons ago (in the dub, Thousand reminds Yuma there is no way to oppose his limitless powers; even Astral should know this. He adds that Astral thought he won, but there is more to it). He reveals that due to the shock of the battle, Astral's power was split and became fifty of the "Numbers". Those cards scattered across the  human world , marking the location of the  Numeron Code . After that, seven of those "Numbers" helped seal Thousand's power and chose their owners, attaching themselves to various heroes and sages of Earth (shots of  Alito ,  Vector , and  Girag  with their respective  "Mythyrian Numbers"  are shown over this; in the dub, Thousand adds that his power was sealed in the "Mythyrian Numbers" and were sent to the future Barian Emperors; Thousand remained patient to ensure the "Mythyrian Numbers" fell into the right hands). Yuma remarks that those are the "Numbers" from the ruins (in the dub, Yuma realizes that Thousand tricked the Barian Emperors into helping him). Nash says Thousand placed a curse on the ones who held those "Numbers" then. Thousand confirms this and says that to revive himself, he gifted the power of Chaos to those humans, who would then become his fuel.
 Thousand claims that humanity is weak - and due to their weakness, Chaos can consume them easily (scenes of Thousand's curses over  Mizar , Vector, Girag, and Alito are shown over this). Thousand claims that no one was immune - not even someone like Nash's friend  Dumon . Thousand appeared in his reaper form to the three knights who slew Dumon, influencing them into the act. Thousand adds that  Marin  was no exception either and its shown that Thousand influenced her into sacrificing herself during Vector's assault on  her homeland . Nash curses, but Thousand reminds him that Nash himself is guided by his curse. He says he'll soon realize why he was reborn as a  Barian  (in the dub, Thousand claims that Nash was most instrumental in his resurrection). Nash is furious, but Yuma interrupts. He says that while humans may be weak, they can use Chaos in other ways. He calls it a power that lets you live with your friends - a power that can protect others (in the dub, Yuma yells that Thousand can't bring him and Nash down by throwing them off and making them doubt themselves). He adds there's no way they will lose ("This human is bringing him down!" in the dub) and  Sets  four cards to end his turn.
 
         Kite 's spirit appears to Yuma.     
 Thousand is surprised they are still clinging to such a dim hope. He draws and activates " Numeron Storm ". As he  controls  a " Numeronius " monster, he can destroy all of his opponent's  Spell  and  Trap Cards . An electric storm manifests, destroying all four of their Set cards. Thousand says they've lost everything, then, but they will still lose more. He reveals that "Numeron Storm" inflicts 1000 damage to them as well. Their Life Points fall to just 100 and the three of them are thrown backwards quite violently. Tori mutters that their Life Points are only 100 now. Thousand says they have no monsters left and no cards in their hand, or face-down - so it is the time of their destruction now. He orders "Numeronius" to attack  directly . Tori screams Yuma's name and Yuma himself just bows his head as "Numeronius" charges a blast.  Kite 's voice rings out and asks him if he intends to give up, just like that. The field between the Duelists glows and even Thousand seems shocked. Kite's spirit appears from the light and asks Yuma what happened to his " kattobingu " spirit, adding that Yuma must be an idiot to have forgotten it. Yuma yells Kite's name in shock, while Kite tells them he's entrusted everything to them - so they must win. (in the dub, Kite says giving up isn't Yuma's style. He chides Yuma for giving up hope; he can't let a deity push him around like that. He also reminds Yuma he left something for him and he should use it) Yuma mutters Kite's name and his spirit vanishes.
 
         " Number 100: Numeron Dragon " is Summoned.     
 A card appears before Yuma and when when touches it, its text unblurs. Yuma realizes it is the " Number 100: Numeron Dragon " he got from Kite. He knows now that Kite is with them. He tells Astral and Shark they can continue. He activates the effect of "Numeron Dragon". When he has no cards in his hand or on his field and his opponent declares a direct attack, this card can Special Summon itself from his  Extra Deck  in  Defense Position . Yuma chants "the key to the creation of the universe, now open the door of darkness and lead us to the future with your roar" (this chant is not said in the dub). "Numeron Dragon" bursts from the ground and roars, coiling around itself and appearing in Defense Position with 0  DEF . Thousand calls this absurd - lowly, filthy maggots like them should not have been able to awaken the Numeron Dragon. He determines it doesn't matter though and orders "Numeronius" to attack it. Yuma activates the effect of "Numeron Dragon" - any monster that battles it has its ATK reduced to 0. The blast vanishes and Thousand is shocked by the effect (in the dub, he calls the move a "hollow gesture"). He reminds them that at a battle's end, all his opponent's monsters are destroyed. "Numeron Dragon" vanishes. Astral tells Yuma to proceed and he activates the other effect of "Numeron Dragon". When it is destroyed, all of his opponent's monsters are as well. The spirit of "Numeron Dragon" reappears and breaths fire all over Thousand's field, destroying all his monsters. Yuma says he has nothing left now and reveals that "Numeron Dragon" now returns all Spell & Trap Cards destroyed this turn to their previous position. "Numeron Dragon" vanishes and the four Set cards reappear. Yuma claims their ray of hope has not yet vanished.
 Thousand calls them fools. No matter what they do, they simply open another door to despair. Thousand reveals that when "Numeronius" is destroyed, he can make it an Overlay Unit and overlay it. He yells out " Extermination Chaos Xyz Evolution " (in the dub, Thousand doesn't mention the Chaos Xyz Evolution), raising his fist. Multicolored energy flows around as he chants "My heaven is vast; my earth is ancient. The dreams that men cling to are a mere illusion. O almighty god of void and nothingness, armed with the darkness, swing down your iron hammer upon the light!" (omitted from the dub), Xyz Summoning " Chaos imaginary Number 1000: Numeronius Numeronia ". As before, its ATK appears - at a terrifying  100,000 .
 Astral remarks at the fact that it is a  Rank  13 "Chaos Number", while Nash dumbfoundedly repeats its six-digit ATK score (in the dub, Astral mentions its ATK, while Nash asks how this is possible). Thousand tells them that while "Numeronia" cannot attack, while it is on the field, his opponent's monsters must attack it, no matter what. And if by some chance they manage not to attack, they will  automatically lose  at the  End Phase . Tori stares up at the monster and believes there is no way they can win now. Thousand laughs and asks if they understand yet - they have no hope left; they never had any hope. 
 
         Yuma remembers his fallen allies.     
 Yuma declares that he refuses to give up - not until the very last second. For the sake of all his friends who have died, but entrusted their hopes and feelings to them, he refuses to give up (Kite,  Trey ,  Quinton ,  Quattro ,  Flip ,  Nistro ,  Dextra ,  Orbital 7 ,  Bronk ,  Anna ,  Nelson ,  Roku ,  Kaze ,  Eliphas ,  Rio , Dumon, Alito, Girag, Mizar, and even Vector appear behind him briefly in spirit). Nash agrees and Astral smiles, saying they'll do this together. They overlay once more, chanting "this blinding ray of hope guides us to the future" (in the dub, "When two kindred spirits unite, their future has no limits! Ultimate ZEXAL Morph!"). They appear now as  ZEXAL III .
 
         Kite's spirit stands with Yuma and  Nash .      Thousand growls and Yuma activates his face-down " Session Draw ". He explains when their next  Draw Phase  occurs, they may draw another card - and if both cards are monsters of the same Level, they can immediately overlay them for an Xyz Summon. Thousand is nonplussed, chiding them for still clinging to hope before ending his turn. Nash moves to draw, as does Yuma via "Session Draw". They simultaneously declare " Chaos Draw " and "Destiny Shining Draw", respectively. Yuma reveals his draw as " Zexal Weapon - Tornado Bringer ", while Nash reveals his as " Panther Shark ". They declare that they will overlay their two Level 5 monsters, as Nash's draw glows with blue energy and Yuma's with green energy. " Number 73: Abyss Splash " is Xyz Summoned in Attack Position. Yuma activates his face-down " Utopia Rising ", which lets him Special Summon "Utopia" from his Graveyard and equip it with this card. Nash activates another of Yuma's face-down cards - " Bonds of Hope ". When an Xyz Monster is Special Summoned to his field, he can Special Summon another Xyz Monster from his Graveyard. He revives "Numeron Dragon" and then reveals that "Bonds of Hope" and all the Overlay Units on their field are  attached  to one Xyz Monster they control. Nash targets "Utopia", saying it now has three Overlay Units. Nash tells Yuma that he entrusts their hopes to him. Yuma reveals that the other effect of "Utopia Rising" allows "Utopia" to use any effects that Xyz Monsters they control have that can be activated by detaching Overlay Units - so it can use the effects of both "Numeron Dragon" and "Abyss Splash". Thousand is shocked as "Utopia" glows with rainbow energy. Tori remarks that those three monsters are the power of Yuma, Shark, and Kite combined. Yuma declares that Thousand will feel all of their hopes and dreams this time (in the dub, he declares that they are taking Thousand down as a team).
 Featured Duel: Yuma Tsukumo and Nash vs. Don Thousand 
 Duel continues from  the previous episode . 
 
         " Numeron Chaos Ritual " lets  Thousand   overlay  his " Numeron " cards.     
 Turn 5: Don Thousand 
Don Thousand draws. During the  Standby Phase , " Chaos Number 1: Numeron Chaos Gate Sunya " is Special Summoned ( 2/2000/1000) from the Banished Zone in Attack Position via its own effect, but without " Numeron Network " on the field, it  destroys  itself through its third effect and it has no  Overlay Units  to  detach  for its effect. As "Numeron Chaos Gate Sunya" was destroyed,  Don Thousand   activates  " Numeron Chaos Ritual " to treat "Numeron Network", " Number 1: Numeron Gate Ekam ", " Number 2: Numeron Gate Dve ", " Number 3: Numeron Gate Trini ", and " Number 4: Numeron Gate Catvari " from his Graveyard and  Banished  Zone as Level 12 monsters for an Xyz Summon. He then  overlays  his five Level 12 monsters in order to Xyz Summon " Chaos Number 1000: Numeronius " ( 12/10000/1000, ORU: 5) in  Attack Position . 
 "Numeronius"  attacks  " Chaos Number 101: Silent Honor ARK ", but  Nash  activates his  face-down  " Tidal Advantage " to halve the ATK of "Numeronius" ("Numeronius": 10000 → 5000 ATK) and prevent WATER monsters from being  destroyed by battle  this  turn  (Yuma & Nash: 3300 → 1100 LP). At the end of the  Battle Phase , the effect of "Tidal Advantage" expires ("Numeronius": 5000 → 10000 ATK). At the same time, the third effect of "Numeronius" destroys all monsters on  Yuma  and Nash's field and revives "Silent Honor DARK" ( 5/2800/1500) in  Defense Position  and under Don Thousand's control.
 Turn 6: Yuma/Astral 
Yuma and  Astral  perform a  ZEXAL Morph . Yuma then performs a  Shining Draw  and gets " Re-Xyz ". Yuma then activates "Re-Xyz" to use " Gagaga Magician " and " Toy Knight " in his Graveyard in order to  Xyz Summon  " Number 39: Utopia " ( 4/2500/2000, ORU: 2) from his Graveyard in Attack Position. Don Thousand activates the final effect of "Numeronius" to detach a  Chaos Overlay Unit  ("Numeronius": 5 → 4 ORU), destroy "Utopia" and Special Summon " Chaos Number 39: Utopia Ray Victory " ( 5/2800/2500) from Yuma's Extra Deck in Attack Position (as it's a " C " monster) with its effects  negated . Don Thousand explains that due to the second effect of "Numeronius", the effects of "C" monsters are negated and they can't attack.
 Yuma and Astral upgrade their ZEXAL Morph to become  ZEXAL II . Yuma then activates " Xyz Treasure " to  draw  three cards (one for each  Xyz Monster  on the field). Yuma performs three Shining Draws while conducting the effect of "Xyz Treasure". Yuma then Normal Summons " Zexal Server - Ouroboros Sage " ( 3/600/0) in Attack Position. He then activates the first effect of "Ouroboros Sage" to revive " Number 101: Silent Honor ARK " ( 4/2100/1000) in Attack Position (as it's a non- LIGHT  "Number" monster).
 
         " Zexal Server - Ouroboros Sage " and " Number C39: Utopia Ray Victory " power up " Number 101: Silent Honor ARK ".     
 Yuma then activates the second effect of "Ouroboros Sage" to  equip  itself and "Utopia Ray Victory" (a " Utopic " monster) to "Silent Honor ARK" and increase the latter's ATK by the combined ATK of the equipped monsters. ("Silent Honor ARK": 2100 → 5500 ATK). "Silent Honor ARK" attacks "Numeronius" and Yuma activates the third effect of "Ouroboros Sage" to double the ATK of "Silent Honor ARK" ("Silent Honor ARK": 5500 → 11000 ATK) until the  End Phase , but Don Thousand activates the fourth effect of "Numeronius" to destroy "Silent Honor DARK" and prevent "Numeronius" from being destroyed (Don Thousand: 1900 → 900 LP). At the end of the Battle Phase, the third effect of "Numeronius" destroys all monsters on Yuma and Nash's field and revives "Utopia" ( 4/2500/2000), "Utopia Ray Victory" ( 5/2800/2500), "Silent Honor ARK" ( 4/2100/1000) and "Silent Honor DARK" ( 5/2800/1500) in Defense Position and all under Don Thousand's control. Yuma  Sets  four cards.
 Turn 7: Don Thousand 
Don Thousand draws " Numeron Storm ". As he controls a " Numeronius " monster, he activates "Numeron Storm" to destroy all cards in Yuma and Nash's  Spell and Trap Card Zones , while also inflicting 1000  damage  to Yuma & Nash (Yuma & Nash: 1100 → 100 LP). "Numeronius" attacks  directly . As Yuma is being attacked directly while he has no cards in his hand and controls no cards, he activates the second effect of " Number 100: Numeron Dragon " in his Extra Deck to Special Summon it ( 1/0/0) in Defense Position. A  replay  occurs and "Numeronius" attacks "Numeron Dragon", but the third effect of "Numeron Dragon" reduces the ATK of "Numeronius" to 0 ("Numeronius": 10000 → 0 ATK), ending the battle in a stalemate. At the end of the Battle Phase, the third effect of "Numeronius" destroys "Numeron Dragon". The fourth effect of "Numeron Dragon" activates (as it was destroyed), destroying all monsters on the field and returning all Spell and Trap Cards that were destroyed this turn to the same location and position they were in before they were destroyed.
 
         " Number iC1000: Numeronius Numeronia " descends.     
 As "Numeronius" was destroyed, Don Thousand activates the second effect of " Chaos imaginary Number 1000: Numeronius Numeronia " from his Extra Deck, Special Summoning the latter monster in Attack Position and attaching "Numeronius" to it as an Overlay Unit ( 13/100000/100000, ORU: 1). Don Thousand explains that "Numeronius Numeronia" cannot attack, but the opponents must attack it if able, and if they do not, they will  automatically lose  during their End Phase. Yuma and Astral perform another ZEXAL Morph, this time into  ZEXAL III . Yuma activates his face-down " Session Draw ", allowing him to draw a card during Nash's next  Draw Phase . Should Nash and Yuma draw monsters with the same Level, Nash can Xyz Summon an Xyz Monster using those two cards only.
 Turn 8: Nash 
 
         Chaos Draw  and  Shining Draw  used together.     
 Nash performs a  Chaos Draw  and gets " Panther Shark ", while Yuma performs a Destiny Shining Draw due to "Session Draw" and gets " Zexal Weapon - Tornado Bringer ". Using the effect of "Session Draw," Nash overlays "Panther Shark" and "Tornado Bringer" in order to Xyz Summon " Number 73: Abyss Splash " ( 5/2400/1400, ORU: 2) in Attack Position. Yuma activates his face-down " Utopia Rising " to revive "Utopia" ( 4/2500/2000) in Attack Position. Due to the second effect of "Utopia Rising", "Utopia" can use the effects of Xyz Monsters that Nash controls if they would be activated by detaching Overlay Units. 
 As an Xyz Monster was Special Summoned to their field, Nash activates Yuma's face-down " Bonds of Hope " to revive "Numeron Dragon" ( 1/0/0) in Attack Position and attach "Bonds of Hope" and the Overlay Units of "Abyss Splash" to "Utopia" ("Abyss Splash": 2 → 0 ORU, "Utopia": 0 → 3 ORU).
 Duel continues in  the next episode.

 Number 64: Ronin Raccoon Sandayu 
 Differences from the preview 
         The red 1000.     
 In the episode preview, a non-Chaos symbol for "Number 1000" was shown in red. This was not present in the episode, and " Number C1000: Numeronius " has not been shown to have a base form. This may have been an error, as Nash in the preview says "Chaos Number 1000" instead of "Number 1000" in reference to the symbol.
 
 Errors 
 In the original Japanese episode, Astral calls " Number iC1000: Numeronius Numeronia " a  Rank  13 "Chaos Number" monster, but it is not a member of the " Number C " archetype. 
 When  Don Thousand  uses the  effect  of " Number C1000: Numeronius " for the second time, his  D-Pad  shows " Number C39: Utopia Ray V " instead of " Chaos Number 39: Utopia Ray Victory ". 
 Thousand states that " Numeron Chaos Ritual " uses monsters in the  Graveyard  to conduct an  Xyz Summon . Despite this, the monsters he used with it were actually  banished  at the time.
