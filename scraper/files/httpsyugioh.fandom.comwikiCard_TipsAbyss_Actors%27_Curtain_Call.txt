 This card can be searched by " A Cat of Ill Omen ", " Trap Trick ", " Lilith, Lady of Lament ", " Abyss Actor - Wild Hope " and " Abyss Script - Rise of the Abyss King ". 
 Use " Temple of the Kings " to activate this card on your turn without having to wait for it to survive your opponent's turn. The only way " Abyss Script "  Spell Cards  other than " Abyss Script - Romantic Terror " can be activated during your opponent's turn is by being destroyed by your opponent's card effects while Set. Even " Abyss Playhouse - Fantastic Theater ", which overwrites your opponent's card effects, cannot guarantee that this card will meet its activation requirement on your opponent's turn, because  your opponent still chooses which card to destroy .
 You can similarly use an " Abyss Actor " monster(s) with " Makyura the Destructor " as  Link Material  at the same time, in order to enable "Makyura's" effect to allow this card to be activated from your hand as long as you already activated an "Abyss Script" card earlier that turn. " Stygian Street Patrol " can help bring both monsters onto the field on the same turn.
