 Lancers vs. Duel Academy students vs. Battle Beast 
 At the start of the Duel, the  Field Spell Card , " Crossover " is  activated , as per the rules of an  Action Duel . It will allow the players to use  Action Cards , but they may only have 1 in their  hand  at a time. The Field Spell Card " Predaprimal Jungle " is also activated.
 The  Lancers  and  Duel Academy  students are free to traverse the field and engage in Duels via  Battle Royal  mode. Unbeknownst to either side, the  Battle Beast  is also hiding in the field. The Duel will continue until only a single participant remains.
 The Battle Beast Duels and defeats  Bernie .
 The Battle Beast Duels  Moon Shadow , who  controls  " Twilight Ninja - Shingetsu " (1500/100) and " Twilight Ninja Nichririn, the Chunin " (2300/1000). "Nichirin"  attacks , but an unknown  effect   destroys  both it and "Shingetsu". Moon Shadow  Sets  a card.
 A unknown amount of time is skipped.  Ted  enters the Duel at this point, taking the 2000  LP  intrusion penalty (Ted: 4000 → 2000). The Battle Beast defeats Ted with " Gladiator Beast Laquari " before cornering Moon Shadow with " Gladiator Beast Gyazarus " and defeating him with both  monsters .
 The Battle Beast confronts  Ethan , who disarms himself by throwing his  Deck  at him, prompting the Battle Beast to  seal him in a card  without Dueling him first.
