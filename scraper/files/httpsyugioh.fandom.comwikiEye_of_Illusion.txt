 Notes 
 
 ↑   In terms of its effect on gameplay, this card applied its effect to " Illusionist Faceless Mage " in  Yu-Gi-Oh!   episode 2: " The Gauntlet is Thrown " . That "Illusionist Faceless Mage" could choose an opponent's monster, then when the opponent next declared an attack with another monster it could take control of the chosen monster until the end of the turn and redirect the attack to it.
