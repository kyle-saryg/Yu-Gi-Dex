      The Four Dimensions. (Click on one of the dimensions to go to its page.)     
 The  Fusion Dimension  ( 融 合 次 元   Yūgō Jigen ) is one of the  Four Dimensions  in the  Yu-Gi-Oh! ARC-V  anime, where nearly all  Duelists  use  Fusion Monsters . [1]  An organization in this dimension,  Duel Academy ,  assaulted  the  Xyz Dimension , using an army of students to defeat the dimension's citizenry [1]  and  turn them into cards , considering the assault a "hunting game". [2]  In the English dub, the residents of this dimension are sometimes referred to as "Fusionites". Alternate versions of  Alexis Rhodes ,  Aster Phoenix , and  Zane Truesdale  exist in this dimension.
 It is known that the Duel Academy's island is not the only location in this dimension. The island is surrounded by sea, which can be traveled through by boats, indicating that there are other areas existing in this world. Seagulls are also seen. [3]   City  also exists in this dimension where Duelists come from before enrolling into Duel Academy. After coming to the Fusion Dimension,  Yusho Sakaki  founded another  You Show Duel School  for Duelists who escaped from Duel Academy. [4] 
 Crystal like objects are shown to be floating in the sky throughout the Dimension. They contain cameras used by  Leo Akaba  and  the Doktor .
 Despite being known as "Fusion Dimension",  Ritual Summon  also exists in this dimension, possibly due to it not being a Summon from the Extra Deck. [4] 
 " Super Polymerization " [5] [6]  and " Ultra Polymerization " [7]   also exists but most people are unaware of it until Yuri used them.
