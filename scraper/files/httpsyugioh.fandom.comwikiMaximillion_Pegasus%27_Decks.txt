Also, Pegasus plays multiple cards that allow him to take  control  of his opponent's monsters, which are often then turned into Toon monsters themselves.

 Specifically for his Duel with  Yugi Muto , Pegasus created the cards " Relinquished ", " Thousand-Eyes Restrict ", " Thousand-Eyes Idol ", and " Dark-Eyes Illusionist ". In his first Duel with Yugi, he plays a test Deck that deals with taking  control  of Yugi's monsters. In Duelist Kingdom, along with his Toon cards, Pegasus' Deck mainly focused on using his opponents' own monsters and card effects against them. Later on, in the anime, his Deck focused only on the "Toon" cards. He also uses some cards, such as " Prophecy ", that allow him to take advantage of his mind reading abilities.
 The cards " Doma the Angel of Silence ", " Happy Lover " and " Mask of Darkness " are not used in any of his Duels, but were seen when  Yami Bakura  held his spontaneous Tarot session with Pegasus. In the English version, Bakura explicitly states that these cards were Pegasus's; however, in the Japanese version, the Deck's owner remains ambiguous, as Bakura only refers to the Tarot Deck as "these cards", so he might have brought them himself.
 In addition, he also once wielded " Blue-Eyes White Dragon " via a stone tablet.

 World Championship 2004 
 In  Yu-Gi-Oh! World Championship 2004 , Pegasus still uses a Toon Deck, modified to accommodate the rulings not present in the anime. He uses several cards which boost his Life Points, in order to balance the many Life Point payments required by his Toon Monsters (1000 for the activation of Toon World, and 500 for every attack made with a Toon). He also uses cards like Nimble Momonga and Change of Heart to gather Tributes for his many high-level monsters, as well as Cyber Jar and Morphing Jar to help him find key cards in his Deck. If he is unable to summon his Toons, he also has Black Illusion Ritual and Relinquished to turn enemy monsters' strength into his own.
 As a Tier 3 opponent, Pegasus is unlocked by defeating all of the Tier 2 duelists at least five times each. The player must also have at least one copy of "Toon Mermaid", "Toon Summoned Skull", "Manga Ryu-Ran", and "Blue-Eyes Toon Dragon" in their Trunk, with none in their Deck. If Pegasus is defeated ten times, the latter restriction is removed.

However, in the  anime  and  manga , "Dragon Capture Jar" had 100 ATK and 200 DEF.
