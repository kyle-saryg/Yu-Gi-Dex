 " Drawing a Foul ", known in Japan as " The Forbidden Ace " is the twelfth episode of the  Yu-Gi-Oh! SEVENS  anime. It aired in Japan on August 22, 2020.
 Gavin  didn't win the second Duel, so now  Yuga  has to face  Roa   in a Duel in order to decide who has ownership over Rush Dueling. As it turns out, there's a possibility that Yuga's Sevens Road Magician is not a legal card! Yuga is now in a pinch, as he would lose the moment he draws Sevens Road...
 
 Featured Duel: Yuga Ohdo vs. Roa Kirishima 
 The Duel is conducted as a  Rush Duel .
 Turn 1: Roa Roa Sets 2 monsters, then Sets 3 cards.
 Turn 2: Yuga Yuga Normal Summons " Spell Archer " (1000/400) and " Stray Familiar " (0/1400), then tributes them to Tribute Summon " Brave of Dawn, Lydacross " (2100/1500). Yuga activates the effect of "Lydacross", shuffling 2  Spellcaster  monsters from his GY to his Deck to Special Summon 2 level 5 or lower Spellcaster monsters from his hand. He shuffles "Spell Archer" and "Stray Familiar" to his Deck and Special Summons " Hilt the Noble Arms Bearer " (1300/500) and " Hydro Magician " (1700/1500) in Attack Position. Yuga activates the effect of "Hilt", letting him increase the ATK of an Attack Position  Warrior  monster he controls by 600. He targets "Lydacross" ("Lydacross": 2100 → 2700 ATK). 
 "Hilt" and "Hydro Magician" attack and destroy Roa's 2 Set monsters, which are revealed to be two copies of " Royal Demon's Groupie " (0/0). "Lydacross" attacks directly, but Roa activates his set " King's Management ", reducing the ATK of "Lydacross" by 500 for each  Fiend  Normal Monster in his GY ("Lydacross": 2700 → 1700 ATK) and allowing Yuga to draw a card. The direct attack continues (Roa: 4000 → 2300 LP).
 At this point, Roa reveals that " Sevens Road Magician " is an  illegal  card due to not being in the Goha card database. Thus, Yuga will be disqualified and automatically lose if he draws it.
 Turn 3: Roa Since Roa has no cards in his hand, he draws five cards. Roa activates his Set Spell " King's Reward ", letting him shuffle 1 Level 1 Fiend Normal monster from his GY to his Deck to destroy 1 face-up Level 6 or lower monster Yuga controls, but for the rest of the turn he cannot declare a direct attack and Yuga draws a card. He shuffles "Royal Demon's Groupie" to his Deck, destroys "Hilt" and Yuga draws " Dark Sorcerer ". Roa activates his second Set "King's Reward", shuffles his second "Royal Demon's Groupie" to his Deck, destroys "Hydro Magician" and Yuga draws " Windcaster Torna ". Roa Normal Summons " Royal Demon's Shout " (1200/0), then Sets 2 cards. 
 Roa activates " Card Destruction ", forcing both players to send all cards in their hand to the GY and draw cards equal to the number of cards they sent to the GY. Roa draws 1 card, while Yuga draws " Recovery Force ", "Stray Familiar" and " Kuribot ". Since he controls a face-up Fiend monster, Roa activates his Set Spell " King's Tax ", decreasing the ATK of 1 monster Yuga controls by 500 for each card in his hand, then sending 1 random card from Yuga's hand to the GY. He targets "Lydacross" ("Lydacross": 2100 → 600 ATK) and Yuga discards "Kuribot". Since Yuga controls a face-up Level 7 or higher monster, Roa activates the effect of "Royal Demon's Shout", letting him send 1 card from his hand to the GY to send 2 cards from Yuga's hand to the GY. "Royal Demon's Shout" attacks and destroys "Lydacross" (Yuga: 4000 → 3400 LP).
 Turn 4: Yuga Since Yuga has no cards in his hand, he draws five cards. Yuga draws " Magical Beast Wolfram ", " Curtain of Sparks ", " Piercing! ", " Sevens Road Witch " and "Sevens Road Magician".
 Duel continues in the next episode .
