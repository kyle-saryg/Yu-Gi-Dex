 "A Dubious Duo" , known as  "Yuma and Kaito - Tag Duel of Souls"  in the Japanese version, is the forty-second episode of the  Yu-Gi-Oh! ZEXAL  anime. It first aired in Japan on February 6, 2012, and in the United States on December 15, 2012. This is the first Yu-Gi-Oh! episode to be dubbed by Konami.
 The Tag Duel of  Yuma  and  Kite  against Quattro and Trey begins! Kite duels essentially on his own, even to the extent of hurting all of his opponents, including Yuma. However, Yuma on his part, defends himself and Kite from  Trey  and  Quattro 's damaging combination. Furthermore, even with " Galaxy-Eyes Photon Dragon " being Summoned, it falls victim to Quattro and Trey's trap.

 Summary 
 
 This section  may require  cleanup  to meet this wiki's standards.   You can help out by re-organizing or re-writing parts of it or checking grammar and spelling.   
 Vetrix 's ritual to steal  Hart 's powers continues.  Quinton  guards them, while watching the  Tag Duel  between  Kite Tenjo  and  Yuma Tsukumo  versus  Quattro  and  Trey  with a screen in front of him (this is cut from the dub).
 Quattro taunts Kite and Yuma, Yuma reacts to him, but  Astral  warns him to be careful with Quattro.  Orbital 7 , standing next to  Tori Meadows , shouts to Yuma that he shouldn't hinder Kite. Tori gets angry at Orbital, making him show some fear of her.
 Quattro takes the first turn of the Duel, playing " Egg Head ". Using its effect, he deals Kite 800 points of damage. Yuma asks Kite if he's okay after taking the blast, but Kite replies he should mind his own business and worry about himself. Quattro then dramatically wonders how Hart is doing, to which Kite begins his turn.
 
       Trey  and  Quattro  taking  effect.     
Kite starts brutally, activating his  Field Spell , " Photon World ". The surrounding area starts changing into a space void, probably resembling being on one of the asteroids that form the rings of Planet Saturn. Trey seems surprised, Quattro is still grinning, and Yuma is completely baffled. The latter, just like before, in Trey's Field Spell during the duel against Shark, thinks he's choking, being in a place where humans can't breathe, only to be reminded it's AR Vision by Astral. Kite continues his assault by playing a " Photon " monster, triggering the Field Spell, dealing 400 damage to everyone without a Photon monster.        Tori  shaking  Orbital 7  in frustration.     Yuma gets angry at Kite because of this, since he doesn't have any, meaning he would damage his own Tag Partner. Kite stays cool about it, saying he doesn't need Yuma's power. Meteorites rain down from above the foursome, and crash into Yuma, Quattro, and Trey. Tori shakes Orbital around in frustration.
 Yuma gets upset about Kite damaging him, but Astral reminds him that they're here to save Hart. Quattro starts taunting Kite again, this time mentioning  Dr. Faker  and  Mr. Heartland , and Kite's goal. Yuma flashes back to what Kite said after their last duel about selling his own soul to the devil for his brother, and puts the pieces together. Kite however stays calm and talks it off. Yuma thinks about helping Hart with their Numbers, but Astral reminds him he should focus on the Duel first.
 
         " Number 33 " is  Summoned .     
 Trey takes his turn, having remained quiet during the other turns. He tells Quattro he's about to prepare the combo they've previously planned. He plays " Chronomaly Golden Jet " and " Chronomaly Moai ", allowing him to Xyz Summon his real " Number " monster, " Number 33: Chronomaly Machu Mech ". A purple Number-style 33 appears, and a giant city descends. 
 Yuma gazes at the huge Number in front of him, and Astral calmly shares his thoughts upon the structure with him. Yuma starts his turn, summoning " Ganbara Knight " followed by " Kagetokage ". He then creates an  Overlay Network . Quattro, albeit sarcastic, says he's surprised seeing the opponent summon an Xyz Monster in the first turn. Yuma  Xyz Summons  his own Number, " Number 39: Utopia ". This time, Quattro is honestly surprised, along with Trey, seeing Yuma has a Number, and Quinton, who's watching, also gets interested. Even though Trey sees this as an extra reason for careful preparation, Quattro just bursts into laughter saying the battle just got more interesting.
 Quattro draws and immediately continues his play by doubling his "Egg Head's" level to 8 through " Level Doubler ", and reviving his other Puppet after banishing another.  Overlaying  them, Quattro calls forth his Number, " Number 15: Gimmick Puppet Giant Grinder ". Tori flashes back to when the Number devoured  Bronk  and  Caswell 's " Tin Archduke " and " Antidote Nurse ", remembering the devastating effect of the creature against Xyz Monsters. Trey activates his  Continuous Trap Card , " Number Wall ". Astral and Yuma are surprised by Trey pulling out a Number-specific support card. Quattro activates the effect of "Number 15", destroying "Utopia" and dealing Yuma 2500 points of damage, but he was ready and restores his Life Points through " Damage Mage ". In order to make up for his failure in dealing damage to Yuma, Quattro activates a Spell and intends on using its powers with the effect of "Giant Grinder" to only be destroyed in battle by Numbers, to get rid of " Photon Crusher " and take 2000 Life Points out of Kite. Kite is blown away, but it is revealed to have been saved by Yuma's Trap Card. However, Kite isn't the least bit grateful. Tori expresses she thinks Kite could at least have been a little more grateful, and Orbital apologizes to her. Kite tells Yuma to not help him and that anyone who possesses numbers is an enemy to him. However, he asks Yuma if it was Astral's plan to protect him, but Yuma responds it was his own choice to do so, and that he wants to help Hart, in order to fulfill the promise that Yuma made to him. Quattro however tells Yuma to shut up, angry at Yuma nullifying the effects of his moves and, with that, nullifying his "fan service" (in the dub, Quattro is angry because he lost attention from Yuma and Kite).
 
         " Galaxy-Eyes " surrounded by " Stonehenge Shield ".     
 Seeing how he was unable to inflict pain to any of his opponents, Quattro decides to pop up a screen of Hart's condition, who's being drained of his power at the moment. Kite gets angered, and Quattro, playing right into his anger, says he probably wants his brother to hurry and save him. Trey expresses some sorrow, seemingly not fine with his brother's tactic. Quattro laughs about Kite's anger, but Kite doesn't see the fun in Quattro's "joke" and begins his turn, playing his 2100 ATK " Photon Thrasher ", which triggers "Photon Pressure World," damaging the other 3 for 400 each. He  Tributes  "Thrasher" and "Crusher", and calls " Galaxy-Eyes Photon Dragon " in his anger. The field deals damage again, and "Galaxy-Eyes" attacks "Number 15". However, Quattro shouts that Kite fell for it, as Trey activates his face-down " Stonehenge Shield ", trapping "Galaxy-Eyes", and reducing it's ATK to 0. The effect of "Number 33" activates, dealing damage to Kite equal to the amount of ATK "Galaxy-Eyes" lost, sending 3000 points to Kite.
 
 Featured Duel: Yuma Tsukumo and Kite Tenjo vs Trey and Quattro 
 Turn 1: Quattro 
 Quattro  draws " Gimmick Puppet Egg Head " and subsequently Normal Summons it ( 4/1600/1200) in Attack Position. He then  activates  its  effect  to send " Gimmick Puppet Dreary Doll " from his  hand  to the  Graveyard  and inflict 800  damage  to  Kite  (Kite: 4000 → 3200 LP). Quattro  Sets  a card.
 Turn 2: Kite 
Kite draws " Photon World " and subsequently activates it. Now, each time a " Photon "  monster  is Normal or  Special Summoned , Kite can inflict damage to all players who do not  control  a "Photon" monster equal to the Summoned monster's  Level  times 100. Kite Normal Summons " Photon Crusher " ( 4/2000/0) in  Attack Position  and subsequently activates the effect of "Photon World" (Yuma, Trey and Quattro: 4000 → 3600 LP). Kite Sets a card.
 Turn 3: Trey 
 
                 No. 33 OOPArts Super Weapon - Machu Mach   The Summoning of " Number 33: Chronomaly Machu Mech "     
 Trey draws " Chronomaly Golden Jet " and subsequently Normal Summons it ( 4/1300/1400) in Attack Position. He then activates " Chronomaly Resonance " to Special Summon " Chronomaly Moai " ( 5/1800/1600) in Attack Position (as "Chronomaly Moai" is a "Chronomaly" monster that is one Level higher than "Chronomaly Golden Jet"). 
 Trey activates the effect of "Chronomaly Golden Jet" to increase its Level by one ("Chronomaly Golden Jet":   4 → 5). Trey  overlays  "Chronomaly Golden Jet" and "Chronomaly Moai" in order to  Xyz Summon  " Number 33: Chronomaly Machu Mech " ( 5/2400/1500; ORU: 2) in Attack Position. Trey Sets two cards.
 Turn 4: Yuma 
Yuma draws " Ganbara Knight " and subsequently Normal Summons it ( 4/0/1800) in Attack Position. As he Normal Summoned a Level 4 monster, Yuma Special Summons " Kagetokage " ( 4/1100/1500) in Attack Position via its own effect. Yuma overlays "Ganbara Knight" and "Kagetokage" in order to Xyz Summon " Number 39: Utopia " ( 4/2500/2000; ORU: 2) in Attack Position. Yuma Sets two cards.
 Turn 5: Quattro 
Quattro draws. He then activates " Level Doubler " to target "Gimmick Puppet Egg Head" and double its Level by sending "Gimmick Puppet Dreary Doll" from his hand to the Graveyard ("Gimmick Puppet Egg Head":   4 → 8). Quattro then activates the effect of "Gimmick Puppet Dreary Doll" to  banish  one "Gimmick Puppet Dreary Doll" from his Graveyard and revive the other "Gimmick Puppet Dreary Doll" ( 8/0/0) in Attack Position. Quattro then overlays "Gimmick Puppet Egg Head" and "Gimmick Puppet Dreary Doll" in order to Xyz Summon " Number 15: Gimmick Puppet Giant Grinder " ( 8/1500/2500; ORU: 2) in Attack Position. Trey activates his  face-down  " Number Wall ", which will prevent " Number " monsters he controls from being  destroyed  by card effects. 
 Quattro activates the effect of "Gimmick Puppet Giant Grinder",  detaching  an  Overlay Unit  ("Gimmick Puppet Giant Grinder": 2 → 1 ORU) in order to destroy all other  Xyz Monsters  on the  field  and inflict damage to their  controllers  equal to their respective  ATK . "Utopia" is destroyed (Yuma: 3600 → 1100 LP), but "Chronomaly Machu Mech" is not. As Yuma took damage from a card effect, he activates the effect of " Damage Mage " to Special Summon it ( 3/600/1200) in  Defense Position  and increase his  Life Points  by the damage he took (Yuma: 1100 → 3600 LP). 
 Quattro activates " Attack Gimmick " to increase the ATK of "Gimmick Puppet Giant Grinder" by 500 ("Gimmick Puppet Giant Grinder": 1500 → 2000 ATK). Also, should "Gimmick Puppet Giant Grinder" destroy a monster  by battle , it will inflict damage to the monster's controller equal to the ATK of the destroyed monster. "Gimmick Puppet Giant Grinder" attacks "Photon Crusher" (Quattro intends only for "Photon Crusher" to be destroyed in battle due to the first effect of "Gimmick Puppet Giant Grinder"), but Yuma activates his  face-down  " Impenetrable Attack " to reduce the  battle damage  to 0 and prevent "Photon Crusher" from being destroyed by battle. [Notes 1]  As "Photon Crusher" is not a "Number" monster, the attack ends in a stalemate. On Quattro's End Phase, the effect of "Attack Gimmick" expires ("Gimmick Puppet Giant Grinder": 2000 → 1500 ATK).
 Turn 6: Kite 
 
                 Galaxy-Eyes Photon Dragon   " Galaxy-Eyes Photon Dragon " is Summoned.     Kite draws. He then Normal Summons " Photon Thrasher " ( 4/2100/0) in Attack Position and subsequently activates the effect of "Photon World" (Yuma, Trey and Quattro: 3600 → 3200 LP). Kite  Tributes  "Photon Crusher" and "Photon Thrasher" in order to Special Summon " Galaxy-Eyes Photon Dragon " ( 8/3000/2500) in Attack Position via its own effect (as the Tributed monsters had at least 2000 ATK). Kite activates the effect of "Photon World" (Yuma, Trey and Quattro: 3200 → 2400 LP). 
 "Galaxy-Eyes Photon Dragon" attacks "Gimmick Puppet Giant Grinder", but Trey activates his face-down " Stonehenge Shield " (as a monster with 3000 or more ATK is attacking) to negate the attack, reduce the ATK of "Galaxy-Eyes Photon Dragon" to 0 ("Galaxy-Eyes Photon Dragon": 3000 → 0 ATK) and negate its effects. As a monster's ATK was changed, Trey activates the effect of "Chronomaly Machu Mech" to detach an Overlay Unit ("Chronomaly Machu Mech": 2 → 1 ORU) and inflict damage to Kite equal to the difference between the original and current ATK of "Galaxy-Eyes Photon Dragon".
 Duel continues in  the next episode .
