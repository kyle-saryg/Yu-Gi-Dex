 Wheeler , known in Japan as  SAL  ( Super Animal Learning ), is an experimental monkey (chimpanzee) from the  Yu-Gi-Oh! GX  anime that has the ability to  Duel .
 
 Biography 
 Wheeler escapes the facility in which he's being held and takes  Jasmine  as a hostage. 
 Jaden  Duels for Jasmine's freedom and wins, only to realize that Wheeler will have to go back to the laboratory from which he escaped. 
 
With some help from  Professor Banner , Wheeler is set free to live in the wild with the rest of his kind. In the second season of  Yu-Gi-Oh! GX , Wheeler appears while Jaden was lost and disoriented from hunger in the forest, with Jaden believing Wheeler to be past opponents of his. After giving Jaden some bananas (and water when he begins to choke), Wheeler attempts to point him in the right direction to Duel Academy. However, Jaden misinterprets him and heads in the opposite direction.       Wheeler in  episode 66 .     
 In the English dub, Wheeler is probably named after  Joey Wheeler , who  Seto Kaiba  titles "a Dueling monkey" during the  second series anime.  In the Japanese version, his name is pronounced "Saru," the Japanese word for "monkey".
 The lab where Wheeler was wrought was apparently abandoned at some point between seasons 1 and 3. During Season 3,  Thelonious Viper  begins using the lab as a base of operations to monitor  Survival Duels .
 
 Deck 
 Wheeler uses a  Beast - Type  Simian   Deck , which includes cards such as " Acrobat Monkey " and " Berserk Gorilla ". He also uses the  Trap Card  " DNA Surgery ", to turn all  face-up   monsters  on the  field  into Beast-Types.
