 Biography 
       Iris gives  Nash  flowers.     Iris lived in ancient times, by the same period  Reginald Kastle  was  Nash  in his past life. She was a survivor of a town devastated by  Vector , and was found by Nash's army, [1]  who took her with them and looked after her. Nash noticed the striking resemblance Iris had with his deceased sister  Marin , and wondered if Iris was either sent to him by Marin or was Marin herself. Due to this, he grew close to her. One day, when Nash departed to confront Vector by himself, Nash's army went after Vector to fight alongside their king, with Iris coming as well. However, even though Nash defeated Vector, Iris was killed along with the rest of Nash's army. After learning this, Nash took Iris' body in his arms, and cried for her and his army's lives, while their souls were absorbed into  Barian World . [2]  When Shark was reliving his memories from this life,  Dumon  transported him, as well as himself and Rio to Barian World where Iris was shown to be living alongside Nash's soldiers, happy to see her king once again. [3]
