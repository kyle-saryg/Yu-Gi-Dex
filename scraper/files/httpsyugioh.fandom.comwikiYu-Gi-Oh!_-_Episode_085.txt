 Summary 
 On Board the KaibaCorp Airship 
 In the aftermath of  Yami 's Duel with  Bakura , everyone goes to ask  Kaiba  to land the airship so they can take Bakura to a hospital.  Joey , despite  Mokuba 's protests, bangs on Kaiba's door. After listening, Kaiba refuses to land the airship, stating that it's not his problem and that if Bakura can Duel, he can take care of himself. He does, however, call a medical team to take care of Bakura on the ship after Serenity starts to beg.
 Tristan  leaves to look for Bakura's missing  Millennium Ring  on the dueling platform (dragging  Duke  along to get him away from  Serenity ). Up top, Tristan and Duke get into a fight over Serenity in which Tristan trips and causes him and Duke to fall over the edge with Tristan barely managing to hang onto both the edge and Duke. Just as Tristan's hand slips, he is caught by  Shadi  and hauled back onto the platform. 
 Back in  Yugi 's room, while adjusting his deck, he notices Shadi's reflection in the window. Yugi tells Shadi that he knows the spirit of the  Millennium Puzzle  is really the spirit of the  Sealed Pharaoh . Shadi tells Yugi that all seven of the  Millennium Items  are onboard the ship along with all three  God Cards  and that the conditions are right to unlock the Pharaoh's memory.
 
 Pegasus's Journey to Egypt & the birth of Duel Monsters 
 Shadi also tells Yugi about  Pegasus 's journey to Egypt , who was trying to find a way to bring back his  wife  and ended up discovering carvings of monsters, including the Egyptian Gods, which later became the inspiration for the game of  Duel Monsters . Following his discovery however (and launching card production), Pegasus learned that nearly everyone involved with the production of the God Cards had begun to die under mysterious circumstances (including a scene cut from the English dub, of the photo developer being punched out of his hotel's dark room by Obelisk's Fist of Fury), having incurred the wrath of the Gods themselves. The rest of his team was too afraid to continue working on the project. Pegasus refused to stop making the cards however, deciding to take onto the task himself as a challenge to the Gods. On the night after he finished the cards' design, his  Millennium Eye  showed him a vision of ancient Egypt in his sleep: the world was being destroyed by the Gods!
 At this point, Shadi appeared to Pegasus. He told him the monsters were real and that Pegasus could not control both the Darkness and the Gods at the same time;  the solution was to seal the God Cards back in Egypt for they were too powerful . Pegasus, having experienced the Gods' power himself, took the completed cards and gave them to  Ishizu  to be sealed.
 
 Back in the Present... 
 Back in the present, Shadi tells Yami that all he needs to do to awaken his memory is to win the tournament. Shadi then comes to Ishizu, who tells him a horrible fate is awaiting Marik and that she joined the tournament to stop it.
 
 Mistakes 
       Yugi's Deck on the table in the dub     
 When Yugi's Deck is displaced on the Table the monster card  Cyber Jar  is shown as a  Spell Card . 
 When Yugi's Deck is displaced on the Table the spell card  Graceful Charity  is shown. It is incorrectly replaced by the monster card  Lady of Faith  in the English Dub. 
 When Yugi's Deck is displaced on the Table the trap card  Magic Jammer  is shown. It is incorrectly replaced by the spell card  Black Illusion Ritual  in the English Dub. 
 When the Gods's prototype cards are finished they're shown to have PS3 written on them.
