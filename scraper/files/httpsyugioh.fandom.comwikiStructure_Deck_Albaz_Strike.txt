 Legend of the Crystal Beasts 
 
 
 
 
 
 On a distant, abyssal world, where different groups co-exist as both allies and enemies, comes the Fallen of Albaz, a mysterious but powerful figure with no memory of his past. His journey intertwines the destinies of those he meets, and brings their stories together in this Structure Deck of high adventure, containing cards from all four groups, plus the Fallen of Albaz himself and his many Fusion Dragon forms!

 Art Story 
 The radiant sky is dyed in red 
Thus begins the  March of the Dead 
The children gather in joy to mourn 
And dance until dawn is born. 
 
Seeking out the final marks, 
the  mighty  and the  pure . 
Until we find the branded pair 
our search, it shall endure. 
 
 
 The curtain rises on this play ... 
the story of a  boy  and  girl , 
mere playthings of fate. 
 
 Even if you turn into dust ... 
Hold on to the  fire lit in your hearts 
it will become the flame that guides you. 
 
 
Atop the  cradle ... 
 The two born   of the Abyss 
 confront each other . 
The Crimson Flame engulfs the Darkness 
and the  Divine Flame  is born! 
 
 His burnt flesh, naught but soot . 
A  sword of burning ice 
is born from his heart. 
Glowing like campfire embers... 
A tempered blade forged from memories.
