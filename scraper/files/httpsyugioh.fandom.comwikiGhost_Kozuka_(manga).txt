 Biography 
 Duelist Kingdom 
 Kozuka took part in the  Duelist Kingdom  tournament. Here he met up with,  Takaido , [Note 1]   Satake [Note 1]  and  Bandit Keith Howard . Keith was the former United States champion, but had not been invited to the tournament. He offered to help the Kozuka, Takaido and Satake earn forty  Star Chips  between them, so that the four of them could enter  Pegasus Castle , as the semifinalists. With his help they had earned four, five and five Star Chips respectively, before Kozuka and Satake spotted a group of people, including  Yugi Mutou , while searching for opponents. They informed Keith of their find, but thought they were better avoiding this group, as Yugi would be too difficult to defeat. However, Keith suggested that they separate the other Duelist from that group,  Katsuya Jonouchi  and force him to Duel in the hidden underground crypt. As the crypt had a  Graveyard terrain , which strengthened undead cards, Keith suggested that Kozuka Duel, since his Deck was filled with Ghost cards. However, after looking through it, he said it would not suffice, so he lent Kozuka some of his own cards, to strengthen it. When Jonouchi left his friends to urinate in private, Kozuka, Takaido and Satake snuck up behind him, grabbed him and dragged him into the crypt. [1]  Kozuka imposed the wager of four Star Chips for  the Duel . [3] 
 
       Kozuka,  Dueling   Katsuya Jonouchi     
 Kozuka planned on Summoning a Ghost card, but was stopped by Keith, who over the next three turns, insisted that he play non-Ghost cards, which were all weaker than Jonouchi's monsters. Kozuka then drew " Call of the Haunted ", which revived the destroyed monsters as Zombies, powered up by the Graveyard terrain [3]  and capable of resurrecting even stronger when beaten. When Kozuka was about to attack one turn, Keith suggested that he draw another card to try and power up the Zombies, even further first. Kozuka then got " Pumpking the King of Ghosts ", which powered up his Zombies every turn. [4]  Jonouchi played safe, but putting his monsters in  Defense Mode , but Kozuka eventually drew " Stop Defense ". Jonouchi used " Red-Eyes Black Dragon " to destroy "Pumpking" and on his last turn, used " Shield and Sword ", which switched the  ATK  and  DEF  of all monsters. The Zombies, which only attacked based on instinct, were incapable of defending and as such had 0 DEF, which became their new ATK. This gave Jonouchi an opening to damage Kozuka's  Life Points  and win the Duel. [5] 
 
       Keith  turns on Kozuka.     
 After exiting the crypt, Keith then ordered Kozuka, Takaido and Satake to block the exit with a boulder, trapping Jonouchi, Yugi and their friends inside. They obeyed, but Kozuka wondered if they had went too far. Keith then moved on to his "next order of business" and proceeded to beat up Kozuka for losing, kicking him in the stomach. Kozuka pleaded that he had only played the cards Keith told him to, but Keith insisted that he should have won in that case and kicked him in the face. As Kozuka lay on the ground, Keith spat on him and commented that without his Star Chips, he was useless and should just die. Keith also took Takaido and Satake's Star Chips and beat them up, leaving the three lying on the ground in pain, while he went to Pegasus Castle alone. [6] 
 
 Battle City 
       Kozuka, killed by  Dark Bakura     
 "Ghost" Kozuka was one of the many Duelists who migrated to  Domino City  at the rumor of a new  Duel Monsters  tournament being announced by  Seto Kaiba  at  Domino City Museum . The next day, Kozuka was present at the opening ceremony of the  Battle City  tournament, with the rest of the eligible Duelists. [7] 
 During the actual tournament, he Dueled  Dark Bakura  shortly before the championship stages, but his Ghost Deck was easily overpowered by Dark Bakura's Occult Deck. Kozuka lost  the Duel  and his  Puzzle Cards . As a  Penalty Game , Dark Bakura took his life, using the  Millennium Ring . [2] 
 
 Duel Links 
In the non-canon game Duel Links, Bonz is revealed to have survived Battle City and reappears as a playable character. However, his encounter with Bakura has left him frightened.  
 Deck 
 Kozuka used a Ghost Deck, during  Duelist Kingdom . However  Bandit Keith  considered it insufficient for  his Duel  against  Katsuya Jonouchi  and lent him cards to make it more powerful. His new Deck contained a number of non-Ghost monsters, which he was able to revive through " Call of the Haunted ", as near-unkillable Zombies. The  Graveyard terrain  and " Pumpking the King of Ghosts " made them stronger. The last part of the combo was " Stop Defense ", to ensure the Zombies could damage the opponent's  Life Points .
 In  Battle City , Kozuka still used a Ghost Deck. However, none of his cards were shown.
