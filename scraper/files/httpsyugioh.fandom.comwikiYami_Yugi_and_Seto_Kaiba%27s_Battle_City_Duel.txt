Kaiba draws " Obelisk the Tormentor ". He then Normal Summons " X-Head Cannon " (1800/1500) in  Attack Position . Kaiba then activates " Spell Sanctuary " to allow both players to add a Spell Card from their  Deck  to their hands: Yugi selects " Change of Heart " while Seto selects " Soul Exchange ". As long as "Spell Sanctuary" remains in play, both players can activate any kind of Spell Card during their opponent's turn, as long as it is face down. Kaiba then Sets a card.

Yami Yugi draws "Alpha the Magnet Warrior". Yugi's hand contains "Big Shield Gardna", "Exchange", "Collected Power", "Magical Hats", "Change of Heart", and "Alpha the Magnet Warrior". Yami Yugi then Normal Summons " Alpha The Magnet Warrior " (1400/1700) in  Defense Position  and Sets a card.
 Turn 4: Kaiba 
Kaiba draws "Interdimensional Matter Transporter". Kaiba's hand contains " Lullaby of Obedience ", " Power Balance ", "Obelisk the Tormentor", "Soul Exchange", and " Interdimensional Matter Transporter ". Kaiba activates "Soul Exchange" in order to allow himself to Tribute Yugi's monsters as if they were his monsters. Kaiba plans to Tribute Yugi's "Queen's Knight" and "Alpha the Magnet Warrior" with his own "X-Head Cannon" in order to Tribute Summon "Obelisk the Tormentor", but Yugi activates his face-down "Change of Heart" to take control of Seto's "X-Head Cannon" until the end of the turn. 
 Seto then activates his face-down " Enemy Controller " to pay 1000 Life Points ( Seto  4000 → 3000) and take control of "X-Head Cannon". Yugi then activates his face-down " Lightforce Sword " to remove from play "Obelisk the Tormentor" from Seto's hand for three turns. Kaiba's hand now contains "Lullaby of Obedience", "Power Balance", and "Interdimensional Matter Transporter".
 Turn 5: Yami Yugi 
Yami Yugi draws "Life Shaver". Yugi's hand contains " Big Shield Gardna ", " Exchange ", " Collected Power ", " Magical Hats ", and "Life Shaver". Yami Yugi Sets a card.
 Turn 6: Kaiba 
First turn that "Lightforce Sword" is keeping Seto's "Obelisk the Tormentor" removed from the game. Kaiba draws " Y-Dragon Head " and subsequently Normal Summons it (1500/1600) in Attack Position. He then activates the effect of "Y-Dragon Head" to equip itself to "X-Head Cannon" and increase its ATK and DEF by 400 ("X-Head Cannon": 1800 → 2200/1500 → 1900) in  Attack Position . 
 "X-Head Cannon" attacks and destroys "Alpha The Magnet Warrior". Kaiba then activates " Lullaby of Obedience " to pay 1000 Life Points ( Seto  3000 → 2000) and take " Slifer the Sky Dragon " from Yugi's  Deck  and add it to his hand. Yugi then activates his face-down "Exchange", which allows each player to take a card from the other's hand: Yugi selects "Slifer the Sky Dragon" while Seto selects " Life Shaver ". 
 Yami Yugi has 4000  Life Points  remaining and controls "Queen's Knight" (1500/1600) in Defense Position.
 Kaiba has 2000 Life Points remaining and controls "X-Head Cannon" (2200/1900) in Attack Position and "Y-Dragon Head" (who is equipped to "X-Head Cannon" and " Spell Sanctuary ".
 Turn 7: Yami Yugi 
Yugi's hand contains "Big Shield Gardna", " Magical Hats " " Collected Power ", "Slifer the Sky Dragon". Yami Yugi draws "Soul Rope". He then Normal Summons " Big Shield Gardna " (100/2600) in  Defense Position  and Sets a card.
 Turn 8: Kaiba 
Second turn that " Lightforce Sword " is keeping Seto's " Obelisk the Tormentor " removed from the game. Kaiba draws "Z-Metal Tank". He then Sets a card and Normal Summons " Z-Metal Tank " (1500/1300) in Attack Position. Kaiba then activates the effect of " Y-Dragon Head " to unequip itself from " X-Head Cannon " ("X-Head Cannon": 2200 → 1800/1900 → 1500). Kaiba then sends "X-Head Cannon", "Y-Dragon Head", and "Z-Metal Tank" to the Graveyard in order to  Special Summon  " XYZ-Dragon Cannon " (2800/2600) in Attack Position. 
 "XYZ-Dragon Cannon" attacks & destroys Yugi's "Big Shield Gardna". Since one of his monsters was destroyed, Yugi activates his face-down " Soul Rope " to pay 1000 Life Points ( Yugi  4000 → 3000) and  Special Summon  " King's Knight " (1600/1400) in Attack Position. Since Yugi had "Queen's Knight" on his side of the field when he summoned "King's Knight", Yugi activates the effect of " King's Knight " to  Special Summon  " Jack's Knight " (1900/1000) in Attack Position. 
 Turn 9: Yami Yugi 
Yami Yugi draws " Pot of Greed ". He then Tributes "Queen's Knight", "King's Knight", and "Jack's Knight" in order to Tribute Summon " Slifer the Sky Dragon " (X000/X000) in Attack Position. Due to the effect of "Slifer the Sky Dragon", it gains 1000 ATK and DEF for each card in Yami Yugi's hand. He currently has three ("Slifer the Sky Dragon": 0 → 3000/0 → 3000). "Slifer the Sky Dragon" attacks "XYZ-Dragon Cannon", but Seto activates his face-down " Interdimensional Matter Transporter " to remove "XYZ-Dragon Cannon" from play until his next turn. Because of that, "Slifer's" attack is negated as its original target was removed from the field (NOTE: in the real game, this would create a  replay  and Yugi could just attack Kaiba directly and defeat him). Yami Yugi then sets a card ("Pot of Greed") ("Slifer the Sky Dragon": 3000 → 2000/3000 → 2000). On Yami Yugi's End Phase, "XYZ-Dragon Cannon" returns to the field (2800/2600) in Attack Position due to the effect of "Interdimensional Matter Transporter".
 Turn 10: Kaiba 
 
       Now both players have an  Egyptian God  card on the field     
 Seto draws. Third turn that "Lightforce Sword" is keeping Seto's "Obelisk the Tormentor" removed from the game. "Obelisk the Tormentor" returns to Seto's hand during his Standby Phase (NOTE: in the real game, "Lightforce Sword" keeps the card for 3 *full* turns and returns it on the opponent's *4th* Standby Phase, i.e. Seto's next turn). Seto then Tributes "XYZ-Dragon Cannon" in order to Tribute Summon "Obelisk the Tormentor" (4000/4000) in Attack Position (as according to the Battle City Rules, a Fusion Monster counts as a number of Tributes equal to the number of Fusion Material Monsters required to summoned it). 
 Yami Yugi has 3000  Life Points  remaining and controls "Slifer the Sky Dragon" (2000/2000) in Attack Position and one set card.
 Kaiba has 2000 Life Points remaining and controls "Obelisk the Tormentor" (4000/4000) in Attack Position and " Spell Sanctuary ". 
 Turn 10: Kaiba 
 Seto Kaiba  has just managed to summon " Obelisk the Tormentor ". The second mouth effect of " Slifer the Sky Dragon " then activates, which reduces the ATK of "Obelisk the Tormentor" by 2000 ("Obelisk the Tormentor": 4000 → 2000/4000). Kaiba sets two cards ("Command Silencer" and " Life Shaver "). On Kaiba's End Phase, the second mouth effect of "Slifer" expires for "Obelisk" ("Obelisk the Tormentor": 2000 → 4000/4000). 
 Turn 11: Yami Yugi 
Yami Yugi draws ("Slifer the Sky Dragon": 2000 → 3000/2000 → 3000). He then activates his face-down " Pot of Greed " to draw two cards ("Slifer the Sky Dragon": 3000 → 5000/3000 → 5000). "Slifer the Sky Dragon" attacks "Obelisk the Tormentor", but Seto activates his face-down " Command Silencer " to negate the attack and draw a card. Yami Yugi then sets two cards ("Slifer the Sky Dragon": 5000 → 3000/5000 → 3000).
 Turn 12: Kaiba 
 
       "Obelisk" prepares to attack Yugi     
 Kaiba draws.  Yami Yugi  then activates his face-down " Card Destruction " to force both players to discard their hands and draw the same amount of cards they discarded. Yami Yugi then activates his face-down " Disgraceful Charity " to allow both players to add all cards discarded this turn back to their hands ("Slifer the Sky Dragon": 3000 → 6000/3000 → 6000). 
 Seto activates " Thirst for Compensation " from his hand to  Special Summon  " Blade Knight " (1600/1000) and " Sword of Soul " (0/1900) from his hand in face-up Defense Position. The second mouth effect of "Slifer the Sky Dragon" activates, which would destroy both summoned monsters, but Seto activates " Card Guard " from his hand to prevent "Sword of Soul" and "Blade Knight" from being destroyed this turn by discarding one card (" Kaiser Sea Horse "). 
 Kaiba then activates the second effect of "Obelisk the Tormentor" to destroy all of Yami Yugi's monsters by Tributing "Blade Knight" and "Sword of Soul". While "Slifer the Sky Dragon" isn't destroyed, the second effect of "Obelisk the Tormentor" proceeds in inflicting 4000 damage to Yami Yugi, but Yami Yugi discards " Kuriboh " to make the damage he would take 0 ("Slifer the Sky Dragon": 6000 → 5000/6000 → 5000). Kaiba Sets a card.
 Turn 13: Yami Yugi 
 
       "Slifer" attacks "Obelisk"     
 Yami Yugi draws ("Slifer the Sky Dragon": 5000 → 6000/5000 → 6000). "Slifer the Sky Dragon" attacks "Obelisk the Tormentor", but Seto activates his face-down " Power Balance " to force Yugi to discard half the cards in his hand and allow Seto to draw the same number of cards Yugi discarded. Yugi is currently holding six, so he discards "Collected Power", "Electromagnetic Turtle", and "Chain Destruction" ("Slifer the Sky Dragon": 6000 → 3000/6000 → 3000). Yugi's hand now contains " Magical Hats ", "Spell Textbook", and "Necromancy". 
 Yugi then activates " Necromancy " ("Slifer the Sky Dragon": 3000 → 2000/3000 → 2000) to  Special Summon  "Blade Knight" (1600/1000), "Sword of Soul" (0/1900), "Kaiser Sea Horse" (1700/1650) and " X-Head Cannon " (1800/1500) from Seto's Graveyard to his side of the field in Defense Position. The second mouth effect of "Slifer the Sky Dragon" activates ("Blade Knight": 1600/1000 → 0; "Sword of Soul": 0/1900 → 0; "Kaiser Sea Horse": 1700/1650 → 0; "X-Head Cannon": 1800/1500 → 0). Due to the third effect of "Slifer" ( If a monsters ATK is 2000 or less that monster is destroyed ), the newly summoned monsters are all destroyed. 
 Due to the second effect of "Necromancy", Seto's monsters lose 600  ATK  for each "Necromancy"-summoned monster that was destroyed until the End Phase ("Obelisk the Tormentor": 4000 → 1600/4000). Since "Sword of Soul" was destroyed and sent to the Graveyard, its effect activates, allowing Seto to increase Obelisk's  ATK  by 1000 ("Obelisk the Tormentor": 1600 → 2600/4000). Yugi activates the effect of " Electromagnetic Turtle " from his  Graveyard  to immediately end the  Battle Phase . 
 Yami Yugi Sets a card ("Spell Textbook") (" Slifer the Sky Dragon ": 2000 → 1000/2000 → 1000). On Yami Yugi's End Phase, the effect of "Sword of Soul" expires ("Obelisk the Tormentor": 2600 → 4000/4000).
 Turn 14: Kaiba 
Kaiba draws. "Obelisk the Tormentor" attacks "Slifer the Sky Dragon", but Yugi activates his face-down " Spell Textbook " to discard all cards in his hand ("Magical Hats") ("Slifer the Sky Dragon": 1000 → 0/1000 → 0) and draw a card. If that card is a  Magic Card  Yugi can activate it. Yugi draws " Card of Sanctity " and subsequently activates it, allowing both players to draw until they're holding six cards, letting Yami Yugi draw six cards while Kaiba draws two cards ("Slifer the Sky Dragon": 0 → 6000/0 → 6000). Seto activates his face-down "Life Shaver" to force Yugi to discard one card from his hand for each turn that "Life Shaver" was on the field. "Life Shaver" was set on the field for two turns ("Slifer the Sky Dragon": 6000 → 4000/6000 → 4000).
 
Yami Yugi has 3000  Life Points  remaining and controls "Slifer the Sky Dragon" (4000/4000) in Attack Position.
 Seto Kaiba has 2000 Life Points remaining and controls "Obelisk the Tormentor" (4000/4000) in Attack Position and " Spell Sanctuary ".
 Turn 14: Kaiba 
As " Obelisk the Tormentor " and " Slifer the Sky Dragon " collide for mutual destruction, a beam of light erupts from the tower, causing Yugi and Seto to see a vision from the Ancient Egyptian past. "Obelisk the Tormentor" and "Slifer the Sky Dragon" are destroyed in a  Double KO . Kaiba Sets a card ("Cloning"). Seto's hand contains two " Blue-Eyes White Dragons ", " Final Attack Orders ", " Polymerization ", and  An unknown card . (NOTE: Due to a mistake, this card could either be "Magical Trick Mirror" or "Card of Demise".)
 Turn 15: Yami Yugi 
Yami Yugi draws " Gazelle the King of Mythical Beasts " and subsequently Normal Summons it (1500/1200) in  Defense Position . Seto activates face-down " Cloning " to Special Summon a " Clone Token " with the same stats as Yugi's "Gazelle the King of Mythical Beasts" (1500/1200) in Defense Position. Yami Yugi Sets a card.
 Turn 16: Kaiba 
Kaiba draws " Cost Down " and subsequently activates it to lower the  Level  of "Blue-Eyes White Dragon" by two. Kaiba then Tributes his "Clone Token" in order to Tribute Summon "Blue-Eyes White Dragon" (3000/2500) in Attack Position. "Blue-Eyes White Dragon" attacks and destroys "Gazelle the King of Mythical Beasts".
 Turn 17: Yami Yugi 
Yami Yugi draws " Monster Reborn " and subsequently activates it to  Special Summon  " Dark Magician " (2500/2100) from his Graveyard in  Attack Position  (he discarded it previously due to Seto's " Life Shaver "). Yami Yugi then Sets a card.
 Turn 18: Kaiba 
Kaiba draws. He then Sets a card. Kaiba then activates " Card of Demise " to draw until he has five cards in his hand (his hand contains three cards so he draws two cards). Five turns after the activation of "Card of Demise", Seto must discard his entire hand during his Standby Phase. Kaiba then Normal Summons " Lord of Dragons " (1200/1100) in  Attack Position . Due to the effect of "Lord of D.", Seto can now protect all his  Dragon - Type  monsters from  Card effects  that target monsters.
 Turn 19: Yami Yugi 
Yami Yugi draws " Beta The Magnet Warrior " and subsequently Normal Summons it (1700/1600) in  Defense Position . "Dark Magician" attacks "Lord of Dragons", but Seto activates his face-down " Magical Trick Mirror " to activate the "Monster Reborn" in Yugi's  Graveyard  as his card, allowing Kaiba to  Special Summon  "Obelisk the Tormentor" (4000/4000) from his Graveyard in  Defense Position . Due to the effect of "Obelisk the Tormentor", "Dark Magician's" attack is redirected to "Obelisk" instead. The attack fails ( Yugi  3000 → 1500).
 Yugi has 1500  Life Points  remaining and controls "Dark Magician" (2500/2100) in Attack Position, "Beta The Magnet Warrior" (1700/1600) in Defense Position, and two set cards.
 Kaiba has 2000 Life Points remaining and controls "Blue-Eyes White Dragon" (3000/2500) and "Lord of Dragons" (1200/1100) in Attack Position, "Obelisk the Tormentor" in Defense Position, and " Spell Sanctuary ".
 Turn 19: Yami Yugi 
Seto has just blocked Yugi's " Dark Magician 's" attack by reviving " Obelisk the Tormentor " through the effect of " Monster Reborn ". Yami Yugi Sets a card. On Yugi's End Phase, "Obelisk the Tormentor" returns to the Graveyard.
 Turn 20: Kaiba 
Kaiba draws "The Flute of Summoning Dragon". He then switches " Lord of Dragons " (1200/1100) to  Defense Position . Kaiba then activates " The Flute of Summoning Dragon " to  Special Summon  two more " Blue-Eyes White Dragons " from his hand (3000/2500 for both) in Attack Position. Yami Yugi then uses the effect of "The Flute of Summoning Dragon" to Special Summon " Red-Eyes Black Dragon " from his hand (2400/2000) in  Attack Position . 
 The first "Blue-Eyes White Dragon" attacks "Dark Magician", but Yugi activates his face-down " Magician's Selection " to negate the attack and destroy "Lord of D.". The second "Blue-Eyes White Dragon" attacks and destroys " Beta The Magnet Warrior ". The last "Blue-Eyes White Dragon" attacks "Red-Eyes Black Dragon", but Yugi activates his face-down " Spellbinding Circle " to reduce the ATK of "Blue-Eyes White Dragon" by 700 ("Blue-Eyes White Dragon": 3000 → 2300/2500).  "Red-Eyes Black Dragon" counter attacks and destroys the " Blue-Eyes White Dragon " affected by "Spellbinding Circle" ( Seto  2000 → 1900). 
 As this is happening, Joey awakens from his coma and heads up to the top of the tower to see the duel conclude.
 
Yugi has 1500  Life Points  remaining and controls "Dark Magician" (2500/2100) and "Red-Eyes Black Dragon" (2400/2000) in Attack Position and one set card.
 Kaiba has 1900 Life Points remaining and controls two "Blue-Eyes White Dragons" (3000/2500 for both) in Attack Position and " Spell Sanctuary ".
 Turn 20: Kaiba 
One of Kaiba's " Blue-Eyes White Dragon " has just been destroyed in battle by " Red-Eyes Black Dragon ". He sets two cards.
 Turn 21: Yami Yugi 
Yami Yugi draws "Double Spell". He then Sets a card and switches "Red-Eyes Black Dragon" to  Defense Position . Seto then activates his face-down " Final Attack Orders ", which forces all face-up monsters into  Attack Position  and makes both players pick three cards in their  Deck  to keep in their Deck while sending the remaining cards that were not picked to the Graveyard.
 Turn 22: Kaiba 
Two turns have passed since " Card of Demise 's" activation: in three turns Seto must discard his entire hand. Kaiba draws " Monster Reborn " and subsequently activates it to revive "Blue-Eyes White Dragon" (3000/2500) in Attack Position. Kaiba then activates his face-down " Polymerization " to fuse his three "Blue-Eyes White Dragons" together and Fusion Summon " Blue-Eyes Ultimate Dragon " (4500/3800) in Attack Position. Under  Battle City Rules ,  Fusion Monsters  cannot attack the same turn they are  summoned . 
 Yami Yugi then activates his face-down " Double Spell " to activate any  Spell Card  Seto activated this turn as his cards. Yugi uses the effect of "Double Spell" to activate Seto's "Monster Reborn" and revive " Buster Blader " (2600/2300) in  Attack Position . Yugi then uses the effect of "Double Spell" to activate Seto's "Polymerization", allowing Yami Yugi to fuse " Dark Magician " and "Buster Blader" together and Fusion Summon " Dark Paladin " (2900/2400) in Attack Position. Due to the effect of "Dark Paladin", its  ATK  increases by 500 for each  Dragon - Type  monster on the field. There are currently two ("Dark Paladin": 2900 → 3900/2400).
 Turn 23: Yami Yugi 
Yami Yugi draws. He then Sets a card.
 Turn 24: Kaiba 
Three turns have passed since the activation of "Card of Demise": in two turns Seto must discard his entire hand. Kaiba draws "Absorb Spell". "Blue-Eyes Ultimate Dragon" attacks "Red-Eyes B. Dragon", but Yugi activates his face-down " Magic Formula " in order to equip it to "Dark Paladin" and increase the ATK of "Dark Paladin" by 500, however Seto activates " Absorb Spell " to equip "Magic Formula" onto "Blue-Eyes Ultimate Dragon", ignoring the target requirements ("Blue-Eyes Ultimate Dragon": 4500 → 5000/3800). 
 Yugi then activates his face-down " De-Fusion " to return "Blue-Eyes Ultimate Dragon" to the Fusion Deck and Special Summon all three "Blue-Eyes White Dragons" (3000/2500 for all) from the Graveyard to Kaiba's side of the field in Attack Position ("Dark Paladin": 2900 → 4900/2400). Since "Blue-Eyes Ultimate Dragon" was removed from the field when it attacked, the attack is negated.
 Turn 25: Yami Yugi 
Yami Yugi draws " Diffusion Wave-Motion " and subsequently activates it to pay 1000 Life Points ( Yugi  1500 → 500) and allow "Dark Paladin" to attack all of Seto’s monsters once each (NOTE 1: " Diffusion Wave-Motion " was not really necessary, since simply attacking one "Blue-Eyes White Dragon" would have won Yugi the duel; this is presumably done for dramatic effect.). "Dark Paladin" attacks & destroys all three "Blue-Eyes White Dragons" ( Seto  1900 → 0).
 
 Aftermath 
 Kaiba is angry that Yugi cheated him out of his victory, but has no choice but to surrender "Obelisk the Tormentor" to Yami Yugi. Joey was happy that Yugi won and Yugi was happy to see Joey okay.
