 Featured Duel: Shoma Yusa vs. Ms. Guide 
 Turn 1: Miss Guide 
Miss Guide activates " Adamancipator Laputite "  Field Spell Card , which increases the  ATK  and  DEF  of all  Rock   monsters  on the field by 500. She active its effect to  excavate  the up to 5 " Adamancipator " cards of her  Deck , and put them back in the order she desires (the revealed ones are " Adamancipator Crystal - Leonite ", "Adamancipator Laputite", " Adamancipator Crystal - Dragite ", " Adamancipator Analyzer " and " Adamancipator Seeker "). Next, she  Normal Summons  "Adamancipator Analyzer" ( Level  4/1500 → 2000/700 → 1200). Ms. Guide  activates  its  effect , excavating five cards of her Deck, adding one of them to her hand (she chooses "Adamancipator Crystal - Leonite"), and the rest are placed to the bottom of her Deck. With the effect of "Leonite", Ms. Guide takes "Adamancipator Crystal Dragite" from her hand, and places it on the top of her Deck. Next, she Special Summons "Adamancipator Seeker" in  Defense Position  (Level 2/1200 → 1700/1000 → 1500), as she controls "Adamancipator Analyzer".
 She activates its effect to excavate five cards of her Deck, and Special Summon the monster she placed on the Deck a moment ago: "Adamancipator Crystal - Leonite" is Special Summoned in Defense Position (Level 4/0 → 500/2200 → 2700). Ms. Guide tunes the Level 2 "Adamancipator Seeker" with Level 4 "Leonite", Synchro Summoning " Adamancipator Risen - Leonite " (Level 6/2400 → 2900/2200 → 2700) in  Attack Position  to her  Extra Monster Zone . Ms. Guide uses its effect to excavate five cards from her Deck, keep one of them in her  hand  (she chooses " Adamancipator Signs " and place the rest to the bottom of her Deck. Ms. Guide then tunes the remaining Level 4 "Adamancipator Analyzer" with Level 4 "Dragite", Synchro Summoning " Adamancipator Risen - Dragite " (Level 8/3000 → 3500/2200 → 2700).
 Turn 2: Shoma Yusa 
Shoma activates " Galloping Gaia " Field Spell Card, though Ms. Guide uses the effect of "Adamancipator Risen - Dragite" to negate its  activation  and destroy it. Shoma Normal Summons " Artillery Catapult Turtle " (Level 4/1000/2000). He then activates its effect to  Tribute  one monster and Special Summon a "Gaia the Fierce Knight" monster or Level 5  Dragon  monster from his hand or Deck. He Tributes "Artillery Catapult Turtle" and Special Summons " Gaia the Magical Knight " (Level 7/2300/2100) from his Deck in Attack Position. as it being Special Summoned, Shoma uses its effect to Special Summon " Curse of Dragon, the Cursed Dragon " in Attack Position (Level 5/2000/1500).
 The latter's effect lets Shoma add " Spiral Fusion "  Normal Spell Card , which he consequently activates: he fuses "Curse of Dragon" and "Gaia",  Fusion Summoning  " Gaia the Magical Knight of Dragons " (Level 7/2600/2100). As it was summoned by "Sprial Fusion", this turn, "Gaia the Magical Knight of Dragons" can attack twice, with its ATK increased by 2600 ("Gaia the Magical Knight": 2600 → 5200 ATK). Shoma chains the effect of the "Cursed of Dragon" sent to the GY: it negates the effects of Ms. Guide's monsters, since all of them have less ATK than "Gaia the Magical Knight of Dragons". Ms. Guide activates the  Quick Effect  of "Adamancipator Risen - Leonite" to Special Summon a Rock monster from her Graveyard, as she has a  FIRE  monster in her GY, she Special Summons "Adamancipator Analyzer" from the  GY  in Defense Position, but the effect of "the Cursed Dragon" still negates their effects. "Gaia"  attacks  the "Risen Leonite", destroying it (Ms. Guide: 8000 → 5700 LP). As "Gaia" has destroyed a monster in battle, it gains an additional 2600 ATK ("Gaia": 5200 → 7800 ATK), then it attacks "Risen Dragite" and destroys it, too (Ms. Guide: 5700 → 1400 LP).
 Duel continues in the next chapter .
