 This was fine the way it was. I don't see how classifying  ZEXAL  as season 1 and  ZEXAL II  as season 2 is a problem. We need to either do it this way, or split it into four short seasons to coincide with the arc listings (which I'm against, since an arc is not the same thing as a season). The entirety of  ZEXAL  is in no way a single season either.  Cheesedude  ( talk  •  contribs ) 19:36, December 1, 2012 (UTC)
 
 Agreed. -- Golden Key  ( talk  •  contribs ) 20:30, December 1, 2012 (UTC) 
 WDC is the second season . -- The Goblin  20:57, December 1, 2012 (UTC) 
 You seem to have adopted a new stance on arcs and seasons in the past 2 months, Cheesedude... -- Golden Key  ( talk  •  contribs ) 21:21, December 1, 2012 (UTC) 
 Correct, I have. For  GX , an arc and a season  are  the same thing, but that's only incidental. I would argue that  5D's  has five arcs and two seasons. All that said, there is zero official clarification, so an argument can also be made that all of  ZEXAL  is one season, I simply disagree with that argument.

 What if we called the two pages "Yu-Gi-Oh! ZEXAL episode listing", including 1-73 and "Yu-Gi-Oh! ZEXAL II episode listing", including 74 onwards? 'Just treating  Yu-Gi-Oh! ZEXAL II  as the name of the season, rather than a new series. The episode pages etc. would still say that they are episodes of  Yu-Gi-Oh! ZEXAL . Even if people disagree that this is season 2, they should probably agree that is  Yu-Gi-Oh! ZEXAL II . --  Deltaneos  ( talk ) 11:57, December 4, 2012 (UTC) 
 That's fine, though we'd still have to have it read as "2" in the infobox, wouldn't we?  Cheesedude  ( talk  •  contribs ) 16:56, December 4, 2012 (UTC) 
 Yeah, we'd still use season = 2 in the infoboxes to match the season number for  this page . --  Deltaneos  ( talk ) 17:11, December 4, 2012 (UTC) 
 Ok then. Any other objections or can we move on with this?  Cheesedude  ( talk  •  contribs ) 17:12, December 4, 2012 (UTC) 
 arcs 
 i bet the sixth arc is gonna be the final part in the zexal season, as the most crucial and important in the relationship between yuma, shark and rio. --Malek Kriya 00:53, September 26, 2013 (UTC)
