 Society of Light  is the second arc of the  Yu-Gi-Oh! GX  anime, encompassing the series' second season. [1]  The dubbed version splits it into two arcs, with  Society of Light  encompassing the first half and  Genex Tournament  encompassing the second half.
 The main antagonist in this arc is  Sartorius , the leader of the Society of Light. Many new characters are introduced here such as  Tyranno Hassleberry  and  Aster Phoenix . 
 
 Summary 
 It starts out at the beginning of  Jaden Yuki 's sophomore year at  Duel Academy , with Jaden meeting  Aster Phoenix  and beating him and then meeting and befriending  Tyranno Hassleberry  after beating him 
 Zane Truesdale  has graduated. He appears Dueling in the  Pro League , and suffers his first real loss at the hands of Aster, followed by Jaden losing to Aster, sent by Sartorius. Jaden loses the ability to see his cards after this loss and proceeds to give up Dueling. While trying to escape Duel Academy, he gets transported to  Neo Space . There he learns to true threat of  The Light of Destruction  and Society of Light. He obtains the " Neo-Spacians " and " Elemental Hero Neos ", and Duels Aster again, resulting in his victory this time.
 Meanwhile,  Chazz Princeton ,  Alexis Rhodes ,  Bastion Misawa , and the majority of  Obelisk Blue  and  Ra Yellow  join the  Society of Light , led by Sartorius. Zane Truesdale has a major change of heart, becoming disrespectful and sadistic. Zane manages to obtain the " Cyberdark " Deck of the Underworld, which is the opposite of his  Cyber Style  Deck.
 Chancellor Sheppard  has opened the  Genex Tournament , with Duel Academy, Zane Truesdale, Sartorius,  Prince Ojin , the owner of the satellite  SORA , participating, among others. Prince Ojin hands Sartorius the keys to SORA, giving him control. Jaden Duels many others in the Genex Tournament, managing to bring Chazz and Alexis back to their senses, while Bastion quits the Society.
 Aster betrays Sartorius, and becomes Jaden's ally. Aster has also discovered the murderer of his father,  The D , owner of " Destiny Hero - Plasma ", and possessed by the Light of Destruction. Out of anger, Aster Duels The D, where he sees his father's spirit, who tells Aster that the Light of Destruction is possessing Sartorius as well. After Aster defeats The D, he leaves to Duel Sartorius.
 Jaden manages to defeat Prince Ojin, making the Light of Destruction leave his body.
 Sartorius eventually defeats Aster in a Duel, but Jaden Duels Sartorius. During the Duel, Sartorius makes the Light possess Ojin and gives him the key, and begins to fire the satellite, which will destroy everyone in the world (brainwash everyone in the dub).  Tyranno Hassleberry's  spirit and  Neos  manage to destroy the satellite, while Jaden defeats Sartorius, making the Light of Destruction leave his body.
 Meanwhile, Zane leaves the island, and Chazz Duels a disguised  Blair Flannigan , and defeats her, crowning Chazz the champion of the Genex Tournment.
