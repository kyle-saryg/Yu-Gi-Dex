 Biography 
 Cody thinks that Duels are just about power, and when he was young he was bullied due to him being short. He saw the construction machines at a construction site and was impressed by how big and powerful they were. (In the dub version, his father is also a construction foreman, giving him more incentive.) He thought that he couldn't lose if he had the machines on his side, so he created a  Deck  around them.
 After his loss to  Yuma , he realized that Duels aren't all about power and that everything small is part of something bigger. He, along with Yuma and  Tori  fled the construction site after a worker saw them and asked them what they were doing there. [1] 
 
       Cody watches the finals of the WDC.
