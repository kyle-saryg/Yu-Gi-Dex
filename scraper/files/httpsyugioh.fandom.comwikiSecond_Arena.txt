      The Second Arena     
 The  Second Arena  was the name of the arena, where  Dark Yugi  faced  Mokuba Kaiba  in  Capsule Monster Chess , during  Death T -4.
 
 Design 
 The arena consists of a  Battle Box  suspended over a giant  Capsule Monster Chess  battlefield,  Garnaster's Border . There are three bridges connected to the Battle Box; one comes for Death T-3, one goes to Death T-5 and the last one is used by Mokuba to get to the box.
 The  Solid Vision  from the Battle Box causes giant holograms of the monsters to appear in the battlefield. Whoever loses the game in the Battle Box is to be subjected to  Seto Kaiba 's virtual reality recreation of the " Experience of Death "  Penalty Game .
 
 History 
 Dark Yugi faced Mokuba Kaiba here when he took part in Death T-4. Mokuba rigged the  Capsule Monster Chess  dispenser, to give himself high level monsters and give Yugi low level ones. Regardless, Yugi still managed to win.
 Seto inflicted the Penalty Game to Mokuba, despite being his brother. However, Yugi then returned to save Mokuba.
 
 Non-canon appearances 
 The  Kaiba Land  stage in  Yu-Gi-Oh! Destiny Board Traveler  consists of the Second Arena. The  Chopman  from  Death T-2  can be seen chained up in the corner.
