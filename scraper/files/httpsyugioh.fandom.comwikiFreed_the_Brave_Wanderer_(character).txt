 Biography 
 Freed led the  Steel Knight Army  in their quest to defend the civilian population of the  alternate dimension  against the Dark World Army. His headquarters was located in a hidden cave. After  Jaden Yuki  defeated  Scarr  and saved a young boy named  Kyle , Freed appeared and instructed Jaden's group to return to their sanctuary with them. Jaden's group took shelter there, but after hearing the dying words of  Larz , Jaden wished to continue on, as Larz claimed to have seen someone resembling  Jesse Anderson  at the prison camp. Freed told him not to leave until the sun rose, as leaving when the Dark World Army was active would compromise the location of their sanctuary.
 Despite this, Jaden rushed off. His friends ultimately followed him. Knowing his people were in danger, Freed took the opportunity to move the sanctuary's populace to a safer location, using Jaden as a decoy to distract the Dark World Army. He succeeded, and Jaden found himself in a desperate situation while Dueling  Zure . Freed arrived at the prison camp, and sacrificed the last of his energy to place his  card  on top of Jaden's  Deck . Jaden was able to win the Duel and defeat Zure with Freed's help. However, the card faded from existence as the Duel ended, and Freed died. Jaden vowed to save Freed's comrades as well as Jesse.
 Freed was seen one more time prior to Jaden's Duel with  Yubel , as Jaden remembered all the people Yubel has wronged.
