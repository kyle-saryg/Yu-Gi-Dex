 Summary 
 Introduction to Duel Monsters 
 At the  Kame Game ,  Sugoroku  introduces  Yugi 's friends,  Jonouchi  and  Anzu  to  Duel Monsters , a card game, which is currently popular in America. Unlike  standard playing cards ,  Duel Monsters  have a wide variety of card illustrations and contains thousands of different  Monster  and  Spell Cards .
 Anzu is impressed by some nice artwork, while she finds some of the others kinda gross. Jonouchi asks how to play and if it is anything like  Menko . (In the English version, he asks if it is like gambling). Yugi explains that it is a trading card game, involving two players, who each stake a card and the winner takes both cards. The game allows both players to be wizards, who can use their cards to cast spells or summon monsters to fight. All have different  Attack  and  Defense strengths . The first player to run out of  Life Points  loses. 
 As Yugi explains this an image of " Mystic Lamp " is shown in the background, with labels showing its name,  Level , illustration, Attack ( ATK ) and Defense ( DEF ) and mentioning that there's a prismatic corner stamp.
 Sugoroku says that there are both strong and weak cards, but with so many, one could never collect them all. He's heard of a fan in America, who sold his house just to buy 1 card. Sugoroku himself is fan enough to have 1 amazing card. He decides to show it to them, stating that it is his greatest treasure. He holds up the card, " Blue-Eyes White Dragon ". (In the English version, "Blue-Eyes White Dragon's"  Type  and lore are added.) He tells them that the "Blue-Eyes White Dragon" is so overpowered they stopped production, making it very valuable. In the Japanese version, he says that some people have been killed over it. In the English version, he says collectors would pay through their nose to get their hands on one.
 Jonouchi suggests that they play  Duel Monsters  at school tomorrow and Yugi gladly agrees. Jonouchi asks for a pack with plenty of strong ones, but Sugoroku laughs that you can't tell that until you open the pack.
 
 Kaiba's visit 
       Kaiba  ridicules  Jonouchi's  cards.     
 Seto Kaiba  enters the shop and sees they're talking about  Duel Monsters . Yugi recognizes Kaiba from their class. Jonouchi is glad to hear that Kaiba plays too and invites him to join them playing at school tomorrow. Kaiba laughs that Jonouchi isn't in his league and takes a look at his cards. He tosses them back at Jonouchi saying that they're useless and a beginner like Jonouchi could never match him. Kaiba boasts that he's good enough to compete at the national competition and since Jonouchi could never win against his Deck, playing against him would be pointless. He tells Jonouchi to come back, after he's collected at least 10,000 cards.
 Jonouchi starts to get mad and thinks to himself that he wouldn't lose in a real fight. Yugi tries to calm him down, saying he'll still play with Jonouchi.
 Kaiba turns to Sugoroku and asks if he has any good cards he might be persuaded to buy. Sugoroku says that he has and Kaiba notices the "Blue-Eyes White Dragon" on the counter. His hard beats and he starts to sweat, recognizing it as a legendary card. Sugoroku swipes the card back off he counter and Kaiba starts to question him, asking where he got the card, what it's doing here and demanding to have a look. Sugoroku agrees to let him have one look and hands him the card. Kaiba starts to stare at it in awe. He's never seen the card or ever thought that he'd actually hold one. The card is powerful and rare, he thinks, if he was to own it, he'd be invincible.
 
       Sugoroku  explains that he got the " Blue-Eyes White Dragon " from  a dear friend .     
 Sugoroku swipes the card back off of him, saying that's enough. Kaiba drops open a briefcase full of cards on the counter, offering to trade all of them for the "Blue-Eyes White Dragon". Yugi, Anzu and Jonouchi are surprised by both Kaiba offering that many cards and Sugoroku turning them down. It makes sense to Kaiba, he wouldn't trade the card for anything himself.
 Sugoroku says that he knows why Kaiba wants the card so much, however he has a good reason to hang onto it and it's not just because it's a strong card. An important gamer friend of his from America gave him the card. The card is as important to him as that friend, so he could never give it up. The same would be true if it was a common card. A picture of Sugoroku with  the friend  is visible behind him as he speaks to Kaiba. If you really treasure something, it grows a heart of its own and you would never trade anything for that heart, he explains and tells Kaiba to take care of every card in his briefcase and then he will find the true strength of this game. Kaiba slams his briefcase shut and walks out, saying he will get it later then.
 Jonouchi compliments Sugoroku on his speech and Yugi says that even without a rare card, his grandfather has never lost a game.
 
 School 
 Yugi faces against Jonouchi in a game of  Duel Monsters , while a large group of students, including  Anzu ,  Honda ,  Hanasaki  gather around them. Jonouchi  attacks  Yugi with " Zombie " and Yugi  defends  with another card.
 As they play, some of the basic rules of  Duel Monsters  are shown to the reader. They say that each player uses a Deck of 40 cards and starts with 2000  Life Points . They take turns drawing cards and play them in either  Attack  and  Defense Mode . When the defending player can't play a monster, the opponent's monsters  Attack Points  are deducted from their Life Points. When a player's Life Points reach 0, they lose. The Japanese version also includes the rules for calculating  damage  and determining which monsters are destroyed during battles.
 
         Kaiba switches the "Blue-Eyes White Dragon" for a  counterfeit .     
 Yugi starts his turn and  Summons  " Blackland Fire Dragon ". He uses it to  attack  and  destroy  "Zombie", dropping Jonouchi's Life Points from 2000 to 1500. Jonouchi starts to panic and says he'll use his secret weapon, but Yugi beats it too. After he loses, the other students laugh and Jonouchi and his secret weapon for being weak. Kaiba laughs to himself that that was such a low level Duel and even the elementary school students at the nationals are better than them.
 Kaiba addresses Yugi and tells him the Duel was fun to watch and asks if Yugi has the "Blue-Eyes White Dragon" in his schoolbag. Yugi is impressed and asks how Kaiba knew it was there. He says he begged his grandfather to lend it to him for one day, but had to promise not to play with it. Kaiba asks to be shown it one more time. Since he saw the card yesterday, he hasn't been able to sleep, he's been so excited, he tells Yugi and says that what his grandfather told him yesterday has taught him what it means to love the cards. Yugi agrees and to show it to him and hands Kaiba the card.
 Kaiba admires the card and quickly swaps it with a  counterfeit  he made. He hands back the counterfeit, thanking Yugi and saying that holding the card makes him love the game more. Kaiba tells them to have fun with their game and leaves. Yugi looks at him suspiciously, until Jonouchi calls him for a rematch.
 
 After school 
         Kaiba hits  Yugi , with his briefcase.     
 Kaiba leaves school, laughing that there's no way he'll lose the next tournament, but hears Yugi call after him. He worries slightly and asks Yugi if he's on his way home. Yugi asks Kaiba to give back the card. He didn't want to ask him earlier because everyone was watching, he explains. Kaiba acts innocent, asking if Yugi thinks he stole the card, and points out that he gave it back to him. Yugi says that he can tell the difference between a real and a fake and asks again for the card back. He tells Kaiba that the card is important to his grandfather and if he doesn't keep his promise and give him back the card, it'll break his heart. Kaiba still claims to have not taken it and asks Yugi about his own feelings; why doesn't he believe his friend before complaining about his grandfather? Yugi objects, causing Kaiba to lose his patience and hit him over the head with his briefcase.
 Kaiba states that he doesn't care about loving cards and stupid things like that and asks Yugi to tell his grandfather that it's not how you play the game, it's whether you win or lose.
 Yugi changes to  Dark Yugi , who says he must teach Kaiba a lesson with a  Shadow Game  and when he's done, he'll take back his grandfather's card.
 
 The Shadow Game 
         The  Duel Monsters  cards, brought to life.     
 Dark Yugi and Kaiba sit down at a table to play  Duel Monsters . Kaiba can't believe that Yugi challenged him to a game.
 Dark Yugi explains that the rules of this  Duel Monsters  game will be slightly different than what Kaiba's used to. Sounds like fun to Kaiba, but he doesn't think his cards will lose, no matter what house rules Dark Yugi has. Kaiba then thinks to himself, that if he ends-up in a pinch, he can use the stolen "Blue-Eyes White Dragon" and just tell Dark Yugi that he got it someplace else.
 Kaiba goes first and  draws  a  Level  5 monster " Ryu-Kishin ". As Kaiba  Summons  the card, a real monster emerges from it. Dark Yugi smiles, reminding Kaiba that he said the game would be different.
 Dark Yugi Summons " Blackland Fire Dragon " to battle "Ryu-Kishin". A real "Blackland Fire Dragon" emerges from the card and uses its flame breath to defeat the gargoyle. Kaiba observes his card disappearing. Dark Yugi tells him that the monsters become real and a  Penalty Game  awaits the loser; those are the rules of a  Shadow Game  of  Duel Monsters .

 Hiroto Honda ( Tristan Taylor  in the English version) also went to the game shop with Yugi, Jonouchi and Anzu ( Téa Gardner  in the English version).

 The picture of Sugoroku's friend is not shown. He does however appear in later episodes and is named Arthur Hopkins ( Arthur Hawkins  in the English version).

 Influences 
 The character  Seto Kaiba  is based on a collectable card games player that a friend of  Kazuki Takahashi  met. Takahashi's friend asked this person to teach him how to play a card game, but he replied "Hmph! Come back when you've collected 10,000 cards". The story made Takahashi mad, but thought the player would make a good character. Kaiba uses the man from the story's line about collecting 10,000 cards in this chapter. [1] 
 Yu-Gi-Oh!  had been a series of chapters, each with its own single storyline and featuring a different game in each story, up until this point.  Duel Monsters  proved to be largely popular, so Kazuki Takahashi decided to expand on it and base larger storylines on it.
 The position many monsters appeared in after being Summoned, including " Ryu-Kishin " and " Blackland Fire Dragon " were used by  Konami  as their artworks in the  OCG / TCG , rather than the artworks the cards had in the manga. The previous  Yu-Gi-Oh!  card game by Bandai  had used the artworks featured on the cards in the manga.
