 Biography 
       Ran in her  Turbo Duel  outfit.     
       Ran gets knocked into a rosebush after losing to Akiza in a Turbo Duel     
 Ran faced  Akiza Izinski  in a  Turbo Duel  in the hopes of taking her title, "Queen of Queens". However Akiza won and Ran toppled off her  Duel Runner  into a rose bush. She says that she'll get Akiza next time and Akiza accepts the challenge. [1]  Ran attended the  D1 Grand Prix  and watched Akiza's Duel against  Sherry LeBlanc . [2]  When Akiza's Turbo Duel with  Kalin Kessler  is about to begin, Ran is seen again alongside Akiza while they're waiting for Kalin to show up, with Ran wondering about why Akiza's opponent doesn't seen to show uo assuming he may be scared of Akiza's "Foresee Draw" ability. However, Kalin enters the scene right in the next moment, giving Akiza and Ran a sharp glare which Ran only comments her first impression of him as being a "quite dishy" one.  [3]  After that brief scene she's seen alongside  Mei  and  Sakura  in the audience a few panels throughout Akiza and Kalin's Turbo Duel and being shocked about the moves Kalin pulls off to block Akiza's attack and effect options in the duel. The three friends didn't lose their faith in Akiza though and kept cheering for her friend to motivate Akiza to do her best. However, Kalin's Zero Hand strategy overpowered Akiza and she lost the duel. Ran, Mei and Sakura are seen with tears in her eyes as they witnessed her friend's shocking defeat by the hands of Kalin Kessler.  [4] [5] 
 At some uncertain point during the second round of the D1 Grand Prix, while  Lazar  was about to defeat participating Turbo Duelists in order seal their souls into cards, Ran, Mei and Sakura fell victim to Lazar's soul stealing raid too. After  Rex Goodwin 's defeat in his Turbo Duel against  Jack Atlas  and when  Crow Hogan  managed to stop Lazar's actions by beating him in a Turbo Duel too, Lazar was forced to release all sealed souls which returned to their bodies once again, Ran, Mei and Sakura were seen regaining her souls alongside the other D1 duelists who's souls were sealed.  [6] 
 Ran next appeared after  Sect Ijuin  and  Yusei Fudo  thought their final Turbo Duel to save Sect from the Darkness of the  Ultimate God  and interrupted this being'S resurrection. Due to Yusei's victor Akiza was freed from her chain which were kept on here by the Ultimate God and Ran seemed to be happy to see Akiza is doing fine after what she'd been through.  [7]
