 Kanji Romanji Translation 
 雨の日も　風の日も　極寒の吹雪も　灼熱の太陽も 
全て日々を彩る材料　へこたれないで意思と愛を 
君がくれた　優しさは厳しさ 
ぶつかることで知った　もどかしさ 
違いを認めることで始まる　縦横無尽　踊れ　天地開闢 
 
本当はさびしかった　君に会うまでは 
ひとりでいるほうが気楽なんだって　うそついていた 
 
好きな本も　趣味も　まるであわないけど 
君だけだよ　うなずいてくれたのは 
 
喜びと　悲しみと　怒りと 
ドと　レと　ミと　ファと　ソと　ラと　シと　ド 
違わなきゃ出来ない　ハーモニーとシナリオ 
 
誰も同じじゃない 
それこそが生きてる意味だから 
時として出した音が　不協和音でも 
だからあきらめない　信じぬける強さで 
辿り着ける世界の果てで　君と見る景色が真実なんだ 
 
雨の日も　風の日も　極寒の吹雪も　灼熱の太陽も 
全て日々を彩る材料　へこたれないで意思と愛を 
君がくれた　優しさは厳しさ 
ぶつかることで知った　もどかしさ 
 
違いを認めることで始まる　縦横無尽　踊れ　天地開闢

 Whether it's Stormy, Windy, Misty, or Hot 
Always be strong, and show me what you got 
You were kind but strict, at first I became irritated 
We're different, yet this is the wonder heavens have created 
 
The thing is before we met I was really lonely 
I felt better off like this, but always thought "If only..." 
Everything I liked and loved, for others it didn't make any sense 
You're the only one who understood me without any pretence 
 
whether we're sad or Happy....(What we understand, What we feel) 
Different, but in Harmony....(It is all real). 
 
No one is exactly the same 
We must be proud to be different from the others 
Sometimes there is dissonance, this may result in a strife 
Don't give up on the strength that will get you through 
Towards the truth in the blue sky we glide 
At this Final moment we'll be right at each other's side 
 
Whether it's Stormy, Windy, Misty, or Hot 
Always be strong, and show me what you got 
You were kind but strict, at first I became irritated 
We're different, yet this is the wonder heavens have created

 Whether it's rainy, or windy, or a cold winter blizzard, or the burning sun, 
They're all ingredients to color each day. Don't lose heart, will or love. 
The kindness you gave me was strict, when we clashed I learned irritation. 
It starts by recognizing our differences, dancing freely, the creation of heaven and earth. 
 
The truth is, I was lonely. Until I met you. 
I lied to myself that being alone was easier. 
My favorite books and hobbies, they don't seem to match, 
You were the only one to nod in agreement with me. 
 
Happiness and sadness and anger and Do and Re and Mi and Fa and So and La and Ti and Do, 
It doesn't work unless they're different, the harmony and the scenario. 
 
No one is exactly the same, 
Because that's the reason for living. 
Even if the sounds are dissonant from time to time, 
Don't give up on the strength that will get you through. 
When we reach the edge of the world, 
The view we see will be the truth. 
 
In truth, I was searching, until I met you. 
For something near the palm of my hand that reached out to connect. 
Fighting with you is scary. 
But I want to laugh with you from the bottom of my heart. 
 
Red and blue and yellow and black and white and space and earth and sea and sky. 
It can't be seen unless they're different, the landscape and the scenario. 
 
Nobody is ever truly alone. 
If I repeat each story over and over. 
The seasons change, so even if lost. 
With this strength we believe in, we'll never separate our hands. 
Walking on, in the middle of this journey 
The scenery I see with you will be the truth. 
 
Go with the Limited Speed, Knock. 
The promises we exchanged on that day. 
Remember? The dream we talked about. 
In the unfading Wonderful Days. 
 
As I stepped out to the way the sun shines. 
Together, we've spilled bitter tears. 
I fight it while I come against it every day. 
Laugh and even facing adversity, win it easily. 
 
Gradually, our determination will become strong 
Cultivating our soul. 
With my feet planted, I'll stand up. 
Thank you for giving me the sun. 
 
We will always be connected. 
We live on the same earth. 
Let's join together, piece by piece. 
It shines into a masterpiece 
 
Even if we spend the same night and morning, our feelings may be different. 
The important thing is that we're always looking at the same sky. 
 
No one is exactly the same, 
Because that's the reason for living. 
Even if the sounds are dissonant from time to time, 
Don't give up on the strength that will get you through. 
When we reach the edge of the world, 
The view we see will be the truth. 
 
The view we see will be the truth. 
 
Whether it's rainy, or windy, or a cold winter blizzard, or the burning sun, 
They're all ingredients to color each day. Don't lose heart, will or love. 
The kindness you gave me was strict, when we clashed I learned irritation. 
 
It starts by recognizing our differences, dancing freely, the creation of heaven and earth.
