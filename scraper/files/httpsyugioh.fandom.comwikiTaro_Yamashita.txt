 Personality 
 Taro is quite an eccentric person who believes in himself and his team, even when in the darkest situations. He also believes in all cards, even though they're not rare, as seen when  Jinbei Tanigawa  commented that the only  Duel Monsters  cards he could find were weak, common,  Normal Monsters  to which Taro defended them, saying they all have potential.
 
 Biography 
 History 
 Taro along with the rest of his team lived outside of the cities of Japan in a farming area where their families run a vineyard for a living. Taro found out about the  WRGP  from a news article and asked his friends about entering to which they laughed at the idea. Then as time progressed, Taro managed to turn them into wanting to, but Jinbei clearly pointed out that none of them have neither a  Duel Runner  nor  Decks . From this, everyone began to search for cards and Duel Runner parts in order to enter.
 Taro also appeared when Jinbei go in trouble with a gang. He along with Yoshizo hid behind some bushes and made sound effects of security in order to make the gang members drive off. When the boss saw them, they rescued Jinbei and managed to escape, racing to the top of a hill, to watch the sun rise to which their team name derived from.
 When all three managed to find the pieces to enter the WRGP, Jinbei and Yoshizo's parents were against the idea stating that Taro's father backing them up on the idea is insane, but they submitted when their children stated how much they would like to attend the WRGP. From here, they left for the WRGP.
 
 World Racing Grand Prix 
 Taro first appeared when  Leo  was running to tell Yusei about  Team Ragnarok , to which when he ran across a road, running in front of  Yoshizo Hayashi  whilst he was practicing on his  Duel Runner . After his Duel with Yusei, the  Divine Temple  appears in the sky.
 
 Deck 
 Taro's Turbo Deck is based around  Summoning  " Zushin the Sleeping Giant " through the use of the WRGP rules of his teammates passing  Level  1  Normal Monsters  on to him. He also makes heavy use of the burn effect of " Speed World 2 ". Most of his cards involve supporting "Zushin" and inflicting  effect damage .
 He is the only Duelist in history to have successfully Summoned "Zushin".
