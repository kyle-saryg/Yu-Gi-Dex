This means that in an  Advanced Format  duel, we have to use  Proto-Cyber Dragon  (and possibly other cards that can change their name to  Cyber Dragon ) in order to  Fusion Summon   Cyber Twin Dragon  or  Cyber End Dragon , since only one  Cyber Dragon  is allowed and neither of those  fusion  monsters accept substitutes.

 Actually, no, it's now impossible to summon those monsters because Proto-Cyber Dragon counts towards the 1-per-deck limit.  Zeldafanjtl  ( talk  |  contribs ) 19:17, 24 July 2009 (UTC) 
 Absolutely incorrect. Proto-Cyber Dragon's effect applies only on the field, not in the deck like the Harpie Ladies.  Runer5h  19:37, 24 July 2009 (UTC)Runer5h 
 I think konami should add more  Cyber Dragon  support card because of the limitation of  Cyber Dragon , now, we have to rely on  Proto-Cyber Dragon  and we can only fusion summon the Chimeratechs, not  Cyber Twin Dragon  or  Cyber End Dragon ,  Cyber Twin Dragon  has a chance of 50% being summoned but  Cyber End Dragon  will just have 15% chance.-- 33royward  00:33, 15 August 2009 (UTC)
