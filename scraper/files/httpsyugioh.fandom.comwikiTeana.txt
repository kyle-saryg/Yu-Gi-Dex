 Biography 
 Teana first appears in the Dueling Grounds dueling the Prince. She tells him of a festival occurring in the Plaza, and they leave to see it. They watch the mages march around a shrine, holding flags. She comments that the ceremonies are starting to seem darker, assuming that it is the work of the "detestable" high mage  Heishin . She spots  Jono  dueling, and greets him just before the mage  Seto , defeats him. Seto mocks Jono's dueling skills but Jono and Teana tell him that The Prince could easily defeat him. Seto is however summoned and cannot duel the Prince. Teana, Jono, and the Prince return to the Dueling Grounds where she loses to the Prince in a friendly duel.
 When Jono leads the Prince to the Hidden Dueling grounds after his return to Ancient Egypt, Teana challenges the Prince to a friendly duel. She is later kidnapped by Seto but is rescued by The Prince and Jono. She thanks the boys for rescuing her.
