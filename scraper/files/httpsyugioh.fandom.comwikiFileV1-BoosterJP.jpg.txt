 Vol.1 , short for  Volume 1 , is a  Booster Pack  that was released on February 4,  1999 [1]  as the first set in the  Yu-Gi-Oh! Official Card Game . Like all  Series 1  sets,  Vol.1  cards used the  Series 1 card layout , distinguished from later layouts by the lack of a  Card Number  beneath the card's artwork and the  Eye of Anubis Hologram  in its lower-right corner.
 In addition to being the first set in the  OCG ,  Vol.1  introduced two cards that were not in the  Bandai  series. All but 15 cards have been reprinted in Japanese, and all but seven of them have been printed in the  Yu-Gi-Oh! Trading Card Game .
