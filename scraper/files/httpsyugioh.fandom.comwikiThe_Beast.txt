 Greiger 
 
 The Beast  (unnamed in the Japanese version) is  Greiger 's  Duel Runner . 
 The Beast  is the largest known Duel Runner and is modeled after a dragster. A large skull is mounted on the front. A set of back tires are detachable, in order to reveal a set of blades mounted on each axle, similar to a war chariot. It also has a very loud engine, which caused Yusei to lose concentration during the Duel.
 
       The Beast  redesigned.     
 After becoming a Dark Signer, Greiger redesigned The Beast for  Shadow Turbo Duels , making it more powerful than before. He included a new design featuring geoglyph patterns and a new set of spiked axles. It was crushed by falling debris after Greiger rammed it into the  Blackbird  to save  Crow . 
 After Greiger is revived back to his normal self, he gets a  new Duel Runner .
