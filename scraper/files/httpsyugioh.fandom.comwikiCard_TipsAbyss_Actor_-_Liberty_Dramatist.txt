 This card's monster effect will only trigger with the desired outcome of triggering the searched " Abyss Script " Spell Card's effect if Special Summoned by its  Pendulum Effect , and even then, it requires setting up your  Extra Deck  with a face-up " Abyss Actor " monster. "Abyss Actor - Extras" is the easiest means of achieving this setup.
 Ideally, apply this card's Pendulum Effect when your own monster attacks. Although this may mean your opponent takes less damage from the resulting  replayed  attack, it also gives them fewer opportunities to remove your search target by non-destruction means before the end of the turn. You can also apply the effect of a monster that  activates when it destroys a monster by battle  ( without  sending it to the Graveyard), especially " Abyss Actor - Evil Heel ". 
 You can guarantee searching a specific "Abyss Script" Spell Card by choosing three copies of it from your Deck.
