 Major Events 
 Yami Yugi and Seto Kaiba work together to duel 2 Rare Hunters in order to get past them. 
 Joey Wheeler finds Mako Tsunami and decides to duel him for the prize of 2 locator cards to go directly to the finals, since both already have 4  Locator cards 
 Marik Ishtar and Yami Bakura meet each other and make a deal to work together to win their respective goals. 
 Featured Duels 
 Yami Yugi and Seto Kaiba vs. Rare Hunter 2 and Rare Hunter 3 
 Turn 1: Kaiba 
 Kaiba  draws " Pot of Greed " and subsequently  activates  it to draw two cards. Seto then  Normal Summons  " Lord of Dragons " (1200/1100) in  Attack Position . Next he activates two " The Flute of Summoning Dragon " to  Special Summon  three " Blue-Eyes White Dragons " (3000/2500) and " Hyozanryu " (2100/2800) in Attack Position (each "The Flute of Summoning Dragon" Special Summons two Dragons from Kaiba's hand).
 Turn 2: Rare Hunter 2 
 Rare Hunter 2  draws a monster and subsequently sets it. 
 Turn 3: Yami Yugi 
 Yugi  draws. He then  Sets  two cards (" Mystical Refpanel " and " Multiply ") and Normal Summons " Kuriboh " (300/200) in  Defense Position .
 Turn 4: Rare Hunter 3 
 Rare Hunter 3  draws " Mirror Force " and subsequently  Sets  it. He then Sets a monster.
 Turn 5: Seto 
Seto draws "Obelisk the Tormentor". He then  tributes  his three "Blue-Eyes White Dragons" in order to  Tribute Summon  " Obelisk the Tormentor " (4000/4000) in  Attack Position . Kaiba then activates the second effect of "Obelisk the Tormentor" to destroy all of the Rare Hunters' monsters and inflict 4000 damage to the Rare Hunters by Tributing "Hyozanryu" and "Lord of Dragons". Rare Hunter 3 tries to activate "Mirror Force" in response, but it doesn't work due to Obelisk being immune to Spells and Traps (Rare Hunter 2 and Rare Hunter 3 4000 → 0).
 
 Joey Wheeler vs. Mako Tsunami, Part 1 
 Turn 1: Joey 
 Joey  draws " Parasite Paracide ", forgetting he had it in his Deck still. Thinking he can use it to infect Mako's monsters, he  Sets  it.
 Turn 2: Mako 
 Mako  draws " Flying Fish " and subsequently Normal Summons it (800/500) in  Attack Position . "Flying Fish"  attacks  and destroys  Joey's   Set   monster , "Parasite Paracide" (500/300). Since Joey has no monsters to Tribute, the  Flip Effect  of "Parasite Paracide" doesn't  activate . (In the real game, " Parasite Paracide " doesn't need a tribute to work, but, if it didn't survive the battle, its Flip Effect wouldn't activate. Needing a tribute was presumably done for comedic effect.)
 Turn 3: Joey 
 Joey  draws. He then  Sets  a  monster .
 Turn 4: Mako 
 Mako  draws. He then  Sets  a card.
 Turn 5: Joey 
 Joey  draws "Garoozis". He then  Tributes  his  Set   monster  in order to  Tribute Summon  " Garoozis " (1800/1500) in  Attack Position , but  Mako   activates  his face-down " Torrential Tribute " to  destroy  "Garoozis".
 Turn 6: Mako 
Mako draws. "Flying Fish"  attacks  directly (Joey 4000 → 3200). Mako then sets one card.
 Turn 7: Joey 
 Joey  draws. He then  Normal Summons  " Alligator's Sword " (1500/1200) in Attack Position. He then  Sets  two cards.
 Turn 8: Mako 
 Mako  draws "Amphibian Beast". He then  Tributes  "Flying Fish" in order to  Tribute Summon  " Amphibian Beast " (2400/2000) in  Attack Position . "Amphibian Beast"  attacks  "Alligator's Sword", but  Joey   activates  his face-down " Fairy Box " which places "Alligator's Sword" in a whack-a-monster box, therefore "Amphibian Beast" can't attack right away.  Mako  counters by  activating  his set " Umi ", which increases the ATK and DEF of all Fish, Sea Serpent, Thunder, and Aqua-Type monsters by 200 ("Amphibian Beast": 2400 → 2600/ 2000 → 2200). 
 The activation of "Umi" also raises the water level above the top of "Fairy Box", suffocating "Alligator's Sword" and preventing him from hiding inside the box. "Amphibian Beast" continues with its attack, but  Joey   activates  his face-down " Skull Dice " to roll a die and divide the ATK of "Amphibian Beast" by the result. Joey gets a four ("Amphibian Beast": 2600 → 650/2200). "Alligator's Sword"  destroys  "Amphibian Beast" (Mako 4000 → 3300).
 Duel concludes next episode. 
 
 Differences in adaptations 
 The Japanese text on the advertisement for the Ocean World show is blocked in the dub. 
 A shot of the aquarium entrance with a big sign reading "Domino Aquarium" is replaced in the US Version with an overhead shot of the aquarium. 
 When  Joey  thinks of his own ocean, an image of  Yami Yugi  appears, the image of  Yami Yugi  appearing is cut from the dub. 
 Rare Hunter 3  says the card he's setting is a trap card while playing his " Mirror Force ", which is not the case in the original anime. 
 In the original, Mako claimed that the Flip Effect of "Parasite Paracide" didn't work because Joey has no monsters to Tribute. In the dub, he claimed it was because "Parasite Paracide" was destroyed by battle. 
 Errors 
 Kaiba is shown to have cards in his hand in various shots after playing all of his cards and before drawing "Obelisk". 
 Yugi is shown to have one extra card in his hand throughout the duel (as if he had played " Pot of Greed " too). 
 In several shots, "Pot of Greed" is seen on Kaiba's Duel Disk instead of " The Lord Of Dragons ". 
 In the dub, when "Obelisk" is summoned, Rare Hunter 2 and Rare Hunter 3's facedown monsters are shown as " Giant Trunade " and " Jellyfish ", respectively. 
 When "Obelisk" attacks the Rare Hunters' facedown monsters, the god card is shown to destroy the taller Rare Hunter's defense monster and trap card, instead of both Rare Hunters' defense monsters. However, in the next scene, both of those monsters are gone and the Rare Hunter activates his trap card. 
 When Mako sets his "Torrential Tribute" trap card, he mistakenly said he places a "monster" facedown. 
 When Mako attacks after using "Torrential Tribute" the card shown on his Duel Disk is not "Flying Fish" it is "Torrential Tribute". 
 When "Alligator's Sword" was first summoned out, the bottom part of its mouth was incorrectly colored green. 
 In the original, when "Skull Dice" divided the ATK of " Amphibian Beast " by 4, it reduced its ATK to 800 when it should have been 650. The dub corrected this. However both versions have Mako's Life Points decrease to 3300 (which would be the difference between the ATK of "Alligator's Sword" and the reduced ATK of "Amphibian Beast" in the original) when they should have been reduced to 3150.
