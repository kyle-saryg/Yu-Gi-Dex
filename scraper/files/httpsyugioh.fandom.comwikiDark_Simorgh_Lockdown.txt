 This deck is considered a  Classic Deck , this page is used to tell the history of a deck rather than how it is played now. This can happen either from mechanics of the game changing, changes from the "TCG" or "OCG" Forbidden/Limited List, or the deck has slowly lost it's ability to be played over time due to years of no support or neglect. 
 
         
 Dark Simorgh Lockdown  Decks use " Dark Simorgh " to prevent the opponent from activating Traps and Monster Flip Effects. " Anti-Spell Fragrance " is usually incorporated, as it forces the opponent to  Set   Spell Cards  before use, and since "Dark Simorgh" prevents the opponent from setting any cards, they won't be able to use Spell Cards or Trap Cards at all.
 Being unable to Set monsters to defend, the opponent's only escape from this lock would be defeating "Dark Simorgh" in battle or using monster effects to destroy your locking cards. For this reason, cards such as " My Body as a Shield ", " Forbidden Chalice " and " Divine Wrath " are recommended.

 Special Summoning Dark Simorgh 
 Special Summoning  " Dark Simorgh " from your hand requires a  DARK  and a  WIND  monster in your Graveyard. Typically, similar styles of deck (Vayu Turbo and " Chaos "-based Decks) use " Ryko, Lightsworn Hunter ", " Charge of the Light Brigade ", and " Lyla, Lightsworn Sorceress ". However, since "Dark Simorgh" doesn't require  LIGHT  monsters, these can actually slow down the summoning of "Simorgh" if used in large quantities (so you should minimize the number of "Lightsworns" used).
 Special Summoning "Dark Simorgh" from your  Graveyard  requires a DARK and a WIND monster in your hand, Similar to the way " Machina Fortress " Special Summons itself from the Graveyard by using monster cards from your hand.
 Another option for Special Summoning "Dark Simorgh" is to combine the more powerful WIND archetypes (Such as " Dragunity ", " Harpie " and " Mist Valley ") with the more powerful DARK archetypes (Such as " Blackwing " and " Dark World "). In addition to that " Destiny Draw " and the " Destiny HERO " cards can be used effectively in a "Dark Simorgh" deck.
 Special Summoning "Dark Simorgh" from your  Deck  can easily be done by Normal summoning  Ninja Grandmaster Hanzo  and adding  Ninjitsu Art of Transformation  to your hand.
 
 Dragunitywing Simorgh 
 "Blackwings" and "Dragunities" combine well due to "Dragon Ravine". You can use " Blackwing - Blizzard the Far North " to Special Summon discarded "Blackwing" monsters and then remove "Blizzard" for "Dark Simorgh". Using "Blackwings" lets you use " Delta Crow - Anti Reverse " to get rid of your opponent's set Spell and Trap Cards before you summon Simorgh in order to stop your opponent from getting rid of him with a set Trap Card.

 Black Harpies Simorgh 
 Combining " Blackwings " with " Harpies " in one deck is a good idea for a Dark Simorgh deck as "Harpies" are WIND monsters and "Blackwings" are DARK monsters. It also helps with "Harpie's Hunting Ground" being around to have an easy way of disposing any set traps your opponent may have before summoning "Dark Simorgh"  
 In this type of deck Simorgh functions as more of a beatstick than a lockdown tool.

 Ninja Simorgh 
 Using  Ninja  monsters with a simorgh lockdown is easy thanks to  Ninjitsu Art of Transformation . It allows you to  Tribute  any  Level  4 ninja monster in order to summon Simorgh from your  Deck . You can use  Ninja Grandmaster Hanzo  to search for  Ninjitsu Art of Transformation , and to search for other ninja, as well as being a  DARK  monster.
Using  Masked Ninja Ebisu  You can return Spell and Trap cards on your opponent's side of the field to their hand, which works perfectly with The Simorgh-lockdown's Concept, Also being a  WIND  monster. You can also add  Ninjitsu Art of Super-Transformation  to summon  White Dragon Ninja , and use  Safe Zone  as well to complete the lockdown, and avoid getting your monsters destroyed by battle at all, and render your opponent's traps and spells useless.
 Since this deck uses a lot of  Continuous Trap Cards , one copy of  Uria, Lord of Searing Flames  can be added to the deck for a powerful monster that could beat the opponent's monsters and deal a lot of damage. Also, it can destroy the opponent's set trap, and spell cards, in case any were set before you could summon your simorgh.

 Mistwing Simorgh 
 Using " Mist Valley " monsters for a return engine and " blackwings " to swarm, your opponent will have a rough time keeping their monsters on the field. One combo is to use " Anti-Spell Fragrance " and " Mist Valley Falcon " together so you don't have to set your spells.
 This deck has a high synchro rate so you'll have plenty DARK and WIND monsters in the graveyard. You might want to include " My Body as a Shield " to protect them from spells and monster effects.
