 Summary 
 Reunion 
       Yusei and Jack's reunion.     
 After crossing the pipeline, Yusei arrives in  New Domino . Here he meets Jack. In the Japanese version, Jack asks how long has it been, to which Yusei replies, "Two years". Jack admires Yusei's new  Duel Runner , saying he's built quite the Duel Runner, that's not surprising. Yusei reminds Jack that he stole the first one he built, after all. Jack smiles, saying that a King never lets a chance slip by. Yusei asks where it is and Jack tells him it's obviously already broken. Yusei clenches a fist. He's slightly upset but calmly asks about his card. Jack holds up the card " Stardust Dragon " and Yusei tells him it was part of their friends in  Satellite  and their dreams. Jack looks down upon Yusei for still pondering on that "childish nonsense". Now that he is King he no longer needs the card, he says. In the English version Jack says that he hopes  Trudge  wasn't too much on an inconvenience, he was just doing what he's paying him to do. He then asks what brings Yusei here. With a tone of demand, Yusei replies that he wants his "Stardust Dragon" card back. Jack asks about the Runner, but Yusei hotly responds that he doesn't need it and asks how its running. Jack states that Yusei never could never let go of anything. Yusei replies that he never was one to forgive and forget. Jack tries Yusei's patience by asking if he wants to catch up on old times, as Yusei continues to demand "Stardust Dragon". Jack holds up the card. Disgusted, Yusei asks how could he to which replies that he couldn't leave it in the hands of losers. Not satisfied, Yusei reminds him how it was the only hope their friends had of getting out of the Satellite. It was meant to help them all. It certainly helped him, Jack says.
 Jack then throws it down to Yusei. Yusei stares at the card and shuts his eyes for a second. In the Japanese version, Jack asks what's wrong and tells him to put it back in his Deck. In the English version he asks if Yusei's having second thoughts. Yusei throws it back. In the Japanese version, he says that he'll get it back in a Duel and that he bets Jack had the same thing in mind. In the English version, Yusei says that he wants the card, but he also wants Jack to pay for what he did and when he beats him, he'll take the card back. Jack agrees and they head to a Duel stadium.
 On the way Jack shows Yusei the skyscrapers of New Domino. In the Japanese version he tells Yusei how the city never sleeps and continues to grow, and that he will continue to rule as King. In the English version he describes how it's a step up from Satellite.
 
 Goodwin, Zigzix, Mina and Lazar 
       Zigzix's demonstration.     
 Meanwhile  Zigzix  energetically gives a presentation to  Rex Goodwin  about the benefits of  Ener-D . In the Japanese he pauses to catch his breath and Goodwin calmly explains that he understands his love of Momentum, but insists that he get to the point. He sent for them that late at night because he had something important to tell them. In the English Goodwin gets impatient with Zigzix and tells him to get to the point before he decides to replace him. Zigzix shows him a screen and says that at  Kaiba Corporation's  Ener-D Research and Development Department, they had finaly completed the New Domino City Absolute Momentum Project. In the Japanese he says, this will give New Domino the mightiest of all energies and wisdom of god himself. He is interrupted by Goodwin grunting and greatly tones down his excitement and says Goodwin has all the details by looking at the project documentation. In the English, he says it will make them the masters of the universe, before correcting himself and saying it will make Goodwin the master of the universe. They are interrupted by  Mina  who whispers something to Goodwin, causing him to have to leave Zigzix early.
 
       Goodwin, Lazar and Mina watch the Duel.     
 Mina informs Goodwin about Jack and Yusei's encounter. Goodwin says that it cannot become known that Jack was in contact with a Satellite resident, it would be bad for his reputation. Mina begins to tell Goodwin what happened, but he scolds her for making excuses. In the Japanese Goodwin seizes Mina by the jaw.
 Together they meet  Lazar  who shows them a live recording of Yusei and Jack meeting at the Duel Stadium. In the Japanese Lazar asks if they should contact Security but Goodwin says it hasn't come to that yet. In the English Lazar points out how it's illegal to duel against Satellite residents. Goodwin says he wants to see how Jack handles this, but keep the guards on standby.
 
 
 The Duel 
 In the Japanese version: Jack tells Yusei that as King he must defend his throne and attacking is much easier than defending. He adds "Stardust Dragon" to his Deck saying that Yusei's chance to get it back is as good as lost and Yusei has made a foolish choice. In the English he describes the stadium being full of fans chanting your name and tells Yusei that's not something he's going to experience, because after this Duel, only his loser friends in Satellite will be cheering them, provided they don't leave him when he returns without "Stardust Dragon". He continues to tease Yusei about how his friends will react after he tells them he had the card, but gave it back to get a chance to duel Jack. He finally insists Yusei will regret coming here, after he beats him with his own card, as he slides it into his Deck.
 In the English version: While they duel, after Yusei makes a move, he reminds Jack how he used the same move to save him from  Sector Security  before. Jack tells Yusei that was a setup, to get him closer to taking his Duel Runner and the "Stardust Dragon" card. With Yusei on the offense and Jack on the defense, the Duel seems evenly matched until Jack summons his " Multiple Piece Golem " and uses its effect to swarm the field with smaller "Golem" monsters. He also Summons Tuner monsters, and uses them and the "Golem" monsters to bring out "Stardust Dragon" and " Red Dragon Archfiend " at the same time.

 Differences in adaptions 
 In the Japanese version, while showing Yusei the skyscrapers, Jack tells Yusei how the city never sleeps and continues to grow; And that he will continue to rule as King. In the English version he describes how it's a step up from Satellite. 
 The stadium that Yusei and Jack are dueling in is called the Kaiba Dome in the English version. Its name was not mentioned in the Japanese version. 
 In the English version, Jack says the he hopes  Trudge  wasn't too much on an inconvenience, he just doing what he's paying him to do. In the Japanese version, Jack shows no authority over Ushio (Trudge) and this line did not exist. 
 In the Japanese, Goodwin tolerates Akutsu's ( Zigzix's ) wild behavior. In the English version, he becomes impatient over it. 
 In the Japanese version, when Mikage ( Mina ) said she tried to stop Jack, Goodwin seizes her by the jaw, after which she apologies. This scene was cut from the English version. 
 In the English dub, when Yusei Summons " Junk Synchron ", he  activates  its  effect  to bring back " Quillbolt Hedgehog ". In the original, he activates the effect of "Quillbolt Hedgehog" instead. 
 
 
 Trivia 
 In the original Japanese airing, when Jack summons Stardust Dragon, it's moving down. This is changed on the Japanese DVD to show Stardust moving up, and that's the version 4Kids dubbed. 
 Errors 
 There are inconsistencies with the cards in Yusei's hand whenever it is shown. The first shot shows Yusei's hand containing "Shield Warrior", "Graceful Revival", and "Defense Draw" in his hand, but the next time Yusei's hand is shown, it shows that those three cards were replaced with "Ghost Gardna", "Counterattack Beacon", and "Meteor Stream". Also Yusei draws "Spacegate" on the fifth turn, but by process of elimination that should have been "Defense Draw". 
 In the English dub, when Jack's Life Points drop due to the direct attack made by "Junk Warrior", the wrong counter is used. Instead of a Life Point counter, it is a monster's Attack Point counter.
