 Features 
 Dark Beginning 1  is the first  reprint  set in the TCG, containing the Japanese sets  Duelist Legacy Volume.1 ,  Duelist Legacy Volume.2 , and the first "half" of  Duelist Legacy Volume.3  (i.e., most cards from  LOB - LON ). It contains all 5 pieces of " Exodia the Forbidden One ", as well as many other cards with decreased rarity. Also, it contains a few cards never before seen in boosters. 
 
 Cards 1 to 66 are from  Spell Ruler . 
 Cards 67 to 95 and 171 to 203 are from  Pharaoh's Servant . 
 Cards 98 to 139 are from  Legend of Blue Eyes White Dragon .
 The alternate artworks for " Blue-Eyes White Dragon ", " Dark Magician ", and " Red-Eyes Black Dragon " originated from the Power of Chaos video game series. 
 Cards 140 to 168 are from  Metal Raiders . 
 Cards 204 to 250 are from  Labyrinth of Nightmare . 
 Cards 96 and 170 were originally video game promos. 
 " Big Shield Gardna " and " Makyura the Destructor " are unique to this set. 
 Designed for beginners, every pack has 12 cards—instead of the normal 9—and a " Tip Card ", which has a special tip to increase your game knowledge.  Dark Beginning  (and all other  Reprint  Packs) always contain 6  Monster Cards , 3  Trap Cards , 3  Spell Cards , 1  Tip Card  and 1 or even 2 rares.
 Yugi Muto 's appearance on the cover of this booster pack is taken from the title page for  Yu-Gi-Oh! Millennium World  Duel 47: " The Silent Duelist!! " .
