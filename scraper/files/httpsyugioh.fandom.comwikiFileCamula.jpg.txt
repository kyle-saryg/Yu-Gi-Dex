 Design 
 Appearance 
       Camula's Lineart. Her design incorporates a wide range of expressions. Depicted here is the  Shadow Rider  in full regalia from front, side and rear alongside views of her head from different angles.     
 Camula's character design was overseen by Kenichi Hara. Her usual outfit consists of a long dress, displaying her cleavage with long slits revealing the side of her legs, straps crossing her arms just below her shoulders attached to a cape and bat broaches below her cleavage and above the slits, gold armbands and bracelets on both arms and heeled shoes with laces continuing up her shins. 
 She has long straight green waist length hair with one large curl above her forehead and yellow eyes. She wears her own exclusive Shadow Rider  Duel Disk  with  Monster Card Zones  in the shape of bat's wings on her left arm.
 
 Etymology 
 Her name comes from  Carmilla , a vampire story that predates Bram Stoker's  Dracula . It was first published in 1872, printed in a magazine called  Dark Blue .
 
 Biography 
 Centuries ago in Middle Age Europe, Camula was a member of the proud vampire race that lived in isolation from humanity, but seeing how humans see them as monsters, they were exterminated by them. Camula had managed to survive until the present day by sealing herself inside a coffin. She awoke much later when  Kagemaru  uncovered it and invited her to join the  Shadow Riders .
 She captures the souls of her opponents within dolls, following their losses to fuel her cause, and uses the  Shadow Charm  choker around her neck to bet the souls of others in conjunction with the  Shadow Game -exclusive " Illusion Gate ", a powerful card that requires her to give a soul to the  Sacred Beasts , to ensure victory. Using the souls that she captures, she will resurrect her vampire brethren, and take their revenge on the humans that feared and despised them.
 Camula arrives on  Duel Academy  to obtain the keys and to make up for  Nightshroud / Atticus Rhodes ' failure. She manages to obtain the keys from  Vellian Crowler  and  Zane Truesdale  (thanks to information about their cards and strategies from her bats). While the latter had proved to be a far more challenging opponent, the threat of taking  Syrus Truesdale 's soul caused him to surrender and lose. Though she was only interested in obtaining a doll of Zane, she duels  Jaden Yuki  due to Jaden wanting to save Crowler and Zane. However, her Shadow Charm's power is negated by the completed  Shadow Charm  item that Jaden possesses. 
 Out of over self-confidence, Camula places her own soul on the line (whereas in the original, she does not have a choice because the card was already  activated ). Jaden however was able to summon forth a new Elemental HERO - Shining Flare Wingman . Shocked, Camula states she has never seen Jaden have this monster as her bats never told her about this. Jaden then states he decided to counteract the darkness with the light as the recent duels lately were in darkness. Camula is defeated by Jaden's "Elemental Hero Shining Flare Wingman" and because of "Illusion Gate", Camula loses her soul. it is dragged into the " Gate " by a spiritual claw after she loses, leaving her body an empty husk, which crumbles into dust. In the English dub, the part with the spiritual claw going into her back to rip out her soul is edited out.
