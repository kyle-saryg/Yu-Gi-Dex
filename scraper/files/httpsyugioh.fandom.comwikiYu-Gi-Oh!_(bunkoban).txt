 Edits 
 Cards whose stats changed between appearances, such as " Dark Magician ", " King of Yamimakai " and " Helpoemer ", are changed to remain consistent between appearances. 
 Keith Howard 's  okama yarō  (オカマ 野 郎 ) insult directed at  Pegasus  is changed to  Pegasus-chan  (ペガサスちゃん).  Okama yarō  is a derogatory term for homosexual, cross-dressing or effeminate men.  Chan  is a term of endearment, which depending on context, is considered condescending when used to refer to adults. 
 The spelling "Black Crown" is corrected to " Black Clown ". 
 In  Seto Kaiba 's vision,  Seto 's clothing and  Kisara 's hair are changed to match their appearance later in the series, the stone slab is less jagged and Seto is looking at Kisara, rather than the slab. 
 A scene is added after Bobasa takes  Yugi Mutou  and his friends to Yugi's  soul room ; Yugi,  Anzu ,  Jonouchi  and  Honda  lie unconscious on the floor.  Dark Bakura  approaches them and takes the  Millennium Puzzle , while an apparition of  Shadi  observes. 
 Some scenes are added after Seto has Kisara moved to a different room; Akhenaden goes to Kisara's old cell and murders the guard on duty and Seto watches Kisara, as she is brought to another part of the palace. 
 Zorc Necrophades ' dragon-headed appendage is changed from pointing out between his legs to spiraling around his body.
