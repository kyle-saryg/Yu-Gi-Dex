 Burgerpalooza [1] , known as  Burger World  in the manga and Japanese version, is a fast food restaurant in  Domino City .
 
 Appearances 
       The restaurant as it appears in the manga.     
 Anzu Mazaki  got a job there, while still in school, in order to earn money to travel to America so she could become a professional dancer. But she tried to keep this job a secret, since after-school jobs are against school rules. Jonouchi and Yugi followed her there due to the former's suggestion that she was dating rich men for profit.  She was taken hostage by an  escaped convict  while working there.  Dark Yugi  rescued her. [2] 
 She was eventually fired after punching a customer, who touched her rump. [3] 
 In the first series anime, Anzu's friends, Hiroto Honda and  Miho Nosaka  also get jobs there. Miho (rather than Jonouchi) was the one who feared she was dating for pay, and followed Anzu there, resulting in Honda following Miho because he had the same concern about Miho; according to Miho, Honda started working there too, so he could buy lots of presents for Miho with his salary.
 In the second series anime, this scene happened a bit differently. Instead of Yugi sending a note about a dance studio, it was someone who took a picture of Téa working at Burger World and told her to come to the gym equipment room unless she wanted the photo sent to the school (as it is against the rules for students to work at Domino High School without a special condition). She arrives, expecting to find Joey and Yugi (the only two people from school who know her secret) but finds the  mugger  with a video camera. He tells her to do what he says if she doesn't want the picture to come out. The rest happens as it does in the manga.
