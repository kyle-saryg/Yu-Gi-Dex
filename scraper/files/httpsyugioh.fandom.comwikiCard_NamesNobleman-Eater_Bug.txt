 This card's approximated Arabic name (الحشرة آكلة النبلاء) translates to  Nobleman-Eater Insect . 
 In reality, the word "bug" does not exist in Arabic.  Arthropods  are referred to by their group ( insects ,  arachnids ,  crustaceans , etc.) or, more commonly, by their specific species. Although, "insect" is sometimes used as a collective term due to the fact that most arthropods are insects.
