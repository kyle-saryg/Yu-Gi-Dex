 Rare  (Japanese: レア  Rea ) cards are identified by usually having a silver card name and the image being not holofoil. The chances of getting one in a  Booster Pack  in the  TCG  is 1:1.
 In sets  Flaming Eternity  and later, Rare cards and cards of higher rarities can be found as  Ultimate Rares .
 As of  Duelist Revolution , Rares are now printed with a bronze-like card name instead of the previous silver, along with the universal change that the name plate is closer to the top part of the card, and the overall card does not contain the minute blots from the card printing press.
 There are also Colored Rares that are given away as  Duelist League participation cards . Starting with  DL09 , the colors were Blue, Bronze, Light Green and Light Blue versions of the 20 cards in the set, while  DL11 ,  DL12  and  DL13  have Green, Red, Blue, and Purple versions. The colors Black and White are also available in the  TCG  set,  Battle Pack: Epic Dawn  and  Battle Pack 2: War of the Giants . The color Gold is introduced in  Maximum Gold .
 As of  Eternity Code , Rares are no longer printed in core sets.
