 Summary 
 Dark Yugi  and  Haga  have 750 and 450  Life Points  respectively. Haga has managed to destroy " Cocoon of Evolution " before it achieved its  ultimate form . However it still hatched as " Great Moth " and he wonders how he can defeat it. Dark Yugi's friends comment that the "Great Moth" looks tough and  Mai  thinks that Haga has turned the tables. Haga asks who's laughing now and if the fear has shrivelled up Dark Yugi's tongue. Dark Yugi confidently replies that he was picturing in his head how the squash the "big mosquito". Haga is unconvinced and says that he would like to see Dark Yugi try.
 Haga gets his "Great Moth" to take flight, making it immune to any ground based attacks. He notes that none of Dark Yugi's monsters can fly, with the exception of " Curse of Dragon ", whose  ATK  is lower than that of "Great Moth" anyway. Haga announces that he will take out " Gaia the Fierce Knight " and " Beaver Warrior " first. Dark Yugi worries about this as "Gaia" is his main offense right now. He draws a card, thinking everything rests in it. "Great Moth" uses its " Moth Hurricane " attack, which Haga says should blast any landbound monsters. Dark Yugi's Life Points drop to 600 and Haga laughs that "Gaia" has been destroyed. However Dark Yugi reveals that he played " Polymerization ", fusing "Gaia the Fierce Knight and "Curse of Dragon" into " Gaia the Dragon Champion ". "Gaia" can now fly and has 2600 ATK, matching that of "Great Moth".
 Haga laughs that the ATK of "Gaia" didn't actually go up and explains that in the last attack, "Great Moth" scattered poison pollen, which has infected Dark Yugi's monsters and dropped the ATK of "Gaia the Dragon Champion" to 2100. Dark Yugi activates " Magic Mist ", surrounding the monsters in water vapour, washing away the pollen and preventing "Gaia" from losing any more ATK. Haga attacks "Gaia the Dragon Champion" with "Great Moth", using its "Moth Burning Death Tornado" attack. This destroys "Gaia" and drops Dark Yugi's Life Points to 100.
 Haga laughs, celebrating that he is going to win. However Dark Yugi laughs too and says that Haga has fallen into his trap. He explains that "Gaia the Dragon Champion" was just a decoy and then Summons " Summoned Skull ". Haga sighs in relief, thinking he had been worried for a moment, but "Great Moth" has more ATK than "Summoned Skull" and if they battle Dark Yugi's Life Points will go to 0. However Dark Yugi asks if Haga has realized why he played "Magic Mist" yet. The "Great Moth" is now wet and therefore more conductive to electricity. This raises the ATK of "Summoned Skull", who uses a lightning based attack to 3100. "Summoned Skull" attacks and destroys "Great Moth" with "Demon Lightning", dropping Haga's Life Points to 0.
 Dark Yugi's friends celebrate and Mai is impressed. Dark Yugi takes Haga's two  Star Chips  per their wager, eliminating Haga from the tournament 20 minutes after it began. He laughs at how the first person to lose all their Star Chips is the champion of Japan. He calls Haga an insect and tells him to get off the island or he'll pull of his legs, one by one. With three Star Chip, Dark Yugi thinks he needs seven more to get to  Pegasus Castle .

 Anime adaption 
 The end of the fifth episode of the  Yu-Gi-Oh!  anime  is based on this chapter. There are a number of differences including:
 
 Bakura  was not watching the Duel. 
 An explanation of how  fusion  works is added. However it is cut in the English version. 
 As the poison pollen effect is explained,  Yami Yugi  (Dark Yugi) has a flashback of  Yugi  and his friends running through the bug-infested forest. This scene is cut from the English version. 
 Yami Yugi had 50  Life Points  left after " Great Moth ",  destroyed  " Gaia the Dragon Champion ", rather than 100. 
 After the "Gaia the Dragon Champion" was destroyed,  Mai  and Yami Yugi's friends debated a bit over whether Yami Yugi still had a chance. 
 The ATK of " Summoned Skull " rose to 3500, rather than 3100. 
 A scene showing  Joey  (Jonouchi) taking  Weevil 's (Haga's)  Dueling Gauntlet  is shown.
