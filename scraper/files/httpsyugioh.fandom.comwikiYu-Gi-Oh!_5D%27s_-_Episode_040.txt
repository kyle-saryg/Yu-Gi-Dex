 Summary 
 After the damage 
       The damage caused by the  Shadow Duels .     
 The day after the  Earthbound Immortals attack  has left the  Arcadia Movement  building damaged, but still standing in the epicenter of the earthquakes. The Hummingbird and Lizard  lines  are still visible as they've dug high troughs into the earth, when they were formed. Any civilization within the lines is completely obliterated.
 Angela  reports on the scene, while  Security Maintenance  excavate. Angela says that an unidentifiable fire had hit the area and Security Maintenance are investigating. Unconfirmed reports say approximately 120 people living in the vicinity went missing and  the girl , who was extracted from the building in the center and taken to the  Domino Hospital , has yet to regain consciousness.
 At the hospital, a car pulls up at the front door. The senator,  Hideo , and his wife  Setsuko , emerge and are flocked by the press, who ask if he's here to see the victimized girl, if the recent incident will be brought up in parliament, and if the victim was the infamous duelist, the Black Rose. The senator ignores them as he walks briskly past. Setsuko timidly follows suit with her eyes shut.
 
 In the hospital 
 Akiza  is attended to, as she lies on a hospital bed in the center of a very large room, that is otherwise empty. Outside the room,  Leo ,  Luna  and  Jack  watch the procedure through the glass walls. Leo finds it cool, that three  Signers  are gathered together.
 
       Akiza's parents hear that their daughter may stay unconscious.     
 Then Hideo and Setsuko rush in. Setsuko leans against the glass and cries out Akiza's name. The doctor and nurse exit the room. Hideo calls to them and introduces himself and his wife as Akiza's parents. Setsuko asks what her condition is like. The doctor says they've done all they could and invites the two in. They haven't had any feedback yet, but worry that she could stay unconscious, due to emotional trauma. Setsuko blames herself and Hideo, thinking they drove her to this point. She drops her arms and face unto Akiza's bed and begs Akiza to wake up and to forgive them.
 Outside Luna remarks that they're Signers, one and the same, but there's nothing they can do to save Akiza, nothing that will get the message to Akiza's heart. Jack on the other hand, tells her that all they have in common is the  birthmark . They know nothing of each other, nor are they eager to learn. Jack states they need someone who knows the real Akiza, but with  Sayer  gone, there aren't any options. "But if I know him right...", ("Unless he might be able to help her..." in the dub) he says as he enters the room, leaving the twins bewildered. Jack approaches the girl's parents and tells them that there is only one man who has been able to open Akiza's heart;  Yusei Fudo .
 
 Satellite 
       Hideo's helicopter arrives.     
 Outside  Martha's  refuge, Yusei works on his  Duel Runner , while  Blister  looks up information about the incident at the Arcadia Movement building on his computer. Blister approaches Yusei with results. He has evidence to support Yusei's hunch about the  Dark Signers  involvement; The  Dark Signers  came to New Domino and attacked the Arcadia Movement building and he's heard that Akiza was taken to a hospital afterwards. While Yusei is worried as a friend, he thinks he cannot help her in his current condition. A helicopter appears above them, with Hideo inside.
 
         Hideo asks Yusei for help.     
 Inside the refuge, Yusei sits to talk with Hideo. Blister stands nearby and Martha serves tea. Hideo introduces himself as a senator, rethinks and instead introduces himself as Akiza's father. Yusei asks what can he do for him. Hideo explains the situation and that requests Yusei's help. Hearing this, Yusei is certain that Akiza faced a Dark Signer. Hideo cries about how they're her parents and they can't do anything to save her. Martha hands him a cup of tea and comfortably advises him to calm down, before frowning and saying if he doesn't explain the situation rationally, they won't understand what's going on. Hideo blames himself for Akiza's state.
 
 
 Izinski family flashbacks 
 Hideo remembers back to when he was chauffeured to a meeting held by Security Maintenance. He checks with another man in the car, asking if it's mandatory for him to attend this meeting. The man replies that it is, even if he has later plans. Hideo's phone rings. As he answers it, a projection of a much younger Akiza appears. She tells him to hurry home for her birthday. He replies that he will, but afterwards anxiously touches his head off the phone.
 
         Akiza asleep waiting for her father.     
 Later that day, Hideo returns home. He and Setsuko enter a room, where Akiza has fallen asleep waiting in front of her cake, while waiting for her father to come home. Hideo carries to her bed, where he cries and asks to be forgiven. He leaves a wrapped present next to bed, before leaving.
 
         Akiza cries about her father breaking his promise.     
 The next day, Akiza excitedly rushes down the stairs, having opened her present,  Structure Deck: Lord of the Storm . She thanks her dad, saying it's the Deck she wanted and that she loves him. She is let down, after she asks if he'll duel her later, since Hideo has an important job to attend to and won't return for about a month. Akiza runs away crying that her dad has broken his promises and that she hates him (In the dub, she tells him to never come back again).
 Although his job as senator, restricted his time with Akiza, Hideo tells Yusei that he tried his hardest to spend time with Akiza.
 He then remembers when he managed to make time to Duel Akiza. Hideo has " Samsara Lotus " on his side of the  field , while Akiza has 1  face-down  card in her  Spell & Trap Card Zone . Akiza flips " Rose Flame ". As she is about to  activate  its effect, Hideo receives a phone call. He apologizes to Akiza, as he must head out. Akiza gets upset and activates "Rose Flame's" effect. A whirlwind of fire and petals erupts from the card, flinging Hideo against a wall. Hideo falls from the wall and Setsuko rushes to him. They look back at Akiza, whose arm is now glowing, as a  Mark of the Dragon  forms. She cries as she says she's scared and approaches her parents. Hideo tells her to stay back and asks what that power is; it's almost as if she's some monster. Akiza is deeply stung by these words and starts bawling. Hideo tries to apologize, but Akiza continues to cry.
 Hideo tells Yusei that that was the one word he'd regret ever saying.
 
         Akiza distanced from her peers.     
         Akiza attacking other children with her powers.     
 Since Akiza had those terrifying powers, he had no idea how to deal with her. He weeps as he remembers Akiza scaring away a group of kids by Summoning a " Gigaplant ". He later slapped Akiza on the cheek. He and Setsuko are both shocked. Akiza cries and asks if he did it because she's not a normal kid, because she's is a monster (In the dub, the slapping didn't happen).
 Rather than have her stay with parents who couldn't understand her, Hideo sent her to  The New Domino City Duel Academy . Akiza entered Duel Academy as a teenager. Here she was still isolated due to her powers.
 
         Akiza runs away.     
 While lying unconscious in the hospital, Akiza remembers running home from Duel Academy, one day. Looking through a window she sees her parents celebrating and laughing. She thought that they were happy because she wasn't around anymore. Furiously she places a card into her  Duel Disk , causing all the glass on the building to shatter. Akiza runs off, initially crying, but seeing as her father was laughing, she decides to laugh and set her powers free.
 Akiza remembers meeting  Sayer  as the Black Rose. She duels Sayer, attacking him with " Violet Witch " to demonstrate her powers. Sayer remarks that to her parents, who don't have powers, Akiza may be a monster, but to those at the  Arcadia Movement , she is just another fragile human being. Still being blasted by "Violet Witch", Sayer strains and makes his way towards Akiza. He tells her that she can stay here, the way she is and not have to think about tough times. Sayer hugs her and says he'll think for her. To Akiza, as long as Sayer showed her the way, everything was fine. Akiza remembers dueling Yusei, during the  Fortune Cup . Yusei told her not to leave her thinking to others and that she should love herself. She initially refuses, but asks him to help her after the Duel.
 
 Agreement 
 Back in the present, Hideo pleas with Yusei; his daughter's heart has been closed so tight his voice can't reach it. Although Yusei feels he can't help her in his current condition, Hideo grabs his hand and begs. Jack Atlas told him Yusei tried to rescue her during the Fortune Cup and he thinks Yusei can rescue her now. Although Yusei doesn't think there is much he can do.
 Martha points out that the nice adult is pleading with him and commands Yusei to help him. She accuses him of being afraid of facing his former friend,  Kalin Kessler  and asks what's the point of having friends, if you can't even face them. Yusei replies that holding a grudge against Kiryu won't get him anywhere, but Martha grabs his ear and asks if he can't take a hint. She believes the door to Yusei's heart is also closed and the only ones who may open it are his friends. Yusei takes to Martha's words and agrees to help. Martha begins to tease Yusei about him having a crush on Akiza. Yusei tries to deny it, but Martha tells him not to be shy and go nab his future wife. Yusei, both shocked and embarrassed, tries to tell Martha off, but is interrupted by Martha and Blister laughing, Blister joking that he already had a girlfriend in his Duel Runner.
 
 Akiza wakes up 
 Yusei and Hideo arrive at the hospital, where he is greeted by the twins, still waiting outside Akiza's room with Jack. Yusei walks past them, as Hideo guides the four into the room.
 
         Akiza wakes up.     
 Yusei stands next to Akiza's bed. He reaches for her face to wipe away a tear, causing their  birthmarks  to react. Akiza wakes up and spots Yusei. She gets up and asks if he came to rescue her, but she then spots her parents. This intimidates her and she tries telling them she no longer needs them, but then remembers  what happened to   Sayer .
 With the one man, who could offer her what her father couldn't, now gone, she thinks they have came to mock her about that. She shoves Yusei away from her and readies her  Duel Disk . Yusei tries calming her down, but she sees him as an enemy. Akiza places a card into her Duel Disk, causing a gust to blow away the medical equipment and blow back the spectators. From Yusei's perspective, it would seem the only way to reach to her heart is by dueling. He readies his Duel Disk and prepares to fight back. This physical motive matches Akiza's as she agrees they should fight, but to her this is because they are not friends. Yusei disagrees and says that this Duel is to prove they are friends.
 
 The Duel 
 Akiza  Summons  " Evil Thorn " and activates its effect. The grenade on the plant explodes, inflicting 300  damage  to Yusei, dropping his  Life Points  to 3700. The plant shrivels up and 2 more are Summoned in its place. Next she plays " Closed Plant Gate ", surrounding her monsters with vines and preventing Yusei from  attacking  during his next turn. She ends her turn.
 Yusei Summons " Shield Warrior " in  Defense Position . He  Sets  2 cards in his  Spell & Trap Card Zone  and ends his turn.
 Akiza begins her turn and the vines surrounding her monsters disappears. She Summons " Twilight Rose Knight " and uses its effect to  Special Summon  " Dark Verger ". She declares that she is about to  tune  her 4 monsters. Leo tries adding up their  Levels  and  Luna  tells him its 7. Jack rightly predicts " Black Rose Dragon ". Akiza begins chanting and the dragon appears, kicking up gusts. Jack remarks that Akiza is coming at Yusei full force, Summoning that card, this early. Akiza  equips  it with " Thorn of Malice ", raising its  ATK  to 3000. She looks at her father's eyes, observing that they are the same as back when he called her a monster. She vows to make Yusei suffer the same fate. With the place Sayer gave her gone, she plans to remove every place off the face of this world.
