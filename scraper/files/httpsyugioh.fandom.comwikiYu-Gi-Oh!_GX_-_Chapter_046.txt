 Birth of the Ultimate Tag!! 
 
 "Tag Duel!!"  is the forty-sixth chapter of the  Yu-Gi-Oh! GX  manga . It was first printed in Japanese in the  V Jump  magazine and in English in the  Shonen Jump  magazine. Both of which were printed in  volume 7  of the  Yu-Gi-Oh! GX  graphic novels afterwards.
 An inter-school  Tag-Team Duel  is about to begin.  Bastion Misawa  and  Alexis Rhodes  will face  Adrian Gecko  and  Jesse Anderson .  Principal MacKenzie  has promised Adrian that he'll be able to advance to the  Pro League  should his team be victorious.
 
 Summary 
 The American Duelists are the topic of conversation all around  Duel Academy .  Chazz  and  Jaden  meet in private to discuss the situation. They are both worried the American students may have powers similar to those of  David  and agree to be on their guard for more  Shadow Duels . Jaden vows to find and defeat the person who put  Koyo  in a coma.  Principal MacKenzie  had met with his students earlier, and promised to advance those that successfully defeat the Japanese students to the  Pro League .  Adrian  is very excited about that prospect.
 Jaden and  Syrus  are in  the forest , where they meet  Jesse . He asks if they've saw a butterfly pass by a moment ago, but does so in English. Jaden and Syrus do not understand him. Jesse runs off to chase after it, but returns a moment later, addressing Jaden and Syrus in Japanese by name and by Deck type. He remarks that it would be a lot of fun to Duel them, and Syrus reflects that Jesse is similar to Jaden in that regard Syrus asks what type of Deck Jesse plays, but Jesse tells them to wait until the next day and rushes off after seeing a Japanese rhinoceros beetle. Syrus thinks he already has a good idea what Deck it is.  Axel  sits in his room, where he watches footage of Chazz's Duel with David.
 The tournament begins later that day.  Dr. Crowler  announces that they will start it with  Tag-Team Duels  and that the teams for each school will be chosen at random. A lottery application on his  PDA  matches Jesse and Adrian against  Alexis  and  Bastion , much to Bastion's delight and Adrain's dread. The Duel begins, with Alexis countering Adrain's " Forbidden Beast 's" handily, but Bastion flubs his first turn, falling into Adrian's " Mantra of Agony "  Trap Card  which allows Adrain to add his " Forbidden Mantra " Spell to his hand. Bastion hopes to make up for his mistake next turn and apologizes. Jesse's Summoning of the weak " White Papillon " causes Adrian to decide he won't be able to rely on Jesse. Jaden and Syrus however, are quite pleased that their guess that Jesse used an  Insect  Deck was correct. Alexis draws her " Blizzard Princess ," pleased that she's drawn it and she thinks that she'll be ready to Summon her soon. Bastion, however, thinks that he can't let Alexis see him Duel so badly and that he'll make up for it on the next turn.
