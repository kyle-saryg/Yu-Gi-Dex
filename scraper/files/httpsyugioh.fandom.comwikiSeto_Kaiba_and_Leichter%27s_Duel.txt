 Turn 1: Leichter 
 Leichter  draws a  monster  and subsequently sets it. He then Sets two cards (one of which is " Imperial Order ").
 Turn 2: Kaiba 
 Kaiba  draws. He then  Normal Summons  " Spear Dragon " (1900/0) in  Attack Position . "Spear Dragon"  attacks  and  destroys  Leichter's  face-down  monster. It's revealed to be " Hiro's Shadow Scout " (650/500). "Spear Dragon" then inflicts piercing damage to Leichter (Leichter 4000 → 2600). Since "Hiro's Shadow Scout" was  flipped , its  Flip Effect  activates, forcing Kaiba to  draw  three cards and reveal them and if Kaiba draws any Magic Cards through this effect, they will be discarded. The revealed cards are " Cave Dragon ", " Double Snare " and " Magic Reflector ", and the latter two cards are discarded. "Spear Dragon" switches itself to Defense Position at the end of the Damage Step due to its second effect. Kaiba Sets a card (" Crush Card "). On Kaiba's End Phase, Leichter  activates  his face-down " Solemn Wishes ". Now each time Leichter draws a card, he will gain 500 Life Points.
 Turn 3: Leichter 
Leichter draws (Leichter 2600 → 3100). Leichter then Sets a monster and Sets a card.
 Turn 4: Kaiba 
Kaiba draws. He then Normal Summons " Giant Germ " (1000/0) in Attack Position (1000/100). He then switches "Spear Dragon" to Attack Position. "Spear Dragon" attacks Leichter's face-down monster, but Leichter activates his face-down " Mask of Perplexity " to redirect the attack to "Giant Germ", destroying it (Kaiba 4000 → 3100). Kaiba attempts to activate his face-down "Crush Card" which will destroy every monster in Leichter's hand, field, and Deck with at least 1500 ATK, but Leichter activates the  Deck Master ability  of his Deck Master: by firing a beam from his eyes that  negates  all of Kaiba's  Trap Cards . Kaiba then figures out what Monster Leichter has chosen for his Deck Master. Leichter removes his clothing and reveals he is " Jinzo ".
 Leichter takes a break from the duel to remind Kaiba of one of his past birthdays. In it Gozaboro offers Kaiba 10 million dollars as a test of his business skills. The task: He is to make ten times the amount he was given within a years time, and Gozaboro offers the assistance of Leichter as the only help he will get.
 Kaiba manages to come up with a plan: In order to control a company he needs a large amount of stock to buy it out. The number is 51. If Kaiba can control 51% of a company, he can control it all. he instructs Leichter to invest 51% of his given money, $5,100,000, into any company, on the condition the company in question values it's workers. Leichter manages to find a company that treats its employees like family, but might not make enough, unless Kaiba runs the company his way. He strongarms the owner and buys his company, and at the end of the year, Kaiba did make the amount Gozaboro set up for him.
 Kaiba commences the duel.

Since "Cyber Jar" was flipped, its Flip Effect destroys every monster on the  field  and allows both players to  Pick up  5 cards from their Deck as well as allow both players to Special Summon any Level 4 or below monsters that they pick up while the other picked-up cards are added to the players' hands. Kaiba Special Summons " Vorse Raider " (1900/1200) in Attack Position and " Twin-Headed Behemoth " (1500/1200) in Defense Position while Leichter Special Summons " Injection Fairy Lily " (400/1500) in Attack Position.

It's revealed to be " The Wicked Worm Beast " (1400/700). After damage calculation, the ATK of "Satellite Cannon" is decreased to 0 ("Satellite Cannon": 1000 → 0/0) due to its fourth effect. On Leichter's End Phase, the third effect of "Satellite Cannon" activates ("Satellite Cannon": 0 → 1000/0).
 At this point, Leichter continues his story: After making the $100,000,000, it wasn't enough for Seto so he made a deal with the Big 5 to buy out KaibaCorp right from under Gozaboro's nose. Everyone involved with Kaiba's plan slowly bought out stocks from the company, but someone had been leaking out info of this plan to Gozaboro and that someone was Mokuba. Seto confronted and berated Mokuba about this. After being treated harshly, Mokuba went to Gozaboro for comfort but Gozaboro only wished to do so because both he and Seto at that point had bought out 49% of KaibaCorp and Mokuba's 2% in stocks would tip the scales in the power struggle. Gozaboro confronted Seto and, confident, told him to go back to the orphanage but Mokuba gives the 2% to his brother Seto, making him the new president of KaibaCorp. Because of this, Gozaboro ran away and was never seen since. But Leichter knew the truth: It was Seto who snitched to Gozaboro to make the latter think he was winning. He criticized Kaiba for taking everything from The Big Five. Kaiba told him that life is a game and if he can't win he shouldn't bother playing.
 Turn 12: Kaiba 
Seto draws "Spirit Ryu". He then switches "Twin-Headed Behemoth" to  Attack Position . Next he  Normal Summons  " Spirit Ryu " (1000/1000) in Attack Position. "Spirit Ryu" then attacks "Injection Fairy Lily", but Leichter activates "Injection Fairy Lily's" effect to pay 2000 Life Points (Leichter 3400 → 1400) and increase his "Injection Fairy Lily's" ATK by 3000 ("Injection Fairy Lily": 400 → 3400/1500) during damage calculation only. 
 Kaiba activates "Spirit Ryu's" effect,  discarding  two  Dragons  (" Hyozanryu " and " Cave Dragon ") from his  hand  in order to increase "Spirit Ryu's" ATK by 1000 for each Dragon discarded ("Spirit Ryu": 1000 → 3000/1000). "Injection Fairy Lily" destroys "Spirit Ryu" (Kaiba 1200 → 800). After damage calculation, the effect of "Injection Fairy Lily" expires ("Injection Fairy Lily 3400 → 400/1500). "Twin-Headed Behemoth" attacks and destroys "Injection Fairy Lily" (Leichter 1400 → 800).
 Turn 13: Leichter 
Leichter draws (Leichter 800 → 1300). On Leichter's Standby Phase, the effect of "Life Absorbing Machine" activates (Leichter 1300 → 1650). Leichter chooses not to pay the  cost  of "Imperial Order", so it's destroyed. He then Sets a monster. "Satellite Cannon" attacks "Twin-Headed Behemoth". Since "Satellite Cannon" can't be destroyed in battle by monsters who are Level 7 or below, only "Twin-Headed Behemoth" is destroyed. After damage calculation, the ATK of "Satellite Cannon" is decreased to 0 ("Satellite Cannon": 1000 → 0/0) due to its fourth effect. On Leichter's End Phase, the third effect of "Satellite Cannon" activates ("Satellite Cannon": 0 → 1000/0).

"Possessed Dark Soul" attacks Leichter's face-down monster. Leichter reveals his face-down monster to be " Dreamsprite " (300/200), whose effect allows Leichter to redirect the attack to "Satellite Cannon". As "Possessed Dark Soul" is not a Level 8 or above monster, "Satellite Cannon" is not destroyed and Leichter takes no Battle Damage.
 Turn 15: Leichter 
Leichter draws (Leichter 1650 → 2150). On Leichter's End Phase, the third effect of "Satellite Cannon" activates ("Satellite Cannon": 1000 → 2000/0).
 Turn 16: Kaiba 
Kaiba draws "Blue-Eyes White Dragon". He then Sets a monster. Next Kaiba activates his  Deck Master's ability  to pay 500 Life Points (Seto 800 → 300) and allow himself to Normal Summon another monster this  turn . Kaiba then  Tributes  both of his monsters in order to  Tribute Summon  " Blue-Eyes White Dragon " (3000/2500) in Attack Position. "Blue-Eyes White Dragon" attacks and destroys "Satellite Cannon", whose ATK is treated as 0 during the opponent's turn (Leichter 2150 → 0).
