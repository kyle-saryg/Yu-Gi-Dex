 Featured Duel: Yugo vs. Ren 
 This Duel is conducted as an  Action Duel . Both players can obtain and use  Action Cards .
 Turn 1: Yugo 
 Yugo  obtains an Action Card. Since neither player  controls  a  monster , he  Normal Summons  " Speedroid Passing Rider " (2200/2000) without  Tributing . Yugo  Sets  1 card.
 Turn 2: Ren 
Yugo obtains another Action Card.  Ren  Normal Summons " White Moray " (600/200). Ren  activates  " White Circle Reef ",  destroying  "Moray" and  adding  a second copy of it from his  Deck  to his  hand . He then activates " White Mirror ", allowing him to  Special Summon  "Moray" back from the  Graveyard  and add a third copy from his Deck to his hand. Next, he activates " White Prosperity ", Special Summoning the two other copies of "Moray" from his hand. The  effect  of the "Moray" who was Special Summoned from the Graveyard allows Ren to use it as a  Tuner monster . Ren tunes two of his "Morays" with the third "Moray", treated as a Tuner monster - all  Level  2 - to  Synchro Summon  " White Aura Dolphin " (2400/1000). He activates the effect of "Dolphin", halving the ATK of Yugo's "Passing Rider" ("Passing Rider": 2200 → 1100 ATK). Ren  attacks  "Passing Rider" with "Dolphin", but Yugo activates his  face-down  " Barrier Gum ", preventing the destruction of "Passing Rider"  in battle  (Yugo: 4000 → 2700 LP). Ren Sets 1 card.
 Turn 3: Yugo

He tunes the Level 5 "Passing Rider" with the Level 2 "Domino Butterfly" to Synchro Summon " Clearwing Fast Dragon " (2500/2000). He proceeds to activate its effect,  negating  the effects of Ren's "Dolphin" and reducing its ATK to zero ("Dolphin": 2400 → 0 ATK). Ren activates the Action Card " Against the Wind ", switching "Clearwing" to  Defense Position  and reducing its  DEF  by 1000 ("Clearwing": 2000 → 1000 DEF), but Yugo activates the Action Card " Follow Wing ", switching "Clearwing" back to  Attack Position  and increasing its ATK by 500 ("Clearwing": 2500 → 3000 ATK).
