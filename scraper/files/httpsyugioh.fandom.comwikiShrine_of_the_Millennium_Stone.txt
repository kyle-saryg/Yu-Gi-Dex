      Millennium Stone     
 The  Shrine of the Millennium Stone , known by the names  Mortuary Temple  and  Shrine of the Underworld  in the manga and Japanese version, is the location of the  Millennium Stone , where the  Millennium Items  originated. If all seven Millennium Items are placed into the stone, a door to the afterlife is opened.  Thief King Bakura  used the stone in his  Shadow Game  with  Pharaoh Atem  to summon  Zorc Necrophades . In the present day, Yugi had placed the items in the stone before his final Duel with Atem so that the  Eye of Wdjat  could separate their spirits into two physical bodies so that the Ceremonial Battle could begin. In the manga, it was Atem who placed the items into the stone. 
 In  The Dark Side of Dimensions  movie (taking place six months later), archaeologists excavated the ruins under the orders of  Seto Kaiba , where pieces of the  Millennium Puzzle  were recovered. After the excavation,  Mani  found and recovered the  Millennium Ring .
