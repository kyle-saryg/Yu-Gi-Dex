 Summary 
 Joey  is randomly selected to duel against  Odion  (whom everybody still believes is  Marik ) in the Battle City finals. Joey is extremely determined and eager to win the duel to get back at Marik for recently brainwashing him with his  Millennium Rod  and turning him against his best friend,  Yugi , and to fulfil his promise he made to Yugi when he gave him his  Red Eyes Black Dragon ; that he would help him defeat Marik. Before the duel, Odion shows off his fake Millennium Rod in order to keep up his disguise so that everyone is still convinced that he is Marik. Joey realizes that the item in Odion's hand must be what Marik used to brainwash him.  Serenity  is worried about her brother, but at the same time very excited to see him duel for the very first time in person.  Duke  too is worried about Joey and questions Yugi if Joey took back his Red Eyes Black Dragon for the duel. Yugi shakes his head. However, while Joey does not have his Red Eyes in his deck, he does have other rare powerful cards to use against Odion such as  Jinzo ,  Insect Queen  and  The Legendary Fisherman  all of which he won from his Battle City opponents;  Espa Roba ,  Weevil Underwood  and  Mako Tsunami .
 Like everyone else,  Kaiba  is convinced that Odion is Marik, and is determined to see Odion play  The Winged Dragon Of Ra  against Joey, in order for him to identify it's strengths and weaknesses to work out a strategy to defeat it so he can add it to his deck. 
 
 Featured Duel: Joey Wheeler vs. Odion, Part 1 
 Turn 1: Joey 
 Joey   draws . He then  Normal Summons  " Gearfried the Iron Knight " (1800/1600) in  Attack Position .
 Turn 2: Odion 
 Odion  draws. He then  activates  " Temple of the Kings ". Now Odion can activate Trap Cards the same turn they are set and Joey will only be allowed to activate two Magic/Trap Cards per turn. Odion then  Sets  two cards.
 Turn 3: Joey 
Joey's hand contains " Giant Trunade ", " Swordsman of Landstar ", " Scapegoat ", " Graverobber ", and "Hayabusa Knight". Joey draws " Tiny Guardian " and subsequently Normal Summons it (1400/1800) in Attack Position.
 Turn 4: Odion 
Odion draws. He then Sets two cards.
 Turn 5: Joey 
Joey draws. He then Normal Summons " Hayabusa Knight " (1000/700) in Attack Position. Joey then activates "Giant Trunade" to return all Magic/Trap Cards on the field to their owners' hands, but Odion activates his face-down " Judgment of Anubis " to  negate  the effect of "Giant Trunade" and  destroy  it. After that happens, the second effect of "Judgment of Anubis" activates, destroying every  monster  Joey  controls  and inflicting  damage  to Joey equal to half the total ATK of his destroyed monsters (Joey 4000 → 1900).
 Turn 6: Odion 
Odion draws. He then Sets two cards.
 Turn 7: Joey 
Joey draws " Alligator's Sword " and subsequently Normal Summons it (1500/1200) in Attack Position. Joey then  Sets  a card.

Odion passes.
 Turn 9: Joey 
Joey draws. He then passes.
 Turn 10: Odion 
Odion draws. He then passes.
 Turn 11: Joey 
Joey draws " Rocket Warrior " and subsequently Normal Summons it (1500/1300) in  Attack Position . "Rocket Warrior"  attacks  directly, but Odion activates his face-down " Eye of Ujat " to redirect the attack to "Alligator's Sword". However Joey activates " Fairy Box " which hides "Alligator's Sword" within a whack-a-mole box before the attack strikes. The attack made by "Rocket Warrior" strikes, but it misses. Odion then activates his three face-down " Embodiments of Apophis " to  Special Summon  the three Trap Cards as monsters (1600/1800 for each) in Attack Position. 
 Duel continues next episode. 
 
 Changes to the English version 
 In the US version, " Giant Trunade " is shown traveling across the screen in front of  Odion 's face as he explains what happened. 
 Right after  Mai 's close-up, a shot of Odion looking fierce in the US version replaces a shot of  Yugi , Mai and  Tea 's backs. Note that the shot of Odion is reversed—his tattoo's on the wrong side of his face. 
 A shot of  Joey  getting all wound up is cut from the US version. 
 A shot of the gang reacting to Joey's boasts is cut from the US version. 
 Errors 
 After  " Judgment of Anubis " is played when the camera zooms out, Yugi's head looks smaller. 
 After "Judgment of Anubis" destroys Joey's monsters, when the camera cuts back to Odion, his tattoo is on the opposite side of his face.
