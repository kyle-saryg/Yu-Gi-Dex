 Design 
 Appearance 
 His appearance mimics  Atem  - he has similar, but smaller bangs that fall over his face, his jacket flares out from the waist just like Yugi's did and the patch on his shirt bears the shape of the  Millennium Puzzle . When impersonating  Jaden , he uses Jaden's  Slifer Red  wardrobe and even styles his hair in a similar albeit messier fashion. [1] 
 
 Personality 
 His personality changes depending on who he is impersonating. Dimitri could be a jab to the phenomenon of  netdecking  and  Cookie Cutter  Decks, as he attempts to win Duels by copying the strategies and mannerisms of known professional Duelists is very similar.
 In the dub, Dimitri mimics  Yugi's  voice when he uses Yugi's Deck. He also refers to his  Spell Cards  as "Magic Cards", as this was the term used in the  original  Yu-Gi-Oh!  series  before the revised printing format of the  TCG  took effect. Also during his  turns , the Duel score from the original series is played as opposed to the  GX  score.
 
 Biography 
 Dimitri is first seen trying to get a ticket to see  Yugi Muto 's Deck on display by Dueling  Syrus Truesdale  for the last one with Syrus trying to get it for  Jaden Yuki  as he already had one. After losing a Duel against Syrus with a copy of  Dr. Crowler 's Deck, he got desperate because he had researched the strategies of many strong Duelist such as  Yugi Muto ,  Seto Kaiba ,  Zane Truesdale  and Dr. Crowler while still unable to win Duels, so he decided to steal Yugi's Deck from its display case during the exhibition. [2] 
 He successfully does so late at night and believes that he will become all-powerful with this Deck. When Syrus caught him with the Deck outside on the rocky harbor area, Dimitri duels him to test out the power of Yugi's Deck. Dimitri defeats Syrus in a rematch and Jaden then challenges Dimitri to get the stolen Deck back. [2]  During the Duel he actually manages to convince himself that he  is  Yugi. In the Japanese version this happened towards the end of his Duel with Jaden, while in the English dub it happened beforehand. Despite having the Deck in his possession, Dimitri is defeated by Jaden with the explanation to him being that he lacked the same heart that Yugi put into creating his Deck. Apparently, the message doesn't get through, as he then goes on to impersonate Jaden. In both the English and Japanese versions, he proceeds to mess up Jaden's signature pose and catchphrases, though said phrases differ between the two. [1] 
 He made a cameo in  episode 179  watching Jaden's Graduation ceremony in his original clothing after  Nightshroud 's defeat. [3] 
 
 Deck 
 Anime 
 Cookie Cutter 
 Dimitri lacks an original Deck of his own and is seen playing Crowler's " Ancient Gear " Deck and Yugi Muto's stolen Deck. However in both versions, he makes a quick reference to having used  Seto Kaiba 's (likely excluding any Blue Eyes monsters, as in the continuity, only Kaiba possesses Blue Eyes White Dragon) and  Zane Truesdale 's Decks. After his final loss, he made a Deck resembling Jaden's.

 When first faced in his event, Dimitri uses  Immortal Magicians , which utilizes a lot of Yugi's cards from the anime. After said event, he resolves to be more original with his Decks, and rotates periodically between an Ancient Gear Deck, an improved Spellcaster Deck, and an Exodia Deck (after you complete the game, he does not use the Ancient Gear Deck anymore).
