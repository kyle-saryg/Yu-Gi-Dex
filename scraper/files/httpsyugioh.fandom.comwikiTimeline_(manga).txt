 Official sources on the timeline seem to be self-contradictory.  Mokuba Kaiba 's recollection of  Seto Kaiba 's past means Seto would be 16 at the time of  Death-T . However Seto's age at the time of graduation, birthday and the timing of Death-T indicate he should be 15. If you have any insights, please discuss on  the talk page .     
 This is an in-universe  timeline  of events from the manga series,  Yu-Gi-Oh! ,  Yu-Gi-Oh! R  and  Yu-Gi-Oh! GX , and the film  Yu-Gi-Oh! The Dark Side of Dimensions .
 Events from the  Yu-Gi-Oh!  manga are considered to have taken place in the timelines for  R ,  GX  and  The Dark Side of Dimensions . However events from  R ,  GX  and  The Dark Side of Dimensions  do not necessarily take place within each others' timelines.

 Notes 
 
 ↑   Atem was from the  Eighteenth Dynasty of Egypt , which lasted from 1549/1550 B.C. to 1292 B.C. 
 
 ↑   "1960" is mentioned at the beginning of the chapter. Sugoroku is 43 at the time and is 72 sometime between April 1996 and September 1997, suggesting 1960 is the decade rather than the year. 
 
 ↑   Keith was 26, during Duelist Kingdom, which seems to have taken place in 1997, before his birthday 
 
 ↑   Rishid is 25, during Battle City, which seems to take place in 1997, before his birthday. He also mentions being born about 5 years before Ishizu and 9 years before Marik. 
 
 ↑   Pegasus is 24 during Duelist Kingdom, which seems to take place in spring 1997, placing 1972 as his birth year. 
 
 ↑   Mai and Pegasus were 24 at the same time when they appeared. Neither of their birthdays had passed the year when they both appeared, suggesting they were born the same year. 
 
 ↑   Ishizu was 20 during Battle City, which seems to take place sometime between mid-April and September, suggesting 1977 is her birth year. 
 
 ↑   Jonouchi was born January 25 and was 16 in summer 1996, meaning he was born in 1980. Although, this would mean he started high school at 16, rather than the usual 15. 
 
 ↑   Esper was 17 during Battle City, which took place in 1997, after his birthday. 
 
 ↑   Yugi was born June 4 and was 18 in March 1999, implying 1980 is his birth year. 
 
 ↑   Kaiba was born October 25 and was 18 in March 1999, implying 1980 is his birth year. 
 
 ↑   Marik is 16 during Battle City, which seems to takes place between April and September 1997, suggesting 1980 is his birth year. Rishid said Marik was born 4 years after Ishizu. This may have been a rounding up from 3 years and 8 months. 
 
 ↑   Marik's mother died giving birth to Marik. 
 
 ↑   Ryuji is sixteen when he faces Yugi in  Dungeon Dice Monsters , which seems to take place in April 1997 
 
 ↑   Ghost Kozkua is 15 during Duelist Kingdom, which seems to take place in 1997, before his birthday 
 
 ↑   Ryuzaki is 15, during the national championship, which seems to take place in spring 1997. This is before his birthday, suggesting he was born in 1981. 
 
 ↑   Haga is 14, during the national championship, which seems to take place in spring 1997. This is before his birthday, suggesting he was born in 1982. 
 
 ↑   Yugi acquired the Millennium Puzzle about eight years before he managed to solve it. 
 
 ↑   Cyndia died shortly after Pegasus' 17th birthday 
 
 ↑   Pegasus traveled to Egypt a few months after Cyndia's death. Cyndia died shortly after October 8, 1989, suggesting these events took place in 1990. 
 
 ↑   This took place after Marik's tenth birthday. 
 
 ↑   This event took place while Seto was ten years old. Given he was born October 25, 1980, the event took place between October 25, 1990 and October 24, 1991 
 
 ↑   Seto and Mokuba were put in an orphanage shortly after their father's death. 
 
 ↑   Seto and Mokuba were adopted not long after being put in the orphanage and six years before Gozaburo's death. 
 
 ↑   Duelist Kingdom seems to have taken place in spring 1997. Jonouchi said that his parents separated six years earlier. Given he may have rounded a few months, the separation seems to have occurred in late 1990 or 1991. 
 
 ↑   This took place one year after Marik's Rite of the Tomb Guardians and five years before Battle City. 
 
 ↑   Death-T  occurred sometime between April and summer 1997. Gozaburo died six months earlier, meaning he died in 1996 or 1997. 
 
 ↑   Yugi is his first year of high school and is still in first year next summer, so this event takes place between the start of the Japanese school year, April, and summer. 
 
 ↑   Two months before  Egypt Unearthed , a newspaper gave 1996 as the year. If this event takes place between April and summer, it would have been the same year as it was two months previously. 
 
 ↑   The  Domino High school festival  is mentioned as being  bunkasai , the  Japanese cultural festival . This event usually takes place in autumn. However individual schools may host it at any time. If the Domino High festival had taken place in autumn, it would result in contradictory information about the characters' school grades 
 
 ↑  31.0   31.1   Yugi's class is mention as being 1-B, implying he is in first year of high school. 
 
 ↑   In a flashback from two months earlier, the  Japan Daily News  mentions 1996 as the year. 
 
 ↑   Pegasus and Keith's Duel took place after Dark Yugi and Kaiba's Duel, but before Death-T, evidenced by Kaiba beginning to develop  Solid Vision . When it occurred in relation to other events between those two dates is uncertain. 
 
 ↑   Starting this chapter, characters wear the summer variation of their school uniforms. 
 
 ↑   Anzu mentions being on summer vacation. 
 
 ↑   Jonouchi mentions it being summer. 
 
 ↑   The  Yovega Fireboy  had the year 1997 printed on it, suggesting this chapter takes place in 1997 or late 1996. 
 
 ↑   Characters stop wearing the summer variation of their school uniform in this chapter. 
 
 ↑   The bare trees outside Bakura's apartment suggest autumn has begun. 
 
 ↑   This event takes place shortly before a week before the Duelist Kingdom tournament. 
 
 ↑   The grown leaves suggest spring has begun. 
 
 ↑   A new Japanese school year begins. Japanese school years begin in April. 
 
 ↑   A newspaper mentions an upcoming event occurring on August 23 and 25. Battle City begins a few days after this newspaper is printed, suggesting  Battle City  takes place no later than September. 
 
 ↑   Although Battle City took place before the end of September, it is unclear how long before. 
 
 ↑   This event takes place not long before Yugi's graduation. 
 
 ↑   Yugi started high school in 1996. Japanese high school lasts thee years, with graduation in March. 
 
 ↑   The year the  Yu-Gi-Oh! GX  manga is set is not specified within the series, but is assumed to be the same as the anime.
