 This monster appears in the artwork of " Xyz Tribalrivals ", " Arrivalrivals ", " Staring Contest ", and " Get Out! ". 
 According to the  Master Guide 4  monster stories, [1]  "Alchemic Magician" is the rival and best-friend of " Slacker Magician ". Both are well-known potion masters who studied together and now run a potion shop. However, due to her introverted personality, "Slacker Magician" stopped working, staying at her house all day long. After the incessant attempts of "Alchemic Magician" to cheer her up, she returned to business, while also creating the popular potion " Stim-Pack ". 
 "Alchemic Magician" and "Slacker Magician" also seem to be friends and/or rivals of " Akashic Magician " according to the scenes shown in the artworks of "Arrivalrivals" and "Staring Contest". Her and "Akashic Magician" are probably not really on good terms with each other.
