 Sending cards to the Graveyard 
 Cards can be sent to the Graveyard in many ways:
 
 A  Normal ,  Quick-Play  or  Ritual   Spell Card , or a  Normal  or  Counter   Trap Card  will be sent to the Graveyard after the whole  Chain  in which it was activated in  resolves  if it is still on the  field , unless it has an effect that keeps it on the field (such as " Swords of Revealing Light "). 
 A  Spell  or  Trap Card  will be sent to the Graveyard at the end of the  Chain  it was activated in if its  activation  was  negated , if it has not already been moved somewhere. 
 If a player already controls a  Field Spell Card , the existing Field Spell Card will be sent to the Graveyard immediately before that player activates another Field Spell Card. 
 A monster will be sent to the Graveyard after its  Summon  is negated, if it has not already been moved somewhere. 
 If a monster would be Summoned, but there is no free  Monster Zone  for it. (For example, " Juragedo " activates its effect to Special Summon itself, but " Ojama Trio " is chained so that there are no free Monster Zones when it resolves.) 
 An  excavated  card that cannot be moved to the proper location. (For example, cards that would be  added  to the  hand  or  Special Summoned  by " Cyber Jar " while " Deck Lockdown " is active.) 
 A temporarily  banished  monster that would return to the field will be sent to the Graveyard if there is no free Monster Zone for it or if it is a  Trap Monster . 
 Fusion Materials  are sent to the Graveyard when used for a  Fusion Summon . 
 Synchro Materials  are sent to the Graveyard when used for a  Synchro Summon . 
 Link Materials  are sent to the Graveyard when used for a  Link Summon . 
 Xyz Materials  are sent to the Graveyard if the  Xyz Monster  they are  attached  to  leaves the field . 
 By card that specifically uses this term (as a  cost ,  effect , or as part of a  Summoning condition ), like " Elemental HERO Prisma ", " Darkfall " and " Elemental HERO Neo Bubbleman ". 
 As a result of:
 being  Tributed 
 being  destroyed 
 being  discarded 
 being  detached 
 Actions that send to the Graveyard 
 Tribute ,  destroy ,  discard  and  detach  are different ways of sending cards to Graveyard. 
 Cards sent from the hand to the Graveyard are not necessarily discarded. For example, the effect of " The Fabled Cerburrel " activates when it is discarded to the Graveyard, so it will activate if discarded by " Card Destruction " but not when sent to the Graveyard by " Hand Destruction ".
 Likewise, cards sent from the field to the Graveyard are not necessarily destroyed. For example, the effect of " Dark End Dragon " sends monsters to the Graveyard, so it cannot be  negated  by cards such as " Stardust Dragon ". However, doing so will activate the effects of " Sangan " and " Dandylion ", which they activate when sent to the Graveyard, regardless of whether they were destroyed or not.
 
 Moving cards to the Graveyard without sending 
 Returning  a  banished  card to the  Graveyard  is not considered to be "sending a card to the Graveyard". [1]  Thus, even if a card like " Macro Cosmos " is active, " Miracle Dig " and " Fortune's Future " can be used to return cards to the Graveyard; the returned cards will not be banished.
 Swapping the  Main Deck  with the  Graveyard  for the effect of " Exchange of the Spirit " is not considered sending to the Graveyard. [2] [3]
