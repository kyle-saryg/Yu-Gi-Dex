 Major Events 
 When a player's LP reach 0, the glass floor under them will break, opening a vortex that will suck them into the  Shadow Realm  (in the Japanese version, the loser simply plunges to their death) 
 Joey ,  Téa  and  Mokuba  are held hostage. Mokuba will later escape but Joey and Téa are brainwashed by  Marik 's  Millennium Rod  and the former is forced to duel  Yugi . 
 Featured Duel: Yami Yugi and Seto Kaiba vs. Lumis and Umbra, Part 1 
 Turn 1: Lumis 
 Lumis  draws. He then  Sets  two cards.
 Turn 2: Yami Yugi 
 Yami Yugi  draws. He then  Normal Summons  " Beta The Magnet Warrior " (1700/1600) in  Defense Position .
 Turn 3: Umbra 
 Umbra  draws. He then  Normal Summons  " Shining Abyss " (1600/1800) in  Defense Position .  Lumis  then  activates  his face-down " Mask of Brutality ",  equipping  it to "Shining Abyss" and increasing its  ATK  by 1000 as well as decreasing its DEF by 1000 ("Shining Abyss": 1600 → 2600/1800 → 800). During each of Lumis' Standby Phases, he must pay 1000 Life Points or else "Mask of Brutality" will be destroyed.  Umbra  then  activates  " Masked Doll " to  negate  the cost of "Mask of Brutality".
 Turn 4: Kaiba 
 Kaiba  draws. He then  Sets  two cards. Kaiba's hand contains " Saggi the Dark Clown ", " Monster Reborn ", "Vorse Raider", and " Battle Ox ". Kaiba then  Normal Summons  " Vorse Raider " (1900/1200) in  Attack Position .
 Duel continues in the next episode 
 
 Changes to the English Version 
 The blood on  Bakura 's bandage is edited out in the dub. 
 When  Solomon  loads  Bakura  into the taxi, the word "TAXI" appears on the door and was erased in the dub. 
 When Marik communicates with Lumis and Umbra, Slifer and Obelisk are shown. 
 Most of the fight between  Joey  and the  Rare Hunters  is cut, including the important part when Marik is attacked multiple times by his servants to make him seem more convincingly like their friend Namu. The scenes not cut out are switched around a little, such as when Joey is first punched in the original and lands at Marik's feet before Marik is grabbed, this happens  after  Marik is grabbed (without showing the strike) to show Joey is "out cold" in the dub. Also, when the fight ends and the Rare Hunters grab Tea's cell phone, Joey is out cold after being attacked more than once in the original, but in the dub after landing at Marik's feet, he actually isn't unconscious yet and speaks to them about taking her phone and other matters when lying on the ground. 
 In the dub, you can hear Mokuba calling for Seto Kaiba's help when he is captured, but in the original, the helicopter drowns out Mokuba's voice and you only see his mouth moving. 
 In the Japanese Version, when the player loses, the glass will break and the player falls to their death. In the dub if the player loses the glass will break and he will get sent to the  Shadow Realm . 
 A pair of explosives affixed on each Life Point box are removed in the dub. 
 The cracks on the glass are made glowy in the dub. 
 " Masked Doll " is redesigned a little in the dub. 
 The dub adds a flashback to two episodes ago when Yugi and Kaiba dueled  Rare Hunter 2  and  Rare Hunter 3 , with Lumis explaining that he and Umbra are respectively those two duelists. This is not said in the original. 
 Errors 
 When Lumis pointed to the building as to where the Duel will take place, the building (not counting the windows) was gray-colored.  During every other subsequent shot of the skyscraper, it was in a more yellowish tint. 
 In the dub, before Umbra plays "Masked Doll", we see a shot of his  Duel Disk  with "Shining Abyss" on the Field.  Due to what looks like a greenish tint on the "Shining Abyss" card, it seems that it might of been mistakenly labeled as a  Spell Card . 
 After Kaiba summons Vorse Raider, there are 3 cards left in his hand, and we see another shot of him holding only 3, but then he has more, and this is before his next Draw Phase. 
 In the dub, Umbra says that Masked Doll negates the effect of  his  "Mask of Brutality" but Lumis was the one that activated it. 
 In the Japanese version, when Kaiba comments that he has a level six monster in his hand, it shows him holding "Saggi the Dark Clown", which is a level 3 monster. The English dub corrects this by replacing that card with "Dragon Seeker".
