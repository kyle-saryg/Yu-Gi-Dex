      The candy store.     
 Old Man Dentures' candy store  is a shop in the  Yu-Gi-Oh!  manga . It is owned by a grumpy man, known as " Old Man Dentures ". Outside the shop is a  Capsule Monster Chess   dispenser .
 
 Events 
 The shop would often have a group of children gather around its  Capsule Monster Chess  dispenser after school.  Yugi Mutou  went there one day to get  Capsule Monsters . Yugi was cut in the queue and after he managed to regain his spot, his Â¥100 got stuck in the machine. As he rattled the machine to unstick it, Old Man Dentures came out, thumped him on the head and lectured him on how expensive the machine was. The commotion was quietened down by the appearance of  Mokuba Kaiba , who forced Yugi away to play  a game  of  Capsule Monster Chess  and paid Dentures to let them take the dispenser. However he had previously rigged the machine to help him in his upcoming game and got Dentures to act out his part.
