 "Wisel"  (ワイゼル  Waizeru ) is an  archetype  used by  Primo  in  Yu-Gi-Oh! 5D's . It is a group of monsters that all act as one complete monster. Each part has its own effect. The strongest known versions of the parts are " Wisel Attack 5 ", " Wisel Guard 3 ", " Wisel Top 3 " and " Wisel Carrier ".
 All of them are Level 1,  Machine - Type  monsters. All of the pieces on the cards are surrounded by a green light. There are 5 basic parts but there is also one called " Wise Core " which  Special Summons  all of them to the field when it is destroyed by a card effect. Some parts have upgraded versions - " Wisel Top 3 ", " Wisel Attack 3 ", " Wisel Guard 3  and " Wisel Attack 5 ". Judging by Primo's usage of Skiel parts, Wisel Carrier does not appear to have an upgraded version. Still, he may have used them because they have better and more powerful effects than Wisel Carrier upgrades, if they exist at all.
 When the "Wisel" pieces are combined, they form a human-like robot. There are two other "Meklord Emperor" monsters, " Skiel ", which when combined forms a bird-like being, and also " Granel ", a giant cyclops/ogre/golem.
 There is a real-life Wisel card, which functions as a single Monster and does not have the Top/Carrier/Attack/Guard cards (also lacking the upgrades). The anime version of Wisel and all its "parts" appear in  Tag Force 5  &  6 .
