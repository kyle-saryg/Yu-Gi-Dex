 When this card was released outside Japan, it was redrawn to make it look like " Alchemic Magician " is holding the wrist of " Slacker Magician " instead of pinching her cheek, as well giving the latter a less cartoony expression, and, strangely enough, removing the white fur from her dress' neckline, something that wasn't done on her dress on her other appearances.
