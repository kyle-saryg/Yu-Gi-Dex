 Turn 1: Mimi 
Mimi's hand contains " 3K Bolt ", " One-Length LaMoon ", " Kanan the Ganguro Swordsmistress ", " Bubbly Elf ", and " All-Night Fever ". Mimi Normal Summons "One-Length LaMoon" (1200/0), "Kanan the Ganguro Swordsmistress" (1400/0), and "Bubbly Elf" (800/0). Mimi activates "All-Night Fever", allowing her to change all Aqua monsters she controls to face-up Defense Position and gain 400 LP for each monster changed to Defense Position this way. "One-Length LaMoon", "Kanan", and "Bubbly Elf" are changed to Defense Position (Mimi: 4000 --> 5200 LP). Mimi Sets 1 Card.
 Turn 2: Yuga 
Yuga's hand contains "Piercing!", "Dark Liberation", "Spell Archer", "Dark Sorcerer", and "Sevens Road Magician". Yuga Normal Summons "Spell Archer" (1000/0) and "Dark Sorcerer" (1500/0). Yuga Tributes "Spell Archer" and "Dark Sorcerer" to Tribute Summon "Sevens Road Magician" (2100/1500). Yuga activates the effect of "Sevens Road Magician", allowing him to send the top card of his Deck to the GY to increase its ATK by 300 for each monster with a different Attribute in his GY until the end of the turn. Yuga sends "Luminous Shaman" from the top of his Deck to the GY, so there are 3 monsters with different Attributes in his GY ("Sevens Road Magician": 2100/1500 --> 3000/1500). Yuga activates "Piercing!", allowing him to grant a monster he controls piercing battle damage this turn. He chooses "Sevens Road Magician". Yuga Sets 1 Card. "Sevens Road Magician" attacks and destroys "Kanan", with the effect of "Piercing!" inflicting piercing battle damage (Mimi: 5200 --> 2200 LP).
 Turn 3: Mimi 
Mimi's hand contains "Kanan the Ganguro Swordmistress", "One-Length LaMoon", " Dian Keto the Gold-digging Master ", "Bubbly Elf", and " Mirror Ball ". Mimi Tributes "Bubbly Elf" and "One-Length LaMoon" to Tribute Summon "Dian Keto the Gold-digging Master" (2500/1000). Mimi activates the effect of "Dian Keto", allowing her to send a card from her hand to the GY to gain 1000 LP. She sends "Bubbly Elf" to the GY (Mimi: 2200 --> 3200 LP). Mimi Normal Summons "Kanan" (1400/0) and "One-Length LaMoon" (1200/0). Since Mimi controls 3 face-up Aqua monsters, she activates her face-down "3K Bolt", allowing her to make the ATK of a Level 8 or lower monster Yuga controls 0 until the end of the turn. She chooses "Sevens Road Magician" ("Sevens Road Magician": 2100/1500 --> 0/1500). Mimi Sets 1 Card. "Dian Keto" attacks and destroys "Sevens Road Magician" (Yuga: 4000 --> 1500 LP). "Kanan" attacks Yuga directly, but Yuga activates his face-down "Dark Liberation", allowing him to return 4 Spellcaster monsters from his GY into his Deck to destroy all Attack Position monsters Mimi controls. Yuga returns "Spell Archer", "Dark Sorcerer", "Luminous Shaman", and "Sevens Road Magician", destroying "One-Length LaMoon", "Dian Keto", and "Kanan".
 Turn 4: Yuga 
Yuga's hand contains " Brave of Dawn, Lydacross ", "Magical Beast Wolfram", "Stray Familiar", "Hydro Magician", and "Hilt the Noble Arms Bearer". Yuga Normal Summons "Stray Familiar" (0/1400) and "Magical Beast Wolfram" (1100/0). Yuga Tributes "Stray Familiar" and "Magical Beast Wolfram" to Tribute Summon "Brave of Dawn, Lydacross" (2100/1500). Since Yuga Normal Summoned a Level 5 or higher monster, Mimi activates her face-down "Mirror Ball", allowing her to Special Summon a Aqua monster from her GY. She Special Summons "Dian Keto" (2500/1000) in Attack Position. Yuga activates the effect of "Lydacross", allowing him to return 2 Spellcaster monsters from his GY to his Deck to Special Summon 2 Level 5 or lower Spellcaster monsters from his hand. He returns "Stray Familiar" and "Magical Beast Wolfram", and Special Summons "Hydro Magician" (1700/1500) and "Hilt the Noble Arms Bearer" (1300/500), both in Attack Position. Yuga activates the effect of "Hilt", allowing him to increase the ATK of a Warrior monster he controls by 600 until the end of the turn. He increases the ATK of "Lydacross" ("Lydacross": 2100/1500 --> 2700/1500). "Lydacross" attacks and destroys "Dian Keto" (Mimi: 3200 --> 3000 LP). "Hydro Magician" and "Hilt" attack Mimi directly (Mimi: 3000 --> 1300 --> 0 LP).
