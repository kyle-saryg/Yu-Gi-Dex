 Solid Vision with mass has plunged the world into the era of Action Duels. Yuya Sakaki, a Dueltainer, has come to this time in search of the Genesis Omega Dragon (G.O.D.). Reiji Akaba, who is pursuing Yuya and G.O.D., has also arrived in this time shortly before Yuya. Having become the the president of the Leo Corporation, he sends his company's Duelist—Sawatari, Kurosaki and Sora—after Yuya. Finally, Yuya and Akada face off in person. However, a masked man named Ren breaks into their Duel, canceling it. Ren targets Yuya because he has the Adam Factor, but Yuya defeats him with a Duel Runner. Meanwhile, Akaba duels Ren's cohort Isaac and in space. Who will win?! [2]

 Message from Shin Yoshida 
 I always have a terrible time choosing Duel locations. They also influence how a Duel develops! Somebody take me to a world nobody's even seen before and give me ideas to work with! [2] 
 
 Message from Naohito Miyoshi 
 The "ARC-V" manga has entered its second half! What destinies await Yuya's and Eve's sides of the conflict? Is there any way to save them all? No doubt their Duels will be the determining factor! [2]
