" Ai of the Beholder ", known as " Unwavering Instinct " is the one-hundredth-and-first episode of  Yu-Gi-Oh! VRAINS  anime. It aired in Japan on May 8, 2019. It aired in English on Teletoon on January 10, 2021
 Bohman  set up something called a Neuron Link to use the consciousness of humans to create his  Data Storm . The three  Knights ,  Akira , and  Ghost Gal  put their lives on the line in an effort to destroy this Neuron Link. They succeeded, but Bohman then started repairing the Neuron Link right afterward, leaving  Playmaker  in despair. Playmaker is now in a hopeless pinch. Thus, Ai decides to go for a dangerous gambit!!
 
 Featured Duel: Playmaker vs. Bohman 
 Duel continues from the previous episode . 
 Turn 4: Playmaker 
 Bohman  attempts to activate his  Skill  but he fails. Bohman  activates  the effect of " Chimera Hydradrive Dragrid ", removing a  Hydradrive Counter  to roll a dice and return "Dragrid" to the Extra Deck to summon a " Draghead " monster that corresponds to the result from the Extra Deck. He rolls a 5 (LIGHT), but since he has no LIGHT "Draghead" monsters in his Extra Deck, it resolves with no effect. " Cyberse Clock Dragon " attacks and destroys "Dragrid" (Bohman: 4000 → 2500 LP).
 Turn 5: Bohman 
Bohman activates " Hydradrive Readvent ", Special Summoning 1 " Hydradrive " monster from his  GY  with its effect negated whose ATK is less then Playmaker's highest ATK monster. He targets "Dragrid". Bohman then activates the  Link Spell  " Judgment Arrows " (↖↑↗). Bohman activates his Skill, "Master Storm Access", accessing the Neural Link once per turn and adding a random  Cyberse  monster to his Extra Deck. He uses "Dragrid" to  Link Summon  " Perfectron Hydradrive Dragon " (0/LINK-5/←↙↓↘→). As it was summoned, its effect places 5 Hydradrive Counters on itself and it gains 1000 ATK for each Hydradrive Counter on it ("Perfectron": 0 → 5000 ATK). 
 "Perfectron" attacks "Clock Dragon", but Playmaker activates " Return Risk Reservoir ", allowing him to Special Summon a Level 1 monster from his GY. He Special Summons " Protron ". The other effect of "Risk Reservoir" allows Playmaker to  draw a card . He then activates the effect of " Linkuriboh " in his GY, Tributing "Protron" to Special Summon itself from the GY. A  replay  occurs and "Perfectron" attacks "Clock Dragon", but Playmaker activates the other effect of "Linkuriboh", Tributing itself to change the ATK of an attacking monster to 0 until the end of the turn ("Perfectron": 5000 → 0 ATK). Another replay occurs and "Perfectron" attacks "Clock Dragon" again. The attack fails, but the effect of "Perfectron" reduces all Battle Damage to 0 and by removing a Hydradrive Counter from itself prevents its destruction by battle. As it battled, the other effect of "Perfectron" activates, destroying all monsters Playmaker controls and inflicting 300 damage to Playmaker for every "Hydradrive" Link Monster in Bohman's GY. There are 8, so Playmaker takes 2400 damage (Playmaker: 2500 → 100 LP).
 Duel continues in the next episode .
