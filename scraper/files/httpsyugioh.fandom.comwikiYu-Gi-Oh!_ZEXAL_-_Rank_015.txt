 Summary 
 Trusting  Astral 's words,  Yuma  risks his life in the  Speed Field  in order to pass  Thunder Spark  and obtain victory.
 
 Featured Duel: Yuma Tsukumo vs. Thunder Spark 
 Duel continues from  the previous Rank . 
 Turn 10: Yuma 
 Yuma  passes  Thunder Spark , and the  Speed Duel  rules allow him to  Normal Summon  twice. He Summons 2  Level  4 monsters [Notes 1]  and  overlays  them to  Xyz Summon  " No. 50: Black Ship of Corn " (2100/1000). Yuma then  activates  its  effect ,  detaching  an Overlay Unit to  destroy  " No. 91: Thunder Spark Dragon ", but Spark activates his  face-down  card " Let Me Off Easy ",  paying  1000  Life Points  (Thunder Spark 4000 → 3000) to  negate  the effect of "Black Ship of Corn". Yuma  Sets  a card.
 Turn 11: Thunder Spark 
Spark activates the second effect of "Thunder Spark Dragon", detaching all 5 Overlay Units to destroy all cards Yuma  controls , but Yuma activates two  Trap Cards : " Ray of Hope " and " Ghost of a Grudge ". Due to the effect of "Ray of Hope", Yuma prevents his " No. 39: Utopia " from being destroyed by the effect of "Thunder Spark Dragon", and due to "Ghost of a Grudge", as Spark has 8 or more monsters in his  Graveyard , the  ATK  of "Thunder Spark Dragon" is reduced to 0 (2400 → 0).
 Turn 12: Yuma 
Yuma activates " Monster Reborn ",  Special Summoning  "Black Ship of Corn" from his Graveyard. He attacks and destroys "Thunder Spark Dragon" with "Black Ship of Corn" (Thunder Spark 3000 → 900), while "Utopia" attacks Spark  directly  (Thunder Spark 900 → 0).
