      The Meadow terrain     
 The  Meadow  field (also known as  Sogen ,  Grassland , and  Plain ) was shown briefly in  Duelist Kingdom . It was used by  Joey Wheeler  to power-up his  Warrior - Type  monsters. In the manga, it is specified that the Meadow also powers up Beast-Warrior-Type monsters, but Katsuya Jonouchi's " Battle Steer " received no advantage (although it's possible that it was played in the wrong  Zone ).
 In early video games, the field can be changed to Meadow by activating " Sogen " which grants the  ATK  and  DEF  changing effects of Sogen to the affected area.
