 The  Ancient Treasures   are a  series  of cards used by  Tenzen Yanagi , as well as  Yusei Fudo  briefly, in the  Yu-Gi-Oh! 5D's  anime. According to the anime, it is possible that these cards are  illegal , but currently that is not a problem. This series focuses on  Rock   monsters  with 0  ATK  to do its bidding, and nearly all of the cards have a negative  effect  ( paying   LP ,  discarding , etc.). These cards work well with " Curse Reflection Doll " and " Triangle O " to deflect the negative effects, however. With the exception of " Ashoka Pillar ", all members of this series have 0  DEF . 
 These cards are based on ancient objects from various locales around the world. Its theme would later be reused in the form of the " Chronomaly "  archetype  by  Trey  in  Yu-Gi-Oh! ZEXAL .
