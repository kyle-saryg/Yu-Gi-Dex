 Dungeon of Doom  is the eleventh volume of the Japanese  Yu-Gi-Oh!  manga  and the fourth volume of the English  Yu-Gi-Oh! Duelist  manga. Both versions are the same aside from number and series name; also, the English version removed the level stars from the cards on the cover for unknown reasons.
 In the foreword,  Kazuki Takahashi  mentions that due to a busy schedule, he was unable to design some of the monsters as carefully as he'd have liked to. There was a number of designs he was unsatisfied with. One such example was " Gate Guardian ", which he felt he could have made look cooler.
