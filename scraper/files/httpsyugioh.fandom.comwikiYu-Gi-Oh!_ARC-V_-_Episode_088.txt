 Summary 
       Yuya  and  Yuto  simultaneously command " Dark Rebellion " to use its  Treason Discharge effect  on " Raikiri ".     
 Crow  and  Yuya  drive down the highway, Crow on 2400  LP  and Yuya on 1400. Darkness continues to pour from Yuya and the implant in his helmet continues to send out electric shocks. Yuya activates the effect of " Dark Rebellion Xyz Dragon ".  Yuto  states that by detaching an  Overlay Unit , and  Yugo  states that until the end of the turn halve the  ATK  of a  Level 5  or higher monster his opponent controls.  Yuri  states that "Dark Rebellion" will gain that lost ATK as "Dark Rebellion" unfolds its wings and they begin crackling with electricity. Lightning snares " Assault Blackwing - Raikiri the Rain Shower " as Yuya and Yuto declare " Treason Discharge !" In her helicopter,  Melissa Trail  explains that the ATK of "Raikiri" will be halved to 1300 and that will be added to the ATK of Yuya's "Dark Rebellion" for a total of 3800, and a difference of 2500. Crow has 2400 LP, so if this attack hits Yuya will win. The  Topsiders  praise Yuya's imminent victory, commenting that one would never believe that Yuya was the same person who had those hippos dancing earlier (in the dub, one of them hopes that Yuya will beat Crow so she'll pick up her poodles from the spa). The  Commons  are furious that another guy with the Topsiders backing him will win, and they lament that their future is pitch-black now, while  Jack  watches impassively. 
 
       " Raikiri " is unaffected by " Dark Rebellion's " effect due to " Black Feather Cursed Guard ".     
 Crow states that he doesn't think so, activating the  Continuous Trap Card  " Black Feather Cursed Guard ". It negates the effect of "Dark Rebellion" and equips to "Raikiri". A large medallion materializes around "Raikiri's" neck, and  Jean-Michel Roget  calls Crow's struggling pointless. He muses that he'll need to help out a little. He contacts his staff to ask about an  Action Card , and one of his staff states that Course Point TD-6 has an Action Card. Roget tells them to let Yuya take that one. Meanwhile,  Sora  hangs from the wheel of Melissa's helicopter, gasping that something is definitely wrong and asking what is wrong with Yuya. Yuya activates the Pendulum effect of " Xiangke Magician ", once per turn he can target an  Xyz Monster  he controls and grant it a  Level  equal to its  Rank . "Xiangke Magician" infuses the  Rank 4  "Dark Rebellion Xyz Dragon" with a Level of  4 . Crow asks what Yuya is doing now. Yuya activates the Pendulum effect of " Xiangsheng Magician " in response, making the Level of one monster equal to the Level of another. "Xiangsheng Magician" fires an arrow and red energy suffuses " Odd-Eyes Pendulum Dragon " while purple energy suffuses "Dark Rebellion Xyz Dragon" as "Dark Rebellion" becomes  Level 7  like "Odd-Eyes". Seeing two Level 7 monsters, Crow realizes that Yuya is preparing to  Xyz Summon , and Sora realizes that Yuya is going to bring out  the monster  that he used in  their last Duel .
 
       The Summon of " Odd-Eyes Rebellion Dragon " blacks out the city.     
 Roget places a white pawn down, and he orders the staff to disconnect LK-3 and connect to TD-6. The road plates rise and begin to rotate on their pillars, and Roget tells Yuya to take this present from him. Yuri declares that he is using the Level 7 "Odd-Eyes Pendulum Dragon", and Yugo declares that he is using "Dark Rebellion Xyz Dragon", while Yuto declares the monster's overlaying and Yuya swings his arm skyward as he overlays the monsters. Yugo  chants , "Dragon of dual coloured eyes, eradicate all enemies who oppose you with your scale of wrath!" Yuya declares "Xyz Summon!" and Yuri chants, "Come forth!  Rank 7 !" Yuto chants, "Dragon with eyes of rage! Odd-Eyes Rebellion Dragon! ((Dub) " Two   savage  dragons meld their awesome powers to give rise to a monster that will send my enemies fleeing with dread! I Xyz Summon! Prepare to feel the wrath of Odd-Eyes Rebellion Dragon!)"
 " and his  counterparts  all join him for the final words of the monster's name as "Odd-Eyes Rebellion Dragon" appears with 3000 ATK. As it did the last time Yuya Summoned it while he was  out of control , "Odd-Eyes Rebellion Dragon" unleashes lightning blasts and powerful shockwaves that rock Crow and Sora, and are so intense that they cause the  ARC System  barriers on the roads to deactivate and cut main power in  New Domino City . The closing roads stop as well, leaving a large gap between them. Furious at the development, Roget slams his fist down, asking why it stopped. One of his staff explains that an external shock wave has destroyed the course changer's circuits, and another exclaims that the back-ups have been destroyed as well. She explains that they won't be able to bring them online right now. Roget clenches his teeth furiously.
 
         " Odd-Eyes Rebellion Dragon " equipped with " Supreme Wing ".     
 Yuya explains that when "Odd-Eyes Rebellion Dragon" is Xyz Summoned using "Dark Rebellion Xyz Dragon" as Xyz Material, it destroys all Level 7 or lower monsters Crow controls and deals damage equal to their ATK. He declares "Overlord Howling!" and "Odd-Eyes Rebellion Dragon" roars, sending out radial shockwaves. Crow activates the other effect of his Continuous Trap "Black Feather Cursed Guard", lowering the Level of "Raikiri" by 1 and its ATK by 400 to prevent its destruction. "Raikiri" glows yellow and falls to  Level 6  and 2200 ATK, while the three "Blackwing Tokens" are all destroyed. Melissa states that Crow has desperately defended "Raikiri" and fended off Yuya's ongoing onslaught. She wonders where the match will go from here, but then she looks down and she screams that there's nowhere to go as she sees the gap in the track; both of them are going to fall off at this rate. Crow replies that they shouldn't underestimate the  Blackbird , and he speeds up the track, accelerating ahead of Yuya and rocketing into the air. He swivels the handlebars and deploys the Blackbird's wings, yelling that the Blackbird won't fall that easily. Crow tells the Blackbird to take flight and fires its boosters, making it over the gap. Melissa cries that Crow flew as he touches down, and Sora yells "But Yuya..!" Yuya's  Duel Runner  soars over the gap, but it begins to fall. Yuya activates the  Equip Spell Card  " Supreme Wing " from his hand, equipping it to "Odd-Eyes Rebellion Dragon". Giant triangular wings of purple light appear along "Odd-Eyes Rebellion Dragon's" own wings, and it flies forwards to grab Yuya's Duel Runner in its hands. Melissa cries that Yuya flew too, and calls it amazing; now this is entertainment. The  Commons  cheer for Yuya, while the Topsiders praise  Crow . Crow wonders why the course change stopped partway. If Yuya really is in cahoots with the Topsiders then they would have been putting Yuya in more danger than Crow. 
 In the  Underground Labor Facility , trash pours from the pipes and is fed to the sorting line where  Frank ,  Amanda  and  Tarren  are sorting it, while  Zuzu  stands in the corner clutching  her bracelet . She tries to leave, but Frank hears her and asks where she's going. Tanner reminds her that  Gong  told them not to do anything on their own (in the dub, he says Zuzu will get mold control if she left). Zuzu protests that her bracelet shines whenever something is happening to Yuya, thus something is happening now. Tanner admits that it's a pretty strange bracelet and Amanda asks how Zuzu will even get to Yuya. Zuzu admits that she doesn't know. Tanner reminds her that all the guys in here were stated to be trustworthy by  Chojiro Tokumatsu , but as soon as they left the room they'd be caught by the guards. Amanda suggests that they just believe in Sora and wait (in the dub, she doesn't want Zuzu to get the cooties). Zuzu isn't convinced, and she looks at her bracelet worriedly. 
 
         Celina  tells  Moon Shadow  and  Riley  to go on without her.     
 Celina's bracelet  continues to glow as well, while  Celina  herself remains weak from the nerve gas and laments that at this rate,  Sector Security  will eventually find them. She tells  Riley  and  Moon Shadow  that it's enough already and that they should leave her behind. Riley turns around and asks her what she's saying. He gets up and vows to save Celina, but he sways and falls to his knees. Moon muses to himself that Riley is already at his limit; it seems that they won't be able to get much farther. 
 A scientist contacts Roget, desperately explaining that the device in Yuya's helmet has malfunctioned due to the shock wave. Roget is surprised, asking whether this means that it won't emit any more shocks. The scientist explains that it means the opposite; they can't stop it from emitting the maximum charge. If this continues his psyche and even his memory may be affected; in the worst case scenario his life could be at risk. 
 
         Crow  recoils in horror after seeing  Yuya's  vicious eyes.     
 On the highway, Crow drops back beside Yuya in concern, telling Yuya to answer him. He asks what happened to Yuya, and where the sincere boy who was talking to him at the start went. Yuya turns his head and Crow sees Yuya's glowing eyes and recoils in horror. Yuya activates the effect of "Odd-Eyes Rebellion Dragon", detaching an Overlay Unit to attack as many times as monsters were destroyed this turn. Crow realizes in horror that three "Blackwing Tokens" were destroyed this turn, and Yuya confirms that he gains the ability to attack three times. Yuya, Yuto, Yugo and Yuri all order "Odd-Eyes Rebellion Dragon" to attack "Raikiri the Rain Shower" with "Sweeping Static Strike". "Odd-Eyes Rebellion Dragon" plunges its tusks into the ground and dives forwards to attack, and Crow activates the effect of "Black Feather Cursed Guard" in response, preventing the destruction of "Raikiri". Yuya reminds Crow that he will take the damage, and Crow screams as his LP falls to 1600, before stating that the ATK of "Raikiri" will fall by 400 and its Level by 1. "Raikiri" falls to Level 5 and 1800 ATK. Melissa Claire cries that Crow somehow held on, but Yuya has two more attacks left; can Crow hold on? The scientist explains to Roget that the device in Yuya's helmet is still emitting its maximum charge, and if this continues Yuya's life could be in danger. Roget replies that it's fine if Yuya breaks, spooking the scientist (the reply is cut from the dub). He admits that it would be a shame to lose Yuya as his pawn in the future, but Yuya is living up to his expectations right now. Roget tells the scientist to look; everyone in the  Duel Palace  in entranced by Yuya's Dueling. 
 
         Yuri  emits darkness while commanding " Odd-Eyes Rebellion Dragon " to conduct a second attack.     
         Yugo  emits darkness while commanding " Odd-Eyes Rebellion Dragon " to conduct a second attack.     
 On the boat where he escaped from Yugo, Yuri is now emitting darkness like Yuya, and he orders the second attack of "Odd-Eyes Rebellion Dragon". In the streets on his Duel Runner, Yugo is also emitting darkness and he tells "Odd-Eyes Rebellion Dragon", "Get him!" 
 
         Yugo ,  Yuri  and  Yuto  command  Odd-Eyes Rebellion Dragon  to attack  Raikiri .     
 Yuto and Yuya order "Odd-Eyes Rebellion Dragon" to attack "Raikiri". "Odd-Eyes Rebellion Dragon" snarls and charges again, and Crow activates the effect of "Black Feather Cursed Guard" in response, negating the destruction of "Raikiri" again. He winces as his LP falls to 400, and as Melissa narrates, the ATK of "Raikiri" falls by 400 to 1400 and its Level falls by 1, to 4. Sora desperately wonders what has happened to Yuya; this kind of Dueling isn't like him at all. 
 Roget muses that it is almost time. He calls the Sector Security units outside of the Capital Building to attention; ordering them to storm the building and capture both  Declan Akaba  and the  High Council . After they have apprehended them; they must move to capture Zuzu Boyle and Celina (in the dub, he orders them to tell Declan and the High Council that the city is his now).  Sergey  listens to the orders from inside his van, and looks up with his left eye glowing red. Inside the Capital Building, the High Council monitor Sector Security and  Gael  muses that it looks like they're going to make their move.  Gray  states that even if Sector Security makes their way in here, and  Azul  finishes that she assumes that Declan will protect them again, correct?  Bordeaux  states that they are counting on Declan, correct, Chairman?  White Taki  agrees and states that they are relieved to have such a skilled Duelist as Declan watching over them. Declan doesn’t reply; instead he adjusts his glasses and looks at the screen depicting Yuya's  Turbo Duel . 
 
         The  Obelisk Force  appears in the  Synchro Dimension .     
 Hanging from the helicopter, Sora thinks that right now Yuya can't hear anyone. Sora might be able to do something if he joins this Duel. Yuya, Yuto, Yugo and Yuri all order the third attack of "Odd-Eyes Rebellion Dragon" with "Sweeping Static Strike", and "Odd-Eyes Rebellion Dragon" tears up the road again. Crow activates the effect of "Black Feather Cursed Guard" to prevent "Raikiri" from being destroyed, but as Melissa notes he only has 400 LP. Crow activates a  Trap Card , " Black Feather Hope ", paying half his LP to prevent the battle damage. "Raikiri" takes the attack, and it falls to  Level 3  and 1000 ATK, while Crow falls to 200 LP. Melissa praises Crow for being as tough as expected; the calling card of the Commons who have been trampled on but still stand up. Yuya angrily ends his turn (in the dub, he questions why Crow keeps delaying his demise) as "Odd-Eyes Rebellion Dragon" alights over his Duel Runner. Sora thinks to himself that "Odd-Eyes Rebellion Dragon" has 3000 ATK, so in order to match that he'd need to bring out his  strongest monster , but can he do that? Then he looks up in surprise to see several shapes silhouetted against the moon. Declan sees them too on the screen, and Sora narrows his eyes as he makes out the  Obelisk Force  flying with hang gliders equipped with searchlights.
 
         Sergey  smiles after being given his orders.     
 The appearance of the Obelisk Force sets off alarms at the Sector Security Headquarters as well, and one of Roget's staff states that numerous UFOs have been detected in New Domino City's airspace. Another states that 10… 15… no, 20 have been confirmed and they have a visual. Roget rises from his chair in shock when he sees the Obelisk Force;  Duel Academy  have arrived at a time like this. He muses that this is bad; their objective is definitely capturing Zuzu Boyle and Celina. He orders Sector Security to halt the operation; the Sector Security unit outside the Capital Building will hold their position and not let a single person leave. He orders Sergey to intercept the invading Obelisk Force, and Sergey looks up with a smile as his left eye glows red. 
 
         Sora  jumps onto  Crow's   Duel Runner .     
 Melissa states that both Yuya and Crow refuse to give way to their opponent's relentless attacks, and she wonders who will be the victor of this Duel. Then she finally notices Sora hanging from the wheels, and she asks him what he is doing, even if he wants to see the Duel up close, this is just rash. But Sora ignores her, musing that the Obelisk Force is a special unit directly under  the Professor's  command; and they're definitely after Zuzu and Celina. Sora remembers Yuya telling him that he wouldn't abandon Celina to that prison of a Duel Academy, nor Zuzu. Sora thinks that Moon took Zuzu underground, but if the higher ups of New Domino City have connections with Duel Academy, then there's no way that Celina was sent underground after losing her Duel (in the dub, he does not think about New Domino City's connection with Duel Academy). He begins swinging from the wheel just as Melissa begins working up the courage to get Sora into the helicopter, and Melissa screams that Sora jumped off. Crow feels a shock on his Duel Runner in surprise, and he turns to see Sora and rudely asks who the heck Sora is. Sora introduces himself as Sora Perse; Yuya's friend. He explains that Yuya isn't himself right now, so Sora needs Crow to bring Yuya back to his senses for him.  Crow asks what Sora is talking about, and Sora admits that he would have liked to do something about it himself, but he needs to protect Celina from those other guys. He looks at the Obelisk Force, and Crow looks up to see them as well, asking what they are. But Sora is already gone, and Crow thinks that Sora said that he was Yuya's friend. He realizes that something really is wrong with Yuya, and cheerfully vows to knock some sense into him; since he's Yuya's friend as well.
 
         Crow  grins at his draw.     
 He declares his turn and draws, and he is quite surprised at his draw, commenting that drawing this card means that he'd better prepare himself for the worst. He Summons the  Tuner monster  " Blackwing - Decay the Ill Wind ". Crow explains to Yuya that "Decay the Ill Wind" isn't your average Tuner monster; if the monster  Synchro Summoned  using "Decay" as  Synchro Material  is destroyed, the effect of "Decay" will cause Crow to lose the Duel. That means that the monster Crow is about to call forth using it is his final trump card; with this Crow is going to challenge Yuya's "Odd-Eyes Rebellion Dragon" to a battle to the death. He tunes the now-Level 3 "Raikiri" with his Level 4 "Decay the Ill Wind" and chants "Pitch-black wings, Along with dazzling rain, bring forth a strike of lightning! Synchro Summon! Pierce through!  Assault Blackwing - Chidori the Rain Sprinkling ! (Dub) "I Synchro Summon! My winged warrior,  Assault Blackwing - Chidori the Rain Sprinkling !")" 
 
         " Odd-Eyes Rebellion Dragon " explodes due to the effect of " Supreme Wing ".     
 Melissa cheers that Crow's trump card is on the field, but its ATK is only 2600 so it won't be able to take on Yuya's 3000 ATK  Dragon  like that. Crow grins and he explains that the ATK of "Chidori the Rain Sprinkling" is increased by 300 for every " Blackwing " monster in his  Graveyard . There are five "Blackwings" in Crow's Graveyard, so the ATK of "Chidori" increases by 1500, and lightning strike "Chidori" as it rises to 4100 ATK; Melissa states that Crow has overshot it by a huge number. Crow powerslides and he declares his  Battle Phase , ordering "Chidori" to attack "Odd-Eyes Rebellion Dragon". "Chidori" swoops in with its sword at the ready and "Odd-Eyes Rebellion Dragon" sweeps towards it with its fangs digging into the ground. Crow yells that he's putting his soul into this battle and he begs Yuya to come to his senses. They both scream as Crow declares, "One Strike of Lightning, Lightning Slash!" The two monsters dive across one another and strike. "Odd-Eyes Rebellion Dragon" crackles with electricity and its tusks snap from the blow. Both "Odd-Eyes Rebellion Dragon" and Yuya howl in pain as electricity shocks them and Yuya falls to 300 LP. The device in his helmet is destroyed, and Yuya explains as the glow in his eyes extends past his irises that the effect of "Supreme Wing" activates; the monster that destroys the equipped monster in battle is also destroyed. "Odd-Eyes Rebellion Dragon" is compressed into a spark of crimson energy, and Yuya, Yuto, Yuri and Yugo all explain that it will also inflict damage to that monster's owner equal to the ATK of the destroyed monster. The spark explodes with tremendous force, destroying "Chidori" and reducing Crow's LP to zero. The Blackbird is actually blasted off its wheels momentarily and deactivates, trailing smoke. The glow in Yuya, Yuri, and Yugo's eyes fades and the darkness surrounding them disappears as they all faint. Melissa gasps that the winner is Yuya; the winner of this semi-final match is Yuya Sakaki. 
 Moon carries Celina on his back as he and Riley walk into an underground canal. Riley notices Celina's bracelet stop glowing. Zuzu also notices her own bracelet stop glowing as she leans against the wall in the sorting line. 
 
         Jack  walks off, calling the Duel boring.     
 Melissa states that just when Crow's comeback seemed certain, Yuya let forth a burning counter. She suggests that Yuya might be able to give an even match to Jack now. But Jack is furious, he rises from his throne and dismisses the Duel as boring (in the dub, he muses that Yuya is still not in Jack's league) before turning on his heel and leaving. 
 
         Crow  tells  Yuya  that the  Obelisk Force  has arrived and that  Celina  is in danger.     
 Yuya wakes up to hear Crow calling his name, asking if Yuya can hear him. Yuya sees Crow in the grip of two of the stadium staff, and Crow happily observes that Yuya is finally back with them. Yuya asks in confusion what he did, and Crow tells Yuya to listen to him. Crow saw some suspicious guys show up during their Duel; it turns out that they're after Celina and Sora went to go and save her. Yuya is shocked that Sora is trying to save Celina now, and the stadium staff comment that Crow has said what he wanted to say, hasn’t he? They take him away, and Yuya cries Crow's name. Crow tells Yuya not to worry about him, and go now for his friends. Yuya grits his teeth and apologizes, before speeding off on his Duel Runner, much to Melissa's annoyance. She yells at Yuya to come back. Yuya exits the Duel Palace, and he notes that Sora informed Crow that someone was after Celina, and he wonders if Duel Academy have finally arrived in  this dimension . He thinks that right now he needs to find Sora, and accelerates down the highway.
 
 Featured Duel: Yuya Sakaki vs. Crow Hogan 
 Duel continues from the previous episode . 
 Turn 4: Yuya 
 Yuya   activates  the  effect  of " Dark Rebellion Xyz Dragon ",  detaching  an  Overlay Unit  to halve the  ATK  of a  Level  5 or higher  monster  his opponent  controls  and have "Dark Rebellion" gain ATK equal to that value. He chooses "Raikiri" ("Raikiri": 2600 → 1300/2000, "Dark Rebellion": 2500 → 3800/2000).  Crow   activates  his  face-down   Continuous Trap Card , " Black Feather Cursed Guard " as an opponent's effect is  targeting  a " Blackwing " monster he controls. The effect is  negated . Yuya activates the  Pendulum Effect  of " Xiangke Magician ", giving "Dark Rebellion" a Level equal to its current  Rank  ("Dark Rebellion":   4 →   4). Yuya activates the Pendulum Effect of " Xiangsheng Magician ", changing the  Level  of "Dark Rebellion" to that of another monster he controls. He targets " Odd-Eyes Pendulum Dragon " (2500/2000) ("Dark Rebellion":   4 → 7). Yuya  overlays  his two Level 7  Dragon - Type  monsters to  Xyz Summon  " Odd-Eyes Rebellion Dragon " (3000/2500) in  Attack Position . As it was Xyz Summoned using an  Xyz Monster  being treated as a Level 7 monster, the effect of "Rebellion Dragon" activates,  destroying  all Level 7 or lower monsters Crow controls and inflicting  damage  equal to the total ATK of those monsters to his opponent. Crow activates the other effect of "Cursed Guard", preventing the destruction of "Raikiri" by decreasing its ATK by 400 and its Level by 1 ("Raikiri": 2600 → 2200,   7 → 6). The effect of "Rebellion Dragon" destroys the three "Blackwing Tokens". Yuya  equips  " Supreme Wing " to "Rebellion Dragon", which will prevent the destruction of itself and the equipped monster by card effects. He activates the other effect of "Rebellion Dragon", detaching an Overlay Unit to let it  attack  a number of times this  Battle Phase , up to the number of opponent's monsters destroyed this turn. Since three "Blackwing Tokens" were destroyed, "Rebellion Dragon" can attack three times. "Rebellion Dragon" attacks "Raikiri" three times, but the effect of "Black Feather Cursed Guard" activates thrice, ("Raikiri": 2200 → 1800 → 1400 → 1000 ATK,   6 → 5 → 4 → 3, Crow: 2400 → 1600 → 400 LP). As a "Blackwing" monster he controls is  battling , Crow activates his face-down " Black Feather Hope ", halving his  LP  to reduce the  battle damage  to 0 on the last attack (Crow: 400 → 200 LP).
 
         " Assault Blackwing - Chidori the Rain Sprinkling " gains  ATK  for each " Blackwing " in in  Crow 's  Graveyard .     
 Turn 5: Crow 
Crow  draws  and subsequently  Normal Summons  " Blackwing - Decay the Ill Wind " (1000/1000). He  tunes  the Level 3 "Raikiri" with the Level 4  Tuner monster  "Decay the Ill Wind" to  Synchro Summon  " Assault Blackwing - Chidori the Rain Sprinkling " in Attack Position. [Notes 1]  "Chidori" gains 300 ATK for each "Blackwing" monster in Crow's  Graveyard . He has five - " Bora the Spear ", " Gale the Whirlwind ", "Decay the Ill Wind", " Calima the Haze " and "Raikiri" (2600 → 4100). "Chidori" attacks and destroys "Rebellion Dragon" (Yuya: 1400 → 300 LP), but the effect of "Supreme Wing" activates, destroying the attacking monster when "Rebellion Dragon" is  destroyed by battle  and inflicting damage to Crow equal to the ATK of "Chidori". "Chidori" is destroyed (Crow: 200 → 0 LP).

 Notes 
 
 ↑   " Assault Blackwing - Raikiri the Rain Shower " treats itself as a  Tuner monster  via its own  effect  when it is Summoned using " Blackwing "  monsters . This means  Crow  used two Tuner monsters for a  Synchro Summon , which should be impossible under most circumstances, though the full effects of " Blackwing - Decay the Ill Wind " and " Assault Blackwing - Chidori the Rain Sprinkling " are not known and could potentially explain this.
