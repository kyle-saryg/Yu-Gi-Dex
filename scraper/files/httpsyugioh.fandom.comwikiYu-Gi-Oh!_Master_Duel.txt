 Gameplay 
 Yu-Gi-Oh! Master Duel  is an official, free-to-play simulator based on the  Yu-Gi-Oh! Official Card Game  and  Trading Card Game . Players can purchase and collect digital cards, build decks, and challenge other players online in Duel Mode or battle through card stories and learn how to play in Solo Mode. Over 10,000 cards from the game are featured and are available to collect.
 
 Shop 
 New cards and cosmetic items can be acquired at the Shop. The Shop accepts Gems, a currency earned from completing missions, winning duels in Solo Mode, or purchasing them with real money. Gems can be exchanged for different types of Booster Packs; one Booster Pack contains 8 cards, and by purchasing 10 Boosters at once a Super Rare card or higher is guaranteed. Structure Decks containing fixed card lists are available for purchase for 500 Gems, up to 3 times per account. Bundles also allow you to buy Booster Packs with a set card as a bonus, such as the  Ash Blossom & Joyous Spring  Bundle. Gems can also be spent on items to customize your gameplay experience, including Mates, field designs, card protectors, and profile icons.
