 In this card's International artwork, her skirt is lengthened to remove sexual connotations. Also, the energy globe around her left hand is removed; it's possible that this was done because "Heiress" has her pointer finger outstretched, but the additional distortion of the energy globe made it look like she was giving  the finger , as all her other hand digits were barely visible.
