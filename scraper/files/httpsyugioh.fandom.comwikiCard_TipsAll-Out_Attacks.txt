 This card can be  searched  by " A Cat of Ill Omen " and " The Despair Uranus ". 
 This card's main purpose is to aid effects that  Special Summon monsters face-down , so that the monsters summoned immediately flip face-up and activate their  Flip effects  (or  Pseudo-Flip Effects ). Because of the not-once-per-turn nature of this effect,  OTKs  can be established with " Morphing Jar #2 " and several other  Flip monsters . 
 Similar to " Battle Mania ", this card can be combined with an " Amorphactor Pain, the Imagination Dracoverlord " you summoned on your previous turn, and an effect that Special Summons monsters to your opponent's field (such as " Ojama Trio ", " Nightmare Archfiends ", " Revival Gift " or " Foolish Revival ") so that they're forced to enter their Battle Phase and attack "Amorphactor Pain" with those monsters.
