An  Official Proxy  is a mock image of a card that is usually used in place of an unreleased card. These are commonly used in articles to advertise upcoming sets. Official Proxy images can be identified by the lack of  Passcode  and an  Eye of Anubis Hologram 
 Websites using Official Proxies include Konami's official Yu-Gi-Oh! sites and social media, as well as VIZ Media's official site. Official Proxies can also be found in issues of  Weekly Shōnen Jump  and  Shonen Jump , as well as on Sneak Peek posters.
 In recent  OCG  Official Proxies, a capitalized SAMPLE is normally written over the card's text field.
 Official Proxies are not guaranteed to match the released card, although they typically do. For example, " Seismic Crasher " had a different artwork on its Official Proxy to its eventual print, and several cards have had their card text changed before their release.
 
 Examples 
 An Offcial Proxy of " Shellrokket Dragon ". The Official Proxy of " Seismic Crasher " had its artwork replaced.
