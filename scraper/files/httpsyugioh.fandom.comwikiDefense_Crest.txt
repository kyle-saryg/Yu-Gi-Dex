Defense Crests  allow players to  defend  their monsters from their opponent's  attacks  in  Dungeon Dice Monsters .
 When a monster is declared an attack target, its controller can declare a Normal Defense by spending 1 Defense Crest from their  Crest Pool . If a Defense is declared by the effect of a monster or an item Defense Crests are not paid unless the activation cost requires them.
 There are certain monsters, such as " Gator Dragon " that require Defense Crests be paid as a cost for the activation of their effects.
