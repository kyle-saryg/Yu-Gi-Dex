 A  Card Number  (Japanese: カードナンバー  Kādo Nanbā ; not to be confused with the  eight-digit code  at the lower-left corner of cards) is the ID code found on most  OCG  and  TCG  cards, intended to denote the set from which the card originated, and its position in that set. Another purpose for card numbers is to help players distinguish a card's  Original Print  from its  Reprints .
 Card numbers are located immediately underneath the image on most cards, on the right-hand side. On  Pendulum Monsters , card numbers are placed on the bottom left corner of the card instead, in the same line as the  ATK / DEF  values, as the  Pendulum Effects  and the  Pendulum Scales  take up the space where the card number would usually be placed. On  Link Monsters , card numbers are aligned slightly further to the left compared to their placement on other cards (except Pendulum Monsters) because one of the arrows radiating from the art frame takes up the usual space for the number.
 The general format for card numbers is "SET-LN999", where "SET" is the two-, three-, or four-character set prefix, "LN" is the one- or two-letter regional abbreviation, and "999" is the set position number. Some older cards, depending on the region, did not have a regional abbreviation in their card number, and  Series 1  cards did not have a card number at all.  Limited Edition 2  is the first set to feature printed card numbers on its cards.
 A few cards have nonstandard card numbers, such as  SD1-ENDE1  (" Armed Dragon LV7 "), which, instead of the usual three-digit set position number, has "DE" and a one-digit number.
 See  OCG set prefixes  and  TCG set prefixes  for more information on set abbreviations, and  passcode  for the eight-digit number in a card's lower left-hand corner.
