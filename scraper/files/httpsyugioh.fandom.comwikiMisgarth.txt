      The crest of Misgarth.     
 Misgarth  is the kingdom governed by the royal family of  Prince Ojin .
 In the Japanese version of the anime the kingdom is called  Midgard  (ミズガルズ) as is earth’s name in Norse mythology. 
In addition the royal crest shows a snake like creature girding the world, referencing the tale of the Midgard World Serpent (Jörmungandr) which was so large it could grasp its own tail while surrounding the earth. 
 Though a small kingdom, they controlled  a satellite  that could be used to destroy (brainwash in the dub) all life on the planet. [1]
