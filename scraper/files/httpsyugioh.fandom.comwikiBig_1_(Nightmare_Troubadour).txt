 This is the depiction of Big 1 from  Yu-Gi-Oh! Nightmare Troubadour . He is the first of an 8-duel Boss battle that begins after the Beginners Cup. In the dialogue he still refers to himself by his actual name, Gansley, but the game itself simply refers to him by his alias. The Player duels him in a Shadow Game and wins, causing him to presumably get sent to the  Shadow Realm . His deck is overall similar in theme to his anime deck.
