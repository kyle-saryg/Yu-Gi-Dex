 Pharaoh Akhenamkhanen  is a character in the  Yu-Gi-Oh!  manga . He is the father of  Pharaoh Atem  and the first holder of the  Millennium Puzzle . This is the original version of Akhenamkhanen, known as  Aknamkanon  in the English anime.
 
 Biography 
 In Ancient Egypt, Akhenamkhanen was the previous Pharaoh with  Siamun Muran  and Akhenaden as advisers. He loved his country dearly and was (most likely) oblivious that his brother was secretly resentful and felt relatively unimportant. When Egypt was under attack, Akhenaden pushed to fight back and protect their people, but Akhenamkanen refused on the grounds as he wanted peace. Eventually, the invading armies grew too close to the palace to be repelled, and Akhenaden suggested using a spell from the  Millennium Tome  to create the  Millennium Items . Faced with the undeniable fact his kingdom may be destroyed, the Pharaoh agreed. 
 What Akhenamkhanen didn't know was that Akhenaden led a group of soldiers to the village of  Kul Elna , where he ordered the thieves there killed, and their blood collected for the ritual to create the items, unknowingly leaving  one survivor  of this slaughter. The slaughter was so horrific that Akhenaden never told Akhenamkanen of it, and had all the soldiers he had taken brainwashed so as to forget the incident. Upon the invading army's attack a week later, Akhenamkanen, along with Siamun, Akhenaden, and four other priests used the Millennium Items to defeat the army. 
 Sometime later, Aknamkanon finds out about the massacre from Priest  Mahado , who learned the secret from the  Millennium Ring , he sacrifices himself to the gods of Egypt as a penance in a state of guilt and shame believing that it was his own choice of option for allowing this to occur, asking only for his son's safety from their wrath in return. After the disturbing discovery, Akhenamkhanen grew ill and died. 
 Years later,  Thief King Bakura  carries Akhenamkhanen's sarcophagus in front of  Pharaoh Atem  (Akhenamkhanen's son) and his  Guardians  and places the blames on the late Akhenamkhanen for killing his  villagers  to make the Millennium Items (although it was actually Akhenaden that was responsible). Akhenamkhanen (through his corpse) speaks with Atem with the instructions " Justice is in the name of the Gods " or " Justice lies with the Egyptian gods ". Later, Akhenamkhanen's spirit again tells Atem the instructions "Justice is in the name of the Gods" is the key to defeating  Zorc Necrophades . After the  Ceremonial Battle , Akhenamkhanen is seen waiting for his son as he passes into the door between life and death along with the other guardians.
