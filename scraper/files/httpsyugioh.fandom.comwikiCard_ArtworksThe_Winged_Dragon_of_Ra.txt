 This card is drawn in different positions in its manga, Legal  OCG / TCG  and Illegal  OCG / TCG  artworks. 
 The 1st Legal  OCG / TCG  version represents the form that Ra assumes in the modern world: he has a dull yellow coloration, a bio-mechanical look, three-clawed "hands", a large tooth-filled beak, large thighs, smooth dragon-like wings and a long slender tail. 
 The 2nd Legal  OCG / TCG  version represents the form that Ra assumes in the Memory World: he has a gold coloration, four-clawed "hands", a small eagle-like beak, a more narrow face, an arch between his shoulders, feathery dragon-like wings, slender thighs, a small vestigial claw on his heels and a bird-like tail.
