 Lords of Shining  is an original pack in the video game  Yu-Gi-Oh! Duel Links . It was first released in-game on April 30, 2019.
 
 Description  
 Elemental HERO The Shining or Darklords... LIGHT or DARK, which side will you choose? 
 
 Featuring: 
" Elemental HERO The Shining ", This monster gains 300 ATK for each banished " Elemental HERO " monster! 
In addition, when this monster is sent from the field to the Graveyard, you can add 2 banished "Elemental HERO" cards to your hand! 
Fusion Summon with the "Elemental HERO" monsters you added to your hand for a comeback victory! 
" The White Stone of Ancients ", A Tuner Monster that Special Summons a " Blue-Eyes " monster from your Deck, as well as lets you add a "Blue-Eyes" monster in your Graveyard to your hand. 
Both these effects require this monster to be in the Graveyard, so use it as a Synchro Material to send it to the Graveyard! 
" The Deep Grave ", A Trap Card that lets you Special Summon a monster from either player's Graveyard during your next turn. 
There's no limitation to the monster you can Summon, so Special Summon a powerful monster that was sent there earlier! 
" Darklord Ixchel ", When this card is in your hand, you can discard it alongside another " Darklord " card to draw 2 cards. 
When it's on the field, you can use the effect of a "Darklord" Spell/Trap Card in your Graveyard. 
Both effects will help out your "Darklord" Deck immensely!  
A total of 40 types of Cards: 3  UR , 10  SR , 17  R , and 20  N .
