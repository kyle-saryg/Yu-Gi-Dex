 Best Friends!! 
 
 Two Big Brothers!!  is the eighth chapter of the  Yu-Gi-Oh! GX manga . It was first printed in Japanese in the  V Jump  magazine and in English in the  Shonen Jump  magazine. Both of which were printed in  volume 1  of the Yu-Gi-Oh! GX graphic novels afterwards.
 
 Summary 
 The chapter opens with  Syrus Truesdale  declaring an  attack  against an unseen opponent with his " Tankroid ". His opponent is revealed on the next page to be  Jaden Yuki , who has  activated  " Hero Barrier " to  negate  the attack against his " Elemental Hero Lady Heat ". Syrus has 3700  Life Points , and Jaden has a full 4000. Syrus  Sets  a card to end his turn. Syrus knows he has to win his duel to stay at  Duel Academy , and Jaden knows that too - but if Jaden loses, his Deck will be confiscated, and he can't let that happen.
 Flashbacks are shown to the previous day, revealing how it got to his point.  Dr. Crowler  arrives at the office of the teacher in charge of the  Slifer Red  first-years,  Professor Hibiki . He's come to pick up the mid-term grade evaluations, but the other professor is nowhere to be found. Crowler then remembers that Hibiki has gone on a business trip until the next day, but finds the mid-term grades in the printer. He sees one student with a grade of zero. Elsewhere, at the school's computer lab, Jaden and Syrus are checking up Syrus' brother  Zane  on the computer. He's studying abroad at the American branch of  Duel Academy , and the article says he's representing Duel Academy well. The picture shows him standing with " Cyber End Dragon " behind him.  Bastion Misawa  comments that Zane and  Atticus Rhodes  are the stars of the Academy, and is jealous that they get to study abroad. Jaden asks why Syrus refers to him as "big brother", when he already has a real big brother. Dr. Crowler arrives before he can answer, and states that he'd like to know how Syrus could be related to Zane, and decides to expel him, revealing that Syrus' midterm score was zero.
 Crowler decides to give Syrus a chance to stay, and seeing as this is  Duel  Academy after all, he declares that Syrus will duel Jaden. Should Syrus win, he'll be allowed to stay. Bastion and  Alexis  are surprised, and think that Jaden could simply forfeit the duel. Knowing that's a possibility, Crowler states that should Jaden lose, his entire Deck will be confiscated, citing the fact that Jaden has failed every written exam he's taken since entering Duel Academy as justification. That night, Syrus cannot sleep, and sits on the porch of the Slifer dorm. He wants to stay at the academy to prove to his brother that he can be a duelist, as his brother once told him he was too kind of a person to get anywhere in the dueling world. Syrus informs Jaden that he wants him to duel him with all his skill.
 
       Syrus '  armor .     
 The duel resumes, and Jaden uses his " Elemental Hero Stratos " to attack and destroy "Tankroid". Syrus activates his  face-down  " Return Ticket ", letting him  Special Summon  another "Tankroid" from his Deck, while the effect of the first activates, allowing him to draw one card. Jaden ends his turn, and Syrus begins his, drawing the card his brother gifted him with as a child - " Transformation ". Syrus activates " Tune Up ", increasing the attack of "Tankroid" by 300, and then uses it to attack and destroy "Lady Heat". Syrus Sets "Transformation" to end his turn. Jaden isn't having fun, but Syrus wanted him to duel with all his skill, so he activates the effect of "Stratos", which lets him attack Syrus  directly  with it by halving its attack points. However, Syrus remains unscathed, as he's activated "Transformation", which gives him armor resembling the " Blue-Eyes White Dragon ". This has reduced the damage to zero and destroyed "Stratos".

 Duel begins from an unspecified  turn . Jaden has " Elemental Hero Lady Heat " (1300/1000) in  Defense Position , one  Set  card and 4000  Life Points , while Syrus has " Tankroid " (1500/1900) in  Attack Position  and 3700 Life Points.

 Jaden's turn 
Jaden  Summons  " Elemental Hero Stratos " (1800/300), and uses it to attack and  destroy  "Tankroid" (Syrus: 3700 → 3400).
