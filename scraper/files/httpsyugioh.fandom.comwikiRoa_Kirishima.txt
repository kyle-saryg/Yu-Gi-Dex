 Appearance 
       Full-body image of Roa.     
       Young Roa.     
 Roa is a slim young boy with purple eyes and light green spiky hair with three prongs over his eyes in a "T" shape. He wears dark magenta pink t-shirt with a light purple crossed sword symbol on the chest, two light purple wristbands and black pants with purple ribbons wrapped around the shins. He also wears black shoes.
 
 Personality 
 In contrast of his career as a band leader, Roa has two sides: one where he appears as an altruistic optimistic and confident young man who cares for his fans as he like to grin while dueling, when in actuality he is a very arrogant opportunistic and conceited person. He declares he will be the new owner of Rush Dueling, calling it 'RoaRush Duel'. He appears to have no issues with using shady methods to win or gain advantage in duels, and appears at first to use conniving tactics but when he genuinely tries he is shown to be a very skilled and formidable duelist. He also is quite the manipulative trickster to his cousin  Romin  as he is willing to get information on the Rush Duels by acting like he is a friend to Yuga and co. His conniving and tactical personality is shown due to him setting a trap to set his match up with Yuga about "Sevens Road Magician's" legal qualities to automatically disqualify him.
 He is also self-agrrandizing as he proclaimed himself the "Duel King" which is what his Deck represents.
 
 Biography 
 History 
 Roa was present in a small tournament sponsored by  Goha Corp . where he watches  Otes  duel, and get disqualified for owning " Sevens Road Magician ", which is an illegal card made by Otes. It was later unveiled that Otes was disqualified since he was a member of Goha, rather than "Sevens Road Magician" being an illegal card.
 
 Birth of Rush Duels 
 In a dark room, Roa was shown to have received pictures of Yuga Ohdo from Romin. He smirked watching the pictures, saying Yuga's name and Rush Duel.
 
 Deck 
 Roa uses a " Royal Demon's " Deck . His overall strategy is using the Rush Duel rules to empty his opponent's Deck by sending cards from their hand to the Graveyard, and then forcing them to draw cards to shorten their deck. In hindsight his strategy in his Duel with Yuga with this method is to accelerate the chances for Yuga to draw " Sevens Road Magician " which at the time was thought to be an illegal card, that would have automatically disqualified him the moment he drew it. He also includes several high-level monsters that gain additional effects when other high-level monsters are used to summon them.
 His "King" cards also represent his declaration of calling himself the next "Duel King".

 Trivia 
 Roa calling himself the "Duel King" is comparable to  Jack Atlas , who calls himself as the "King". Both of their initial personalities match, being full of confidence and arrogance.
