 Summary 
 In the dungeon,  Pegasus  gives  Kaiba  five  Star Chips  and makes a deal with him. If he can beat  Yugi , then he may  Duel  Pegasus to rescue  Mokuba 's spirit. Meanwhile, Yugi and the group emerge from the underground tunnel and arrive outside  Pegasus Castle .  Téa  thinks about how Yugi often switches from a gentle and caring nature to a more forceful, slightly colder and unfriendlier one. She concludes there must be two Yugis after remembering his  Duel with Bakura . She recalls how she first became friends with  Joey  and Yugi. She was working at  Burgerpalooza  despite being too young and she feared that Yugi and Joey would give her real age away one time when they visited. She admitted she was working there to raise money to study ballet dancing and was shocked to find they encouraged her instead of mocking her. At a later point, she was lured into a warehouse by a  mugger . She was rescued by  Yami Yugi  who challenged the mugger to Duel Monsters and  Mind Crushed  him.
 
       Kaiba  and  Yugi  prepare to face off.     
 In present day, the gang approach the castle door, but it is blocked by Kaiba, who challenges Yugi to a Duel. After Kaiba insists his attitude has changed, Yugi accepts. They Duel on an open area atop the castle using Kaiba's new-and-improved  Duel Disks .  Bandit Keith  arrives at the castle in time to watch, but he stays out of view of the others. The Duel is pretty close. Each player is brought down to 1500  Life Points , but Kaiba has a plan to  fuse  all three of his " Blue-Eyes White Dragons " to form the mighty " Blue-Eyes Ultimate Dragon ".
 
 
 Featured Duel: Yami Yugi vs. Seto Kaiba 
 
 This Duel uses  Duelist Kingdom  gameplay. Rules and  card effects  may differ from that of the  TCG / OCG . See the individual card articles for more information.     
 Turn 1: Kaiba 
 Kaiba   Normal Summons  " Ryu-Kishin Powered " (1600/1200) in  Attack Position . His  hand  contains " Battle Ox ", " Saggi the Dark Clown ", " Ancient Lamp ", and " Blue-Eyes White Dragon ".
 Turn 2: Yami Yugi 
 Yugi  Normal Summons " Curse of Dragon " (2000/1500) in Attack Position. "Curse of Dragon"  attacks  and  destroys  "Ryu-Kishin Powered" (Kaiba: 2000 → 1600  LP ). Yugi's  hand  contains " Multiply ", " Monster Replace ", " Dark Magician ", and " The Eye of Truth ".
 Turn 3: Kaiba 
Kaiba  draws  " Swordstalker " and subsequently Normal Summons it (2000/1600) in Attack Position. Since a monster was  destroyed by battle  during the previous  turn , "Swordstalker" gains  ATK  equal to 20% of its  original ATK  ("Swordstalker": 2000 → 2400/1600). "Swordstalker" attacks "Curse of Dragon", but Yugi  activates  " Monster Replace " to return "Curse of Dragon" to his hand and  Special Summon  "Dark Magician" (2500/2100) in Attack Position. Since "Swordstalker's" original  attack target  has  left the field , the attack is  negated .
 Turn 4: Yami Yugi 
"Dark Magician" attacks and destroys "Swordstalker" (Kaiba: 1600 → 1500 LP). Yugi then Normal Summons "Curse of Dragon" (2000/1500) in Attack Position.
 Turn 5: Kaiba 
Kaiba draws " La Jinn the Mystical Genie of the Lamp " and subsequently Normal Summons it (1800/1000) in Attack Position.
 Turn 6: Yami Yugi 
"Dark Magician" attacks "La Jinn", but Kaiba activates "Ancient Lamp" to redirect the attack to "Curse of Dragon", destroying it instead (Yugi: 2000 → 1500 LP).
 Duel continues in the next episode . 
 
 Trivia 
 The Hulu and Netflix prints have Fox's TV-Y7-FV rating, long after Fox stopped airing children's programming. After the show ended its run on Kids' WB!, reruns moved to Fox's 4KidsTV, where the network's rating was plastered on several episodes. The CW4Kids and later Vortexx used these prints as well.
 
 Differences in adaptations 
       The original Japanese version (left) and the English version with the video camera edited out (right).     
 In the Japanese version, Burgerpalooza is called Burger World. 
 In the English version, Téa wasn't supposed to be working at Burgerpalooza because the restaurant employees had to be at least 18. In the Japanese version, it was because part-time jobs were against school rules. 
 In the English version, a note in Téa's locker claimed there was a dance studio in a warehouse, with a picture of ballet shoes on the other side of the note. In the Japanese version, the note contained a photo of Téa working at Burger World and threatened to give her "secret job" away if she didn't turn up to the gymnasium. 
 In the English version, Téa was assaulted by a mugger. In the Japanese version, she was videotaped by a pervert.
 Because of these changes, scenes that show the man using his video camera as well as the view of the camera from a first person view are removed. 
 Cut from the dub was a shot of the pervert videotaping Téa's skirt. 
 In the original Japanese version, the episode goes to commercial after the closeup on Yugi and Kaiba. In the dub, the scene where Kaiba says he can't let Yugi pass is shown immediately after the closeup. 
 In the original Japanese version, no one speaks after Yugi accepts Kaiba's challenge. Also, the exterior of the Castle is removed from the dub. 
 The original Japanese version has Saruwatari simply allowing Keith into the castle instead of telling him about the duel on the roof that's about to start. 
 The Japanese version specifies that, having seen Pegasus Duel, Kaiba suspects that Pegasus has a way to reading the identities of his opponent's cards. His Duel Disk transforms cards in the players' hands into hologram forms, and Kaiba hopes that this technology will prevent Pegasus from reading his cards. However, Yugi doesn't think that they'll help Kaiba defend against the Millennium Eye, especially in a Shadow Game. All this was removed from the dub. 
 In the dub, the skirt Téa wears at Burger World is lengthened. 
 
 
 Errors 
 In the dub, when Kaiba Summons "Ryu-Kishin Powered", he calls it " Ryu-Kishin ".
