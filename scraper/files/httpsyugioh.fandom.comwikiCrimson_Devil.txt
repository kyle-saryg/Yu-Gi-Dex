 Red Nova , known as  Scar-Red Nova  (sometimes translated as  Scarlet Nova ) in the Japanese version, is the  Crimson Devil  and the strongest of the  Earthbound Immortals . It is known to be a mercilessly brutal demon, to the extent that even the  Dark Signers  did not dare attempt to harness its power.
 
 Biography 
 In its true form, it single-handedly fought against the  Crimson Dragon  5,000 years before the other  Earthbound Immortals  and lost.
 
       The Crimson Devil      The Crimson Devil has a fire demon servant, the  Familiar of Red Nova , who planned to offer the body of  Jack Atlas  as a vessel, to awaken the Crimson Devil from its 10,000-year slumber. It is said to be associated with the serpent  Nazca Line .
 10,000 years ago, Red Nova drove the Crimson Dragon to its limits and was only stopped by a legendary  Signer  who possessed a  Blazing Soul .
 Towards the end of the ritual  Duel  between the Demon's servant and  Jack Atlas , Red Nova was  summoned  by his servant to take Jack. However, the Crimson Dragon appeared, helping Jack acquire the necessary power through Blazing Soul to capture Red Nova and seal it into " Red Dragon Archfiend ", giving it the ability to evolve into " Red Nova Dragon ".
 
 Trivia 
 At the time of the release of the material involving Red Nova, the Serpent Nazca Line was fictional, but in 2014, a sandstorm uncovered a real Snake Line. [1] 
 At the time of its introduction, Red Nova was the second largest monster seen in the anime; behind  the Great Leviathan , though both have since been surpassed. 
 Due to complications involved with dubbing the episodes, the story of Red Nova was skipped; as a result, in the English Dub, Jack summoning  Red Nova Dragon  (its tamed form) in the finals of the WRGP was a surprise to his teammates.
