 Biography 
 The street fighter played the  Virtual VS  arcade game with  Yugi , where both of them choose the same character,  Bruce Ryu . After Yugi defeated him several times, the street fighter beat up Yugi in retaliation and took his  Millennium Puzzle .  Jonouchi  found out what happened afterwards and chased down the street fighter to get back the Puzzle. [2] 
 The street fighter set up a fighting game where, if Jonouchi won, he could take back the Puzzle. Both players fought with a knife clenched between their teeth. He threaten to smash the Puzzle if Jonouchi refused. The street fighter cheated as he secretly had a trick knife that was capable of sliding into its hilt. That proved irrelevant as Jonouchi told him to take the knife out of his mouth, so he won't have to hold back from punching him in the face. He accepted and Jonouchi kept a knife in his own mouth. [2] 
 Jonouchi teased the street fighter's speed while he dodged all his punches with his hands in his pockets. The street fighter got annoyed and told him to take his hands out of his pockets. Jonouchi left them in saying he had promises to his friend in both pockets and he didn't get to see them until the end of the game. When the street fighter got close to Jonouchi, Jonouchi popped open a can of soda from one pocket, spraying the street fighter in the face and irritating his eyes as a useful distraction. The soda was a promise he had made to Yugi. Jonouchi then punches him using his fist from his other pocket, saying that that was his promise to clobber him. Jonouchi returned the Puzzle to Yugi afterwards. [2]

 Trivia 
 Much like the  Air Muscle  and  Junky Scorpion  arc, this character's actions alludes to real life stories about the less savory sides of the video game arcade scene in Japan, where sometimes more aggressive and overly competitive challengers would beat up the competing champion player outside of the game; one such story can be heard from Daigo Umehara of the real life professional  Street Fighter  video game tournament e-sport scene, where he had such an experience in middle school like Yugi Mutou.  [3]
