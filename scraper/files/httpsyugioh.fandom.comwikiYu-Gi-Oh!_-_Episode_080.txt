 Differences in adaptations 
 The dub cuts a shot of  Yugi  and his friends walking down the street. 
 The dub removes " Cyber Harpie 's" breast spikes. 
 The dub cuts a scene showing  Joey  telling  Mai Valentine  to stop wasting time and to think about the finals. She says she knows! Then he tells her to keep fighting with their support. 
 The dub cuts a scene showing  Serenity  reminding her brother that he just said he was a big fan of  Magnum 's, and he says that was five minutes ago. 
 The dub removes the scene of  Joey Wheeler  kicking the car. 
 In the American version, Jean Claude talks more during the duel. 
 Errors 
 When Yugi mentions " Harpie's Feather Duster " in the dub, he says that it cancels out the effects of all  Magic Cards .  The card does not negate, but destroys, all Spell and  Trap Cards  the opponent controls. 
 When Magnum was explaining the effect of " Ninja Smoke Ball ", he had three cards in his hand when he should only have two. 
 After Joey saves Mai by catching her and Magnum offers to help her up, causing her to slap away his hand, her detached sleeve is missing upon slapping him, but returns in the next scene.
