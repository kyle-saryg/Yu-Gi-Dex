 Biography 
 History 
 Sledgehammer was due to Duel the current Champion,  Yusho Sakaki , but Yusho never showed up, much to his fury. [1] 
 
 Pre-Arc League Championship 
 Sledgehammer promoted the  Leo Institute of Dueling  in its commercial. Sledgehammer's manager,  Nico Smiley , arranged an  Action Duel  between Sledgehammer and Yusho's son,  Yuya Sakaki . As the announcements for the Duel begin, Yuya appeared to be nowhere to be found, causing Sledgehammer and many of the crowd to think that Yuya was as cowardly as his father. Yuya then showed up behind him, dressed as a harlequin, forcing the audience to point out Sledgehammer's challenger to him. Sledgehammer was displeased with Yuya's attitude, thinking that he was being disrespectful, and allowed Yuya to take the first  turn  in the Duel. Yuya immediately Summoned and began to ride away on " Performapal Hip Hippo ," much to Sledgehammer's displeasure as he remained on one of the towers of " Castle of Chaos ." Sledgehammer brought out his ace monster on his first turn, " Battleguard King ," but Yuya swiftly used  Action Cards  to dodge and endure the repeated  attacks . Yuya then proceeded to call out his own ace card, " Odd-Eyes Dragon ", and used Action Cards that he'd spotted while running around the arena to  pay  for the  cost  of his " Wonder Balloons ", something Sledgehammer picked up on. Yuya attempted a  One-Turn Kill , but Sledgehammer used his own Action Card to prevent the damage, and in his next turn, reduced Yuya to 400  Life Points  and restored his own. He appeared to have the match won, but then Yuya performed a  Pendulum Summon  and Summoned three monsters at once. [1]  Sledgehammer was shocked that it could have happened, but Nico Smiley pointed out that Yuya's  Duel Disk  had accepted it, so there was no error. Yuya then proceeded to wipe out all of Sledgehammer's Life Points by supporting his " Odd-Eyes Pendulum Dragon " with his other monsters, knocking Sledgehammer backwards. [2] 
 After his loss, he chose to step down as champion and went overseas to train. [3] 
 
 Duel Academy 
 After  Z-ARC 's defeat and the  Standard Dimension  being reborn into the  "Pendulum Dimension" , Sledgehammer is seen watching  Yuya 's Duel against  Jack Atlas . [4]  He applauded when Yuya won and watched Yuya and  Declan 's  Action Duel . [5]  He was happy when Yuya won the Duel and witnessed  Zuzu Boyle 's revival. [6] 
 
 Deck 
 Sledgehammer plays a  " Battleguard " Deck , mainly focused on  Summoning  his  ace   monster , " Battleguard King ". He supports it with cards such as " Battleguard Howling " and " Battleguard Rage " which he combines with " Battleguard Magic " to replenish his  Life Points .

 Trivia 
 Unlike the first opponents of previous series where they eventually become either frenemies or close allies to the main protagonist, The Sledgehammer never appears again after his loss to Yuya.
 The same can also be said for  Yu-Gi-Oh! VRAINS , as  Yusaku 's first opponent of the series was a low leveled member of the  Knights of Hanoi .
