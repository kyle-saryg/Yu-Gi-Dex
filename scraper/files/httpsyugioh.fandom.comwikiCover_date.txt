 Wikipedia  has an article about  Cover date . 
 
 
 The  cover date  of a magazine is the date displayed on the cover. This is not always the date the magazine was published.
 V Jump , for example, is published on the twenty-first of every month. The cover date is always two months later than the actual release date - an issue released in January 2011 will have a cover date of March 2011.
