 Although this card offers the choice of more targets, you should consider using " Dark Eruption " instead of this card if you want to avoid taking  damage  to your  Life Points . Most of the better targets for this card have 1500 ATK or less anyway, and using it on one of the cards which cannot be used with Dark Eruption would result in the loss of a large amount of LP.
 Also remember that this card cannot target any " Blackwing " monster with 0 ATK. 
 After activating this card, follow it up with " Black Feather Beacon " to Special Summon the monster you added back, if it can be Special Summoned. 
 " Guard Penguin ", which shares type with the " Blackwings ", can be Special Summoned in response to the damage you take.
