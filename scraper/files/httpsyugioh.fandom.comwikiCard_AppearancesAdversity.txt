 In  episode 34 ,  Shay Obsidian  plays this card in his  Action Duel  against  Sora Perse . When Sora attacks " Raidraptor - Rise Falcon " with his " Frightfur Leo ", Shay activates this card. Since "Rise Falcon" has less  ATK  than "Leo", this card protects "Rise Falcon" from destruction, reduces all battle damage to 0, and increases the ATK of "Rise Falcon" by 1000 ("Rise Falcon" 100 â†’ 1100).
