 An  Equip Spell Card , known as an  Equip Magic Card  (Japanese:  装 備 魔 法 カード  Sōbi Mahō Kādo ) in the  OCG , is a  Spell Card  that is a card that is  equipped  to a  face-up   monster  on the  field . Equip Spell Cards are a type of  Equip Card ; Equip Cards can also be  Trap Cards  or monsters that are treated as Equip Cards.
 When you activate an Equip Spell Card, you must  target  a face-up monster on the field to equip the card to; the Equip Spell Card's effect applies to that monster as long as it is equipped. Equip Cards constantly  target  the monster they are equipped to; even while  negated , Equip Cards remain equipped and continue to target the monster. If the equipped monster is no longer face-up on the field, or is no longer a valid target, the Equip Card is immediately  destroyed .
 Unless specified, Equip Cards can be equipped to monsters  controlled  by either player, and  changing control  of a monster does not cause control of an Equip Card to change. While the equipped monster can be the opponent's, the Equip Card's  controller  is the one referred to "you" in the Equip Card's  card text , not the controller of the equipped monster. 
 
 Examples 
 An  ATK -boosting Equip Spell Card is " Axe of Despair ". 
 A  DEF -boosting Equip Spell Card is " Horn of Light ". 
 Some Equip Spell Cards revive a monster from the  Graveyard  and equip to that monster, such as " Premature Burial " and " Re-Fusion ". In this case, they target the monster while it is in the Graveyard. 
 Some Equip Spell Cards change control of the equipped monster, such as " Falling Down " and " Snatch Steal ". 
 Equip Spell Cards can grant other effects, such as piercing (" Big Bang Shot "), the ability to attack twice (" Twin Swords of Flashing Light - Tryce ") or the ability to attack an opponent directly (" Opti-Camouflage Armor "). 
 Some Equip Spell Cards with a negative effect are " Mask of Brutality " and " Darkworld Shackles ".
