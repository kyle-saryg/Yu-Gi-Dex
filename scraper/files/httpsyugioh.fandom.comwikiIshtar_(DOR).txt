 Ishtar  is the  Yu-Gi-Oh! The Duelists of the Roses  incarnation of  Ishizu Ishtar . She is a member of the White Roses and is located at  Isle of Man .
 After the player defeats  Pegasus Crawford , they face Ishtar. After beating her all the previous paths converge and Bosworth appears in the middle of the map, where  Richard Slysheen  is located.
 The player can obtain the card " Jowls of Dark Demise ", using the  find  ability on D4, while playing against Ishtar.
 
 Deck 
 Ishtar uses a Water Deck. Many of her monsters have 1500 or lower  ATK , allowing them to cross  Crush  terrains. To compensate for their low ATK, she can strengthen most of them through the  Umi  terrain and a number of power-ups and halve the ATK of all her opponent's monsters with " Mirror Wall ". The strongest monster she can Summon is " Crab Turtle ", through the  Ritual  " Turtle Oath ".
