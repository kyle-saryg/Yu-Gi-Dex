 " Trap Hole ", known as " Pitfall " ( 落 とし 穴   Otoshiana ) in the  OCG , is an  archetype  of  Trap Cards  having "Trap Hole" in their names. These cards are counterparts of the original " Trap Hole ". With the exception of " Adhesion Trap Hole " and “ Floodgate Trap Hole ”, "Trap Hole" cards have  effects  that  destroy  1 or more  monsters  under certain conditions. This archetype is "anti-supported" by " Goblin Pothole Squad " and supported by the " Traptrix " archetype.
 Although they are related to the " Hole " archetype through the "Traptrix", they are a separate group of cards. Since all support for the "Hole" archetype also supports the "Trap Hole" archetype, in the  TCG , the "Trap Hole" archetype is treated as a subset of the "Hole" archetype.
 " Darkfall " (formerly known as "Dark Trap Hole") is not a member of this archetype since its Japanese name does not contain 「落とし穴」 (its Japanese name contains 「落とし 大 穴」, with the kanji 「大」 interrupting 「落とし穴」). " Chaos Trap Hole " and " Gemini Trap Hole " are " Hole " cards but not "Trap Hole" cards, since their Japanese names contain 「ホール」  Hole  but not 「落とし穴」  Pitfall .
