 The Battle for the Duel Zodiacs!! 
 
 " Determination...!! ", known as " Resolution...!! " in the Japanese version, is the thirty-fourth chapter of the  Yu-Gi-Oh! 5D's  manga . 
 This chapter was first printed May 21, 2012 in the 7/2012 issue of the  V-Jump  magazine. It was later reprinted in  volume 5  of the  tankōbon .
 After the  Duel  between  Kalin  and  Jack  concludes, more is revealed about their past. Meanwhile, as the  D1GP  goes on, both the  Skeleton Knight  and  Rex Goodwin 's plans start to surface.
 
 Summary 
 After  Kalin  is defeated, the  Duel Dragon 's miasma leaves him, and enters  Jack 's mind, showing the truth about Kalin's past. After Jack's victory, he was sent to  New Domino City  to become the "King". Kalin smiled, happy about his friend. However, he later discovers the truth behind  Rex Goodwin 's plans, and causes an explosion in order to save his friends in  V.S.S.L. .
 The miasma then vanishes and Jack is back in reality. Kalin offers Jack his " Void Ogre Dragon ", but Jack refuses it. However, Jack recognizes Kalin's strength, and tells Kalin that Dueling him was the only diversion he had at the Facility.
 Meanwhile,  Yusei  is at the 8th  Duel Zodiac , when his " Stardust Spark Dragon " appears - the  Skeleton Knight  appeared before him. He shows him  Sect 's goggles, and tells Yusei about his current state and what's going to happen to him. Skeleton Knight also reveals to Yusei that Sect is currently awaiting in the  Aerial Fortress Seibal , a giant fortress, which Yusei notices floating in the sky and that it will be the place for the "ritual". Then, Skeleton Knight vanishes.
 At that moment, Rex Goodwin is seen watching all  D1GP  contestants, while his plans for reviving the " Ultimate God " slowly start to surface.
