 Summary 
 An expedition in an unknown ocean deploys a submarine to enter what appears to be a submerged city. Amongst the team on this expedition is  Professor Hawkins , amazed at the discovery.
 
       The robed man  challenges  Weevil  and  Rex  to a  Duel .     
 Some time after the Battle City tournament, both  Weevil Underwood  and  Rex Raptor  run into each other. Having obviously heard of the  Egyptian God Cards , they plan on getting their hands on them no matter what, oblivious to the fact that they couldn't use them anyway. While running down a hill street, they crash upon an enigmatic monk-like figure, who recognizes them. Things turn worse when the man announces that he has come to take their souls and commands them to Duel with him, displaying a never-before-seen model of  Duel Disk .
 The same afternoon, Yami Yugi rushes out of the high school building to try to open the door to his World of Memories.  Joey ,  Tristan  and  Téa  catch up with him, and they promise to remain friends. At the same time, elsewhere, a hooded man inside of an enigmatic temple is chanting a spell in an unknown language. (The language is never specified, but it sounds like Ancient Greek). 
 Yami and the others face the " Tablet of Lost Memories ", and as Yami presents the God Cards, the  Millennium Puzzle  on the tablet responds. Meanwhile, the mysterious man chants in a quicker manner, and the echo of his voice can be heard inside of the museum as the tablet is covered in ice.
 A shriek rings out in the street, and the group rushes out to see Duel Monsters swarming everywhere. They decide to try to consult Kaiba Corporation. While rushing there, they stumble upon both Weevil and Rex, who look strange and are muttering strange things like "it has begun... there's the sign..." and "soon this world shall swallowed by the  great beast ... "
 
       Roland  swamped by reporters.     
 The group rushes into the KC building, which is swarmed with reporters and operators trying to handle all of the incoming calls.  Kaiba's  secretary and Battle City Referee, Roland, is nervously telling the media that they don't know why is this happening. He announces that the President of KaibaCorp will hold a press conference soon from the United States, before forcing the reporters outside.
 Later that evening, Yami and the others are watching TV in Yugi's house.  Solomon Muto  is polishing the God Cards in the meantime. The TV reports more incidents of Duel Monsters appearing around the world. Yami wonders if trying to open the World of Memories provoked this. Seto Kaiba suddenly comes into view, making the appointed press conference. He claims that the root of the problem isn't within KaibaCorp, since they disabled the Duel Monster visualization system and the Duel Monsters continued to show up.
 The group wonders what both Weevil and Rex were babbling about earlier when a sound comes from downstairs. Yugi rushes down there to find Solomon on the ground and the shop ransacked. Solomon tells Yugi that someone stole the God Cards.
 
       The  Egyptian God  cards materialize in the city.     
 Rushing outside, the group see the 3 Gods materializing in different parts of city. Yugi wonders who could be doing this, as one would need one of the  Millennium Items  to be able to Summon them. Suddenly, three bikes come into view and three persons riding on them display the same type of Duel Disk the monk sported. They each make a different announcement about themselves and their mysterious organization.
 Yugi and Joey demand to know if they stole the God Cards. The second man picks " Obelisk " from his Duel Disk and hold it up. He admits to the theft and claims to know about the  Nameless Pharaoh . They then challenge him to come to a building currently under construction if they want to retrieve the God Cards, and run off towards it.
 The group reach the topmost floor, and are greeted by the same monk who faced Weevil and Rex. His name is Gurimo, and he claims to serve Rafael before he politely challenges Yami to a Duel. The 3 Swordsmen look on from a higher spot; it appears they set this up so as to test Yami's strength.  The tallest among them  states that if Yami Yugi falls here, then he isn't their enemy. The others add that they still needs the "souls" of both Joey and Kaiba. The blond man claims that by gathering their "souls", their scheme shall be completed.
 Gurimo engages a strange  Field Spell Card : " The Seal of Orichalcos ". Yami Yugi thinks this is a " Shadow Game ", and tries to use his  Millennium Puzzle , which fails to deter the Seal. Gurimo claims that the Millennium Items are powerless inside of this area. Gurimo's monsters become "dark" and gain 500  ATK  each. Yami Yugi manages to gain the upper hand by Summoning " Valkyrion the Magna Warrior ", but Gurimo suddenly Summons "Obelisk the Tormentor" to Yami's shock. Apparently, this power allows him to control one of the Gods without the need of the  Millennium Items .
 
 Featured Duel: Yami Yugi vs. Gurimo 
 Turn 1: Yami Yugi 
Yami Yugi draws " Beta The Magnet Warrior " and subsequently Normal Summons it (1700/1600) in  Defense Position . He then  Sets  a card.
 Turn 2: Gurimo 
Gurimo draws. He then  Normal Summons  " Marauding Captain " (1200/400) in  Attack Position . Since "Marauding Captain" was Normal Summoned, its effect activates, allowing Gurimo to  Special Summon  " Shadow Tamer " (800/700) in  Attack Position . Gurimo then activates " The Seal of Orichalcos ". Now all of Gurimo's monsters will gain 500  ATK  and the loser of the Duel will lose his soul ("Marauding Captain" 1200 → 1700/400) ("Shadow Tamer" 800 → 1300/700). 
 "Marauding Captain" attacks and destroys "Beta The Magnet Warrior".  Yami Yugi  then activates his face-down " Soul Rope " to pay 1000 Life Points (Yugi 4000 → 3000) and  Special Summon  " Gamma The Magnet Warrior " (1500/1800) in  Defense Position . [Notes 1]  Gurimo's hand contains " Makyura the Destructor ", " Hidden Soldiers ", and " Obelisk the Tormentor ". Gurimo then  Sets  a card.
 Turn 3: Yami Yugi 
Yami Yugi draws " Alpha The Magnet Warrior " and subsequently Normal Summons it (1400/1700) in  Attack Position . Gurimo activates his face-down "Hidden Soldiers" to  Special Summon  "Makyura the Destructor" (1600 → 2100/1200) from his hand in  Attack Position  as Yami Yugi Normal Summoned a monster. 
 Yami Yugi then  activates  " The Shallow Grave " to allow both players to  Special Summon  a monster from their  Graveyard  in  Defense Position . Yami Yugi Special Summons "Beta The Magnet Warrior" (1700/1600) in Defense Position while Gurimo doesn't Special Summon anything due to his  Graveyard  being currently empty. [Notes 2] 
 Yami Yugi then  Tributes  "Alpha The Magnet Warrior", "Beta The Magnet Warrior", and "Gamma The Magnet Warrior" in order to  Special Summon  " Valkyrion the Magna Warrior " (3500/3850) in  Attack Position . "Valkyrion the Magna Warrior"  attacks  and  destroys  "Marauding Captain" (Gurimo 4000 → 2200).
 Turn 4: Gurimo 
Gurimo draws " Monster Reborn " and subsequently activates it to  Special Summon  "Marauding Captain" (1200 → 1700/400) from the  Graveyard  in  Attack Position . Gurimo then  Tributes  "Makyura the Destructor", "Shadow Tamer", and "Marauding Captain" in order to  Tribute Summon  " Obelisk the Tormentor " (4000 → 4500/4000) in  Attack Position .
 Duel concludes next episode. 
 
 Notes 
 
 ↑   In the OCG/TCG, " Soul Rope " cannot be  activated  during the  Damage Step . 
 
 ↑   In the  OCG / TCG , both players must have at least 1  monster  in their Graveyard if " The Shallow Grave " is activated. 
 
 
 Differences in adaptations 
 The Japanese episode begins with a newscast, which is digitized out of the dub. It shows shots of a couple passing by a store window full of televisions showing the newscast, then Weevil Underwood and Rex Raptor passing by. 
 When  Téa  is looking on the roof of Domino High, a shot of her at a fence is cut from the dub. 
 " Shadow Tamer " has been given more clothing to wear in the dub. 
 Cut from the English version is a sequence of  Tristan ,  Joey , and  Téa  coming back to watch the Duel, clutching their various bruises.  Joey  says that Yugi's opponent has changed since the "Seal" was activated, and  Tristan  says his monsters have become "Dark Monsters".  Téa  sounds concerned after hearing  Gurimo  proclaim that the loser's soul will be sealed. Afterward, they are blown back by the energy of " the Seal ". 
 When  Gurimo  activates " The Seal of Orichalcos ", he mentions that its effect turns all monsters on his side of the field "dark" (evil). (Note: This is unrelated to the  DARK   Attribute .) This mention is absent in the dub. 
 Errors 
 Repeatedly throughout the episode, the clothing of "Shadow Tamer" changes back and forth from her original to the edited version. This is particularly noticeable just before she's tributed, where her outfit is that of her Japanese artwork, though moments before then it was the edited version. 
 Trivia 
 This episode marks the debut of the card's design to be seen using the Series 3 layout (not counting the opening  WARRIORS  which the cards can be seen prior to the Series 3 cards to be used in the series). 
 Though Sam Regiel, the original voice of Rex Raptor, was still under 4kids employ as Donatello in the 2003 adaptation of Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, Rex's voice actor was changed for this arc with Sebastian Arcelus. 
 Starting with this episode, the end of the credits of every English-dubbed episode of this series, as well as its spin-offs, contain the words, "Yu-Gi-Oh! and all related characters are trademarks of Shueisha, inc."
