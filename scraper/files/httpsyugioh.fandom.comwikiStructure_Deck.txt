 A  Structure Deck  (Japanese: ストラクチャーデッキ  Sutorakuchā Dekki ) is a retailed pre-made  Deck  designed to be playable straight from the box without any modification needed. It is similar to a  Starter Deck , but is focused on a certain  Type ,  Attribute ,  Archetype , strategy, or  Yu-Gi-Oh!  character.
 
 Content Patterns 
 The older Decks always included at least one single new card, printed as an  Ultra Rare ; after the  Curse of Darkness Structure Deck , they always introduce 5 new cards, 1 or 2 of them being Ultra Rare, 2 of them  Super Rares , and the remaining 2 as  Commons  (usually  Spells  or  Traps ). In addition to specific contents, there might be some splashable included in these decks.
 After a Structure Deck is released, the  Booster Packs  that follow it typically include cards that support the Structure Deck's themes. Another popular way to power up a structure deck is to buy multiple copies of a single Structure Deck, usually 3, and combine the Deck's best cards into one.
 
 Difference from Starter Decks 
 See also:  Starter Deck 
 As opposed to  Starter Decks  (with the exception of  Duelist Toolbox ,  V for Victory ,  Space-Time Showdown , and  Yuya ), Structure Decks may include multiple copies of the same card. This is because Structure Decks are designed with a focused strategy in mind, unlike Starter Decks, which are made to learn how to play. The  playmat  included also features the cover monster in the background somewhat blocking the visibility of the card zones.
 
 Structure Deck R 
 Main article:  Structure Deck R 
 A certain older Structure Deck may be reworked into  Structure Deck R , which resemble the original deck, but with new cards introduced so that the deck will work in the current era.
