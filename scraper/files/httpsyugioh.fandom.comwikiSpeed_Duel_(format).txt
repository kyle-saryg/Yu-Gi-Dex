 Speed Duel  (スピードデュエル  Supīdo Dyueru ) is a beginner format that was used in  Yu-Gi-Oh! Official Card Game . It is easy to experience and recommended for players to remember the basics on how to play the game. This concept was first introduced in the " Duel Terminal " system under a different  ruling system . It was later used as the main gameplay of  Yu-Gi-Oh! Duel Monsters Saikyo Card Battle  and  Yu-Gi-Oh! Duel Links . There is a format exclusive to the  Yu-Gi-Oh! VRAINS  anime, for a Duel taking place in the  Data Storm  in  LINK VRAINS . [1] [2] 
 The Booster Packs tend to use the names of episodes from the anime.

 Rules 
 
 4000  LP 
 4 cards in the starting  hand 
 20 to 30 cards in the  Main Deck 
 6 cards in the  Extra Deck 
 2  Extra Monster Zones 
 Each player has 3  Main Monster Zones , 3  Spell & Trap Zones , and 1  Field Zone .
 The available Monster and Spell & Trap Zones are those in the second to fourth column. 
 Therefore, the  Pendulum Zones  are not present.
 In  Yu-Gi-Oh! Duel Links , the left and right Spell & Trap Zones act as Pendulum Zones.  However, certain  Skills  can create separate Pendulum Zones, similar to  Master Rules 3 . 
 Like a normal  Duel , the first player doesn't  draw  on their first turn, the  hand size limit  is 6, both players can have an active  Field Spell Card  and there can only be 3 cards with the same name in both the Main Deck and the Extra Deck. 
 Skills  are also created in Speed Duel Only. 
 How to play 
 Follow the Normal Duel's gameplay. 
 There is  no   Main Phase 2 . 
 Anime 
         Speed Duels feature a smaller playing field than Master Duels     
 In the  Yu-Gi-Oh! VRAINS  anime, the Speed Duel is a common-used format.
 Speed Duels were legendary Duels played in  LINK VRAINS  where players use  D-Boards  to ride the  Data Storm . This kind of Duel had disappeared for many years when the Data Storm apparently ceased to exist, making Speed Duels be only known as rumors. However, when  Yusaku Fujiki  captured  Ai , the latter released the Data Storm, thus reviving these Duels. [2]
