 Summary 
 After a grueling battle,  Reiji  reveals his true schemes, surprising  Isaac  with his intellect and concluding the battle in an outer space environment.
 
 Featured Duel: Reiji Akaba vs. Isaac 
 Duel continues from the previous Scale . 
 Turn 6: Isaac 
(Isaac's Deck: 30 → 29)  Isaac   Pendulum Summons  " Mirror Imagine Catadioptricker 7 " (0/0) and " Mirror Imagine Prism Coat 8 " (0/2600). He  activates  the former's  effect ,  adding  the three " Additional Mirror Level 7 " from his  Graveyard  to his  hand , which he subsequently activates,  Special Summoning  two additional "Prism Coat 8" (0/2600 each). Isaac activates the effect of his three "Prism Coat 8"; each of them, when  Tributed , increases the  ATK  of "Catadioptricker 7" by half the ATK of an opponent's monster, with Isaac choosing " D/D/D/D Super-Dimensional Sovereign Emperor Zero Paradox ", and grant "Catadioptricker 7" an additional effect. The first "Prism Coat 8" makes "Catadioptricker 7" unaffected by non-" Mirror Imagine " monsters' effects ("Catadioptricker 7": 0 → 1500 ATK). The second one makes it unaffected by opponent's  Spell Cards  ("Catadioptricker 7": 1500 → 3000 ATK). The third one makes it unaffected by opponent's  Trap Cards  ("Catadioptricker 7": 3000 → 4500 ATK).
 "Catadioptricker 7"  attacks  "Zero Paradox", but Reiji activates his  face-down  " Zero Gravitation ", making him able to choose the  targets  for Isaac's attacks. Reiji tries to redirect the attack to his " D/D/D Supersight King Zero Maxwell ", but Isaac activates his face-down " Mirror World Break ",  banishing  "Zero Maxwell". The attack continues towards "Zero Paradox", but Reiji activates its effect, making him able to use the effect of a card in Isaac's  Pendulum Zone . He activates the effect of " Mirror Imagine Secondary 9 ", allowing him to Special Summon a "Mirror Imagine" monster from his Deck and making it the new attack target. The second effect of "Zero Gravitation" treats both player's  Decks  as a single Deck for the  turn  - making Reiji able to Special Summon " Mirror Imagine Reflector 1 " from the united Decks and redirecting the attack to it (Isaac's Deck: 29 → 28).
 Reiji activates the effect of "Reflector 1", Tributing it to  negate  the effects of "Catadioptricker 7" and decrease its ATK by 1000 ("Catadioptricker 7": 4500 → 3500 ATK), as well as Special Summoning " Mirror Imagine Reflector 2 " and redirecting the attack to it (Isaac's Deck: 28 → 27). The effect of "Reflector 2" also activates, with Reiji Tributing it to halve the ATK of "Catadioptricker 7" ("Catadioptricker 7": 3500 → 1750 ATK), as well as Special Summoning " Mirror Imagine Reflector 3 " and redirecting the attack to it (Isaac's Deck: 27 → 26). Finally, Reiji activates the effect of "Reflector 3", Tributing it to redirect the attack to his "Zero Paradox". Reiji also activates the effect of "Zero Paradox"; once, during a turn where a " D/D/D " monster left the  field , the ATK of "Zero Paradox" can be doubled ("Zero Paradox": 3000 → 6000 ATK). "Catadioptricker 7" attacks "Zero Paradox", getting itself  destroyed  (Isaac: 4000 → 0 LP).
