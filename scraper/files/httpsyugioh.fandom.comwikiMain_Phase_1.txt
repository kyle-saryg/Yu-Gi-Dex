       Order of a  turn .     
 Main Phase 1  (Japanese: メインフェイズ１  Mein Feizu Ichi ) is a  Main Phase  conducted after the  Standby Phase . As a Main Phase, most actions that could normally be performed in  Main Phase 2  can also be performed in this phase.
 After Main Phase 1 has ended, the turn player may choose to enter the  Battle Phase . If they choose not to, the player automatically proceeds to the  End Phase  (they cannot enter  Main Phase 2  unless they conduct their Battle Phase).
 Some cards and effects can only be activated during Main Phase 1, such as " Cold Wave " and the effect of " Dark Strike Fighter ". Many of these effects possess this restriction due to applying an effect during the Battle Phase, such as " After the Struggle " and the effect of " Baby Tiragon ".
 
 Possible actions 
 In Main Phase 1, the  turn player  may:
 
 Normal Summon / Set  a monster (the player can only perform one Normal Summon/Set per turn, so the player cannot Normal Summon/Set in both Main Phases). 
 Special Summon  a monster(s). 
 Manually change the  battle position  of a monster, provided that monster was not  Summoned  or  Set  during that same turn, and it had not already manually changed its battle position that turn. 
 Flip Summon  a  monster , provided it was not  Summoned  or  Set  during that same turn. 
 Activate  Ignition Effects , such as those of " Barrel Dragon " or " Cannon Soldier ". 
 Set   Spell / Trap Cards . 
 Activate Spell/Trap Cards of any  Spell Speed .  Quick-Play Spell Cards  and  Trap Cards  cannot be activated in the turn they are  Set .
