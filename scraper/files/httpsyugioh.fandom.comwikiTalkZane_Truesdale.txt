 Steam Gyroid 
 For those deleting Steam Gyroid; Zane DOES HAVE A COPY OF IT! WATCH  Yu-Gi-Oh! GX - Episode 020 - The Maiden in Love  FOR PROOF! IT'S WHEN ZANE'S DECK IS DROPPED AND BLAIR & JADEN IS RUNNING!
 Thank you.
 
 it didn't really show it and besides you put it in the underworld deck. 
 It is actually there. -- Dragon   Slayer  ( Contribs   •   Count ) 23:22, 19 February 2008 (UTC)
 Close examination shows that the card shown is  Cyber Twin Dragon . -- Dragon   Slayer  ( Contribs   •   Count ) 23:25, 19 February 2008 (UTC)
 No it's there alright,   --  Deltaneos  11:38, 20 February 2008 (UTC) 
 This looks like the 4Kids edit, and they're known for screwing up the cards.  Shot from the original?  Danny Lilithborne  20:38, 21 February 2008 (UTC)
 
 Actually, I'd say it's from the original, given Monster Reborn has its OCG image. Though, admittedly, I haven't confirmed it by watching the episode (either version.)  —This unsigned comment was made by  203.143.249.41  ( talk  •  contribs ) 17:46, 19 February 2009 (UTC) 
 It is the 4Kids version. You can tell by the card layouts. ie. There's no text on them and the artwork takes up most of the card. --  Deltaneos  ( talk ) 17:57, 19 February 2009 (UTC) 
 In the original it looks like a trap card, not a fusion 
 (-- Guilsperm  22:37, 31 May 2009 (UTC))Yo! Zane don't have Steam-Gyroid. I am a fanatic and trust me he wouldnt be caught dead using "Roid" cards. And Syrus didn't surpass Zane in season 4 adding Roids to the Underworld deck is terrible and doesn't work in real life. I have a copy of Zane's Underworld deck and it works great! Of course i had to get rid of 2 Cyber Dragons and then cyber laser and i replaced them with 2 masked dragons, a second exploder dragon, and machine king proto-type.
 
 Look at the image above...we know he never  used  it, but that was his deck that spilled. PS.  Dragonroid  and the other roids were added to Zane's deck in season 4.  Dmaster  ( Talk   •   Contribs   •   Count ) 23:31, 31 May 2009 (UTC) 
 (-- Guilsperm  18:37, 1 June 2009 (UTC)) yeah Syrus added it cause he's a duech.
 I've just watched the Japanese version of this episode and when you See the cards near Zane's foot none of them look like Steam Gyroid, they looked more like Trap cards rather than fusions, so I think this is just one of the many mistakes done by 4Kids. -- Trivi-AM  19:19, 1 June 2009 (UTC)
 
 164 
 The roids aren't Zane's cards, Syrus mixed cards from his and Zanes deck together to make a new one, atleast thats what I got out of the episode, I could be wrong  Joeshoes  21:05, 6 December 2007 (UTC)
 
 Yes, the title of Episode #164 is 「受け継がれしサイバー・ダーク・ドラゴン」, or, "The Inherited Cyber Dark Dragon." And, as you can see in the episode even if you don't speak Japanese, Shou has mixed the 'Underworld' Deck of his brother with his Vehicroid Deck to make his own Cyber-Style Deck. So, this should really be moved to Shou's Deck.  209.151.140.173  04:22, 11 December 2007 (UTC) 
 Mess Up 
 Zane Truesdale  doesn't have 3  Proto-Cyber Dragons  or 2  Thunder Dragons  also  Zane  never uses 2  Cyberdark Dragons  or 2  Cyber End Dragons  he also does not use  Lost Pride   Syrus  does.
 
 Zane uses  Lost Pride   against principal sheppard at the dojo.  Dmaster  15:31, 11 February 2008 (UTC) 
 Cybernetic Fusion Support 
 They need to switch Cybernetic Fusion Support with Ruthless Denial i cannot recall a time when zane used Cybernetic Fusion Support after the Underground Duel
 
 actually he does use it to pull out cyber end but the poor thing gets destroyed by Mad Dog's card effect that gives him life points equal to the monsters attack points and then destroyes it. (-- Guilsperm  00:45, 29 May 2009 (UTC)) 
 Re: Cybernetic Fusion Support 
 Actually he did also use it in the Graduation Duel against Jaden. 24.188.53.20  13:54, 14 June 2008 (UTC)
 	
I wanted to know whether the benefit of inotsume Makoto zane, zane pq active when the trap that I think q is samsara, the Makoto has a face of scared.
 
 Evil -> Good 
 According to this article, in season 2 he is cold and ruthless and goes as far as deliberately hurting his own brother just for fun. In season 3 he saves jaden and helps defeat the supreme king and becomes all good all of the sudden. Any explanation for the change?
 Oh yeah and in season 2 he betrays cyber dragon, but in season 3 he uses it as a symbol for his skill? WTF?
 
 He still valued victory overall and went about it in a ruthless way. He isn't exactly evil or good, I think what he is, is called and Anti-Hero. PS. I honestly think his symbol should have been the Cyberdark Dragon/Cyber End Dragon combo.  Dmaster  ( Talk   •   Contribs   •   Count ) 06:16, 29 July 2009 (UTC) 
 "aka Dark Zane." 
 Isn't that name utter fanon? He was never called that in the dub, ever. They didn't change "Hell Kaiser" to "Dark Zane", they simply omitted the nicknames altogether. Shouldn't the section header be changed? Granted, since there was no name change in the dub, it's hard to come up with a header name that encompasses both versions.  Cheesedude  01:03, November 27, 2009 (UTC)
 
 "Dark Zane" was used as Zane's name after he "changed" to his "darker" self in the english version of various YGO video games.  D.Kaiser  ( Talk   •   Contribs   •   Count ) 17:36, November 27, 2009 (UTC) 
 Lost in translation 
 In the episode where he gives his deck to Syrus it is stated that he gives him the Cyber-Style Reverse Legacy (Underworld deck) that doesnt include the original Cyber-Style Lagacy(Cyber Dragon, Cyber End Dragon,...).
That is a great mistake becaust the two decks didnt melt into one (even if Zane used it that way).
 
 Beaten Jaden 
 Hey, do any of you guys know who defeated Jaden besides Zane & Kaibaman?-Legendlink
 
 Go to the  Jaden Yuki's Decks  page and it will list the record or wins and losses. To access these pages, go to the characters pages and go to the decks section.  D.Kaiser  06:19, April 10, 2010 (UTC) 
 Thanks 4 the info, but I suddenly remembered it's Aster Phoenix. Thanks anyway!-Legendlink

 isnt his 
 affilition duel academy like everyone else
and his occupation has to be professional duelist Sartorias  12:38, June 13, 2010 (UTC)
 
 Thank you for pointing that out. I had "affiliation" listed in the infobox, but had forgotten to add the equals sign, so the it didn't show up. I've fixed that and added occupation as well.  Cheesedude  18:31, June 13, 2010 (UTC)

 Would Hell Kaiser Ryo be not so different but at the same time a contrast to Bandit Keith? 
 They fell from grace after losing to a powerful opponent that sunk them into depression until they gain a new persona whose tactics define their personality via dirty means while at the same time they utilize Machine monsters. Unlike Keith, Ryo learned how to control his darkness to the point that allowed him to rise while Keith didn't. Keith cheats while Ryo disrespect his cards only to respect later on. Would you agree?
