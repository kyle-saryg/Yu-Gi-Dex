 Paradise City , known as  Maiami City  or  Miami City [1] [2]  ( 舞網 市   Maiami-shi ) in the Japanese anime version. In the manga, this city is known as  Maiami City  ( ＭＡＩＡＭＩ 市   Maiami-shi ). This is a city set on the coast of Japan, where the central events of the first two arcs of  Yu-Gi-Oh! ARC-V  anime take place. The development of the city's technology is focused on  Dueling . The headquarters of the  Leo Corporation  is located here, along with preparatory Duel schools such as the  You Show Duel School  and  Leo Institute of Dueling . [3] 
Paradise City is the home to the Leo Corporation's  ARC System  that gave birth to  Action Duels , which started here and is now popular across the world. [3]   Yuto  later reveals that Paradise City is located in the  Standard Dimension , a dimension of unknown origins where  Ritual ,  Fusion ,  Synchro , and  Xyz Summoning  all exist, as well as where the  Pendulum Summon  originated.

 Trivia 
 The city's name in the Japanese version is a pun on  Miami , a famous U.S city in the real world.
 In the English version, the name Paradise - given later events in the anime - may suggest a reference to Milton's  Paradise Lost .
