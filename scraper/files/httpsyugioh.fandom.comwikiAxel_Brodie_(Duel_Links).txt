 Trivia 
 Axel's Summoning Pose is similar to the pose he had in the Japanese  Yu-Gi-Oh! GX  intro song " Precious Time, Glory Days ". 
 Initially, Axel Brodie did not have a 3D cutscene for " Volcanic Doomfire ". But as of December 5, 2020, the cutscene for "Volcanic Doomfire" has been made available when summoned by Axel Brodie. 
 The inclusion of " The Blazing Mars  as card-specific dialogue comes from Axel's use of that card in  chapter 58  of the  Yu-Gi-Oh! GX  manga. 
 The inclusion of " Dancing Fairy " and " Maiden of the Aqua " as card-specific dialogue references how the card spirit counterparts of the said cards were allied with Axel in the  Duel Monsters Spirit World . 
 The inclusion of " Metalsilver Armor " as card-specific dialogue references how Axel, Aster, and Zane donned the said armor to infiltrate  The Supreme King's castle  in  episode 142  of the  Yu-Gi-Oh! GX  anime. 
 The card " Volcanic Wall " is a Spell Card, but the text and voice line in the game erroneously list it as a Trap Card.
