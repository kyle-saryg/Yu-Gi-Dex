 Starlight Rare  is a  rarity  in the  Yu-Gi-Oh! Trading Card Game . It debuted in  Rising Rampage .
 Starlight Rare cards have the same horizontal holographic foil pattern as a  Prismatic Secret Rare , but applied to the whole card rather than only the artwork, similar to the  Platinum Secret Rare . The only areas of the card to which the foil is not applied are the card text box, empty  Link Arrows , and portions of the artwork. In idea, this seems to replace  Ultimate Rare , which is now used exclusively in  OTS Tournament Packs .
 The existence of this rarity was not mentioned until after the physical release of its debut set,  Rising Rampage , and did not receive an official database designation until  Dawn of Majesty . It has appeared in every core series  Booster Pack  since Rising Rampage, where it appears as an alternative rarity for four cards that are also available in a standard rarity in that set. The cards are selected so that there is one of each original rarity:  Rare ,  Super Rare ,  Ultra Rare , and  Secret Rare  (2 as of  Eternity Code  since Rare has been retired from standard boosters).
