 Name 
 Wouldn't  Kite  be the accurate translation of his name? A similar confusion arose with Light from Death Note being known as  Raito  for a while. >:/-- RexGodwin  ( talk  •  contribs ) 09:13, June 1, 2011 (UTC)

 I keep undoing your edits because you are not an authority on it.  If someone such as Cheesedude decides that the information shouldn't be on the page, they will remove it.  Until then, please leave it there.  -- Taylor Gorrell  ( talk  •  contribs ) 18:45, June 15, 2011 (UTC)
 
 I have no more authority than anyone else even if I'm an admin. If the info is true, it should stay. If it's not, remove it. I myself don't know if it is, as I've not found a translation for  Yu-Gi-Oh! ZEXAL - Rank SP1 . However, I have no reason to believe the info presented is false.

 Pause Time 
 Isn't that just Orbital 7's ability? (So he doesn't have that ability as well)  - Falzar FZ - ( talk page | useful stuff )  02:15, July 6, 2011 (UTC)
 
 Until I read Orbital 7's article, I thought it was Kaito's power. Perhaps I just wasn't paying attention, but I didn't see any indication that it was Orbital 7 that paused time.  Cheesedude  ( talk  •  contribs ) 03:13, July 6, 2011 (UTC) 
 Subs are already up. It is Orbital 7. Nevermind then.  Cheesedude  ( talk  •  contribs ) 03:35, July 6, 2011 (UTC) 
 reading strange language 
 where does it say that kaito can read the same language that astral is able to read?  LastMinute  ( talk  •  contribs ) 04:25, July 17, 2011 (UTC)
 
 Victims 
 Rather than just putting a list of Kaito's victims, wouldn't it be better an article about Photon Hand's victims like the article about Trueman's victims. The guy that had Number 16 is also a victim of the Photon hand and should be added somewhere.  —This unsigned comment was made by  201.192.44.110  ( talk  •  contribs ) 14:33, August 13, 2011 
 Thanks for bring this one up, but please, if you're rely on Forum or Talk page, like here, be sure to sign your edits with four tildes before you hit the button to end the edit box, ok? I put your missing name to prevent you from being known as vandalism. -- F r e d C a t  14:46, August 13, 2011 (UTC)
 I did't know how to put a sign, I don't know much about wikis or computers at all, so thanks for that.  201.192.44.110  ( talk ) 20:19, August 14, 2011 (UTC) 
 English name 
 on toonzai's website, his name is confirmed as kite and his little brother as Haru(im not sure about his name) but Im certain that his English name is Kite  —This unsigned comment was made by  96.246.5.231  ( talk  •  contribs ) 16:46, October 9, 2011 
 
 Where exactly did you see this information? I don't see it anywhere on Toonzai.  86.15.144.198  ( talk ) 17:41, October 9, 2011 (UTC) 
 It was on the website before with every main character and some character from episode 1-6 but they took it off this week. If not then just ignored this.  —This unsigned comment was made by  Demolisty  ( talk  •  contribs ) 00:28, October 11, 2011 
 Actually on wikipedia his name has been confirmed as Kaito Tenma.  Darth Rishda  ( talk  •  contribs ) 21:02, December 8, 2011 (UTC) 
 Wikipedia isn't reliable source. -- 77.46.251.106  ( talk ) 21:10, December 8, 2011 (UTC) 
 "Kite" and "Kaito" are both valid transliterations of "カイト". See " Kiteroid " for example. So Kite might be his Japanese version name too. Or is the name ever spelled out in Latin characters as "Kaito" in the Japanese version? --  Deltaneos  ( talk ) 03:29, March 6, 2012 (UTC)
 
 Right. Same for "Haruto" and "Hart", I believe. But yes, it was rendered in Latin characters as "Kaito" in all episodes where he Dueled.  Cheesedude  ( talk  •  contribs ) 03:39, March 6, 2012 (UTC) 
 The Japanese word and name Kaito means "master thief". This could probably refer to the fact that he steals the souls of other people. I also think the Yugioh makers choose the name because it is some kind of pun on the name Seto Kaiba caus the Japanese people say the last name first so it's KAIba seTO. The english name could refer to Orbital 7s glider form  91.20.235.216  ( talk ) 16:04, March 16, 2012 (UTC) 
 His Japanese name was definitely "Kaito". To see this, check out  Card Gallery:Number 10: Illumiknight . One of the images there (I don't know how to put it here) shows a screenshot from an OCG commercial for Photon Shockwave where it shows Number 10 and 20 with a picture of Kaito with his name in English as "Kaito".  TeeWhyGeeOh  ( talk  •  contribs ) 06:13, March 17, 2012 (UTC)
 I think his name should be spelled "Kyte" because who would have a name spelled like a childhood toy?  —This unsigned comment was made by  174.63.74.180  ( talk  •  contribs ) 13:00, March 18, 2012 
 
 It's not child toy, it's for all age and it is hobby. But I think "Kyte" suit this dude better than "Kite". It's just little silly for this tough guy like him to have cute name, he need a tough name to match that. -- F r e d C a t  13:36, March 18, 2012 (UTC) 
 He has a jetpack that resembles a kite right? so...  - Falzar FZ - ( talk page | useful stuff )  13:52, March 18, 2012 (UTC) 
 Heh, I never noticed that Orbital 7 was kite-shaped in jetpack mode.  Cheesedude  ( talk  •  contribs ) 18:55, March 18, 2012 (UTC) 
 This one ... guess it's not really a jet pack. The jet pack is the other one that appears in  Yu-Gi-Oh! ZEXAL - Episode 036 .  - Falzar FZ - ( talk page | useful stuff )  12:39, March 19, 2012 (UTC)
 That's all metal wings of bird, I see no "Kite" style. Are you sure there is one that resemble the kite? -- F r e d C a t  12:43, March 19, 2012 (UTC) 
 There are kites that look like that. Foil and Bow kites.  - Falzar FZ - ( talk page | useful stuff )  01:39, March 20, 2012 (UTC)
 Must be new to me, I only saw diamond-shape and Triangle-shape in my life, but never those "bow" and shoot. -- F r e d C a t  01:43, March 20, 2012 (UTC) 
 English voice 
 Is confirmed that Marc Thompson is the voice of Kite? It just seems a little odd to me. I'm not saying that it couldn't be, but it just seems strange that he would be voicing two such major characters in the series.  TeeWhyGeeOh  ( talk  •  contribs ) 03:48, March 7, 2012 (UTC)
 
 Victims 
 ...Is that really important? In my opinion that doesn't add anything to the article.  LegenaryAsariUgetsu  ( talk  •  contribs ) 21:57, May 18, 2012 (UTC)
 
 Yeah, we could probably remove that. When his episodes first aired, it seemed like something really important, but they never revisited it.  Cheesedude  ( talk  •  contribs ) 22:10, May 18, 2012 (UTC) 
 Make note of this? 
 Should we make note of Kite being the only main rival in the anime thus far to have not lost against the main male protagonist at least once or not. Kaiba, Chazz, and Jack before Kite have all lost against the main male protagonist at least once, but Kite has yet to be defeated by Yuma as of now(the first duel ended with no result, the second Duel ended in a Tie, and the third Duel ended with Kite defeating Yuma). This is only for now as it's unknown if Yuma will every battle or possibly defeat Kite in  Yu-Gi-Oh! ZEXAL II . Cardsknower  ( talk  •  contribs ) 04:28, September 26, 2012 (UTC)Cardsknower
 
 Judai never beat Hell Kaiser.-- RexGodwin  ( talk  •  contribs ) 23:08, December 12, 2012 (UTC)
 He didn't counted "Kaiser" yet... Following first antagonist of each show have lost to Yugi/Judai/Yusei so far. -- i F r e d C a t  23:16, December 12, 2012 (UTC) 
 No he meant rival. Kaiba, and arguably Jack in the beginning were villains, but Manjoume was simply an elitist rival. And so, no Kaito is not unique in this regard. Kaiser has had the exact same track record with Judai: Win, Draw and no conclusion.-- RexGodwin  ( talk  •  contribs ) 00:07, December 13, 2012 (UTC) 
 He said "main rival". Kaiser was a rival, not the main rival. That has to be Manjoume. Regardless, I don't see any reason to note this, especially because it's very likely Kaito will lose to Yuma by the series' end.  Cheesedude  ( talk  •  contribs ) 02:30, December 13, 2012 (UTC) 
 Well in that case Shark is Yumas main rival.-- RexGodwin  ( talk  •  contribs ) 02:58, December 13, 2012 (UTC) 
 Cl...utt...er... 
 Holy  hell  the character articles are cluttered, would you mind terribly if I go through and make some stylistic changes? I put this here first because it's probably minor but it'd be a page overhaul and might not even be worth it, in which case I wouldn't want to go through the effort.  It'd be like going from what you have at the beginning now to something like:
 
 Kite Tenjo , known as  Kaito Tenjo  in the manga, is one of the main characters in  Yu-Gi-Oh! ZEXAL . Having been told by  Dr. Faker  that  Hart Tenjo 's illness was due to the  Number holders  and the  Astral World , Kite became a  Number Hunter  in order to cure him. He is accompanied by  Orbital 7 . 
 While formerly a rival to  Yuma Tsukumo  and  Astral  in gathering the " Numbers ", he became friends with them after his brother was cured. 
 ...Where the removed information is mentioned further down in the page.  Adreus  ( talk  •  contribs ) 15:57, June 10, 2013 (UTC)
 Let me guess
Im tyring to look up the full episode to see if Kite was revived by the Numeron Code as well since my friend was devastated to hear he died and im only seeing info on the Barian emperors. SO did he? my friend would be so happy. (Im happy they brought back Shark. He was my fav!!) Roxasofmalice  ( talk  •  contribs ) 13:08, March 23, 2014 (UTC)
 
 Yeah, he was brought back too.  Shardsilver  ( talk  •  contribs ) 13:14, March 23, 2014 (UTC) 
 Age 
 can i add that he turned 19 in the middle of the series since he was 18 at the start so its possible for him to turned 19( Saeryukgkj  ( talk  •  contribs ) 11:32, July 11, 2015 (UTC))
 
 No. We don't know how long (in-universe) the ZEXAL events took place. Leave it.  ChaosGallade  ( talk  •  contribs ) 11:52, July 11, 2015 (UTC)
