 Summary 
 (NOTE: for steps in the   Yugi  vs.  Yami Bakura  Duel please see the  Featured Duel  section below) 
 
 The Arrival of Zorc Necrophades 
 Back at  Kul Elna , the sand in the  Dark RPG 's Sandglass for the Revival of the Evil God:  Zorc  has been resurrected.
 Thief King Bakura  and " Diabound " merge into the Table of the Realm of the Dead: the stone is shattered, scattering the  Millennium Items  all around. Zorc finally appears. 
 Zorc starts showcasing his power and wreaking destruction upon the land.  Hassan 's protection does not last, and he is rapidly overrun. The remaining  Priests  flee back to the capital.
 While they flee,  Isis 's " Spiria " keeps an eye out for Zorc's progress. 
 Back in the desert,  Priest Seto  and the  Pharaoh  leave  Kisara  and  Seto Kaiba  behind, and set off for the Egyptian capital too.
 As they arrive, they find the other  Priests  have already been preparing the capital city for battle.
 Suddenly, the  Pharaoh  seems to be fainting. He's too weak to lead this battle, so he leaves command of the armies to  Priest Seto . 
 Priest Seto  orders the Pharaoh's  ballistae  and catapults to attack, but they disintegrate before they reach  Zorc .
 Zorc counter-attacks and wipes out part of the Pharaoh's troops.  Priest Seto  orders them to retreat to the Royal Palace. 
 The Past Affecting the Present 
 Suddenly back in the 'Territory of the Gods' at the  Dark RPG  table,  Yami Yugi  sees visions of modern times all around him. It is being destroyed. 
 Yami Yugi :  " This is...?! " 
 Yami Bakura :  " It'd seem that the world of the Dark Game and the real world have begun to link together! " 
 Yami Yugi :  " What do you mean!? " 
 Yami Bakura :  " It deserves the name of 'Ultimate Dark Game'! It's going even beyond my expectations, but I don't mind. Having discovered your true name, the 8th key, I was planning on resurrecting Zorc within the  real  world. But this'll spare me some unnecessary efforts! Both worlds are now interconnected! And everyone will be buried into the darkness! * evil laugh * " 
 Yami Yugi (thinking):  " I've got to seal Zorc again no matter what! " 
 Shada's Sacrifice 
 The  Priests  Summon their  Ka  to protect the city:
 Mana  Summons " Dark Magician Girl ": it attacks with  Magic Wave . 
 Isis  Summons " Spiria ". 
 Shada  Summons " Two-Headed Jackal Warrior ". 
 Priest Seto  Summons " Duos ": it attacks with  Aura Force .
 None of the attacks phase  Zorc . His counter-attack however is ruthless. And it is targeted straight at the  Pharaoh !
 Shada  jumps in front to protect his King. He is struck down and loses all of his BA. thus dying in battle. 
 Featured Duel: Yugi Muto vs. Yami Bakura 
 Yami Bakura  explains the rules of the Duel:
 
 Each person has 40 cards in his deck. 
 The Deck's cards become according to the Duelist's imagination. In other words, each player has no idea about what cards constitute his Deck until he draws them. 
 This is a  Shadow Game : the loser must sacrifice his life. 
 If Yugi wins, Bakura will return  Tristan 's body and allow Yugi & his friends to leave. 
 Turn 1: Yugi 
(Yugi's Deck: 40 → 35)
Yugi draws a card and subsequently sets it (Yugi's Deck: 35 → 34). He then sets a monster.
 Turn 2: Bakura 
Yami Bakura draws. He then Normal Summons " Doomcaliber Knight " (1900/1800) in Attack Position. "Doomcaliber Knight" attacks Yugi's Set monster. It is flipped face-up and revealed to be " Marshmallon " (300/500). Since "Marshmallon" was flipped face-up, its first effect activates, inflicting 1000 damage to Yami Bakura ( Bakura  4000 → 3000). Due to the second effect of "Marshmallon", it isn't destroyed. Yami Bakura Sets a card. 
 Turn 3: Yugi 
Yugi draws a card and subsequently sets it (Yugi's Deck: 34 → 33). He then Normal Summons " Silent Swordsman LV0 " (1000/1000) in  Attack Position . Yugi then activates his face-down " Marshmallon Glasses ". Now as long as "Marshmallon Glasses" and " Marshmallon " remain face-up on Yugi's side of the Field, Yami Bakura can only attack "Marshmallon".
 Turn 4: Bakura 
Yami Bakura draws "Call of the Earthbound". He then activates " Negate Defense " to switch "Marshmallon" to  Attack Position  and forbid Yugi from changing its battle position. "Doomcaliber Knight" attacks Yugi's "Marshmallon". Due to the second effect of "Marshmallon", it is not destroyed ( Yugi  4000 → 2400). Yami Bakura then Sets a Card.
 Turn 5: Yugi 
Yugi draws (Yugi's Deck: 33 → 32). On Yugi's Standby Phase, the effect of "Silent Swordsman LV0" activates, increasing its LV by one and increasing its ATK by 500 ("Silent Swordsman LV0" → Silent Swordsman LV1: 1000 → 1500/1000). Yami Bakura activates his face-down " Call of the Earthbound " and  chains  his face-down " Zoma the Spirit " to its activation. The two cards resolve in reverse order. First "Zoma the Spirit" is  Special Summoned  as an  Effect Monster  (1800/500) on Bakura's side of the field in  Defense Position . Next "Call of the Earthbound" forces Yugi's Silent Swordsman to attack Bakura's "Zoma the Spirit". 
 Silent Swordsman then destroys "Zoma the Spirit". The effect of "Zoma the Spirit" activates, which will inflict damage to Yugi equal to double the  ATK  of the Monster that destroyed it, but Yugi activates " Turn Jump " to skip right over this turn's  Battle Phase  and negate the effect of "Zoma the Spirit" as well as move the  turn count  forward by three ("Silent Swordsman LV1" → "Silent Swordsman LV4": 1500 → 3000/1000).
 Silent Swordsman LV4 attacks & destroys Yami Bakura's "Doomcaliber Knight" ( Bakura  3000 → 1900). "Marshmallon" attacks directly ( Bakura  1900 → 1600).
