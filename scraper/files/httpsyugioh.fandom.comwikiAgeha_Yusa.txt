 Appearance 
       Full body of Ageha Yusa     
 Ageha is a young girl with pink eyes and long, spiky turquoise hair that comes down to her lower back, some of it covering her left eyebrow and a mole under her left eye. She will sweep that hair up when she gets serious in a duel. Her outfit consists of triangular silver earrings, a long-sleeved, skin-tight red sweater with exposed shoulders, a dark gray studded belt with a double-X-carved silver buckle, black pantyhose, and pink heeled ankle boots tied by dark gray straps whose ends hang out. Her Duel Disk is a manga KC mass production model with a customized pink color.
 
 Personality 
 Ageha loves dueling but as an adult, she has to miss many tournaments and events due to work. She is confident when dueling, especially after going through the qualifiers and becoming a World Championships representative.

 Biography 
 History 
 Ageha and her brother lived in the countryside. One day she received a job in Tokyo and offered him to come along. After settling in, Ageha enters Shoma's room to see if he unpacked only to find him gone. She isn't surprised as she correctly guesses that he left to go to the card shop. After learning that Shoma is late coming home, Ageha vows to give him the mother of all lectures when he returns. The next day Ageha attempts to speak to her brother but finds him unresponsive. She guesses that he's already in Structure World communicating with his deck.
