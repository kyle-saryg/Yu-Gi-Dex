 "Dweller in the Dark!!" , known as  "Dweller of the Deep Darkness!!  in the Japanese version, is the eighth chapter of the  Yu-Gi-Oh! R  manga. It was first printed in Japan on November 21, 2004 in  V Jump  magazine. It was later reprinted in volume 1 of Yu-Gi-Oh! R.
 In the next block,  Yugi  is confronted by  Maico Kato , the next  card professor .
 
 Featured Duel: Dark Yugi vs. Maico Kato 
 Turn 1: Yugi 
 Dark Yugi  draws. He then  Normal Summons  " Big Shield Gardna " (100/2600) in  Defense Position .
 Turn 2: Maico 
 Maico  draws. She then Normal Summons " Leprechaun " (400/200) in  Attack Position . She  equips  it with " Poison Crossbow ". Whenever it  attacks , Maico will take no  Battle Damage  and the battled  monster  will be  destroyed . "Leprechaun" attacks "Big Shield Gardna", destroying it via the  effect  of "Poison Crossbow". Maico  Sets  a card.
 Turn 3: Yugi 
Yugi draws. He then Sets two cards and Normal Summons " Jack's Knight " (1800/1200) in Attack Position. "Jack's Knight' attacks "Leprechaun", but Maico  activates  her  face-down   Field Magic Card : " Deep Forest ",  negating  the attack. [Notes 1] 
 Turn 4: Maico 
Maico draws. She then Sets a card. "Leprechaun" attacks "Jack's Knight", destroying it via the effect of "Poison Crossbow". Yugi activates his face-down " Spellbinding Illusion ", decreasing the  ATK  of "Leprechaun" by 500 ("Leprechaun": 400 → 0/200).
 Turn 5: Yugi 
Yugi draws. He then Normal Summons " Gazelle the King of Mythical Beasts " (1500/1200) in Attack Position. "Gazelle" attacks and destroys "Leprechaun" (Maico 4000 → 2500), with "Deep Forest" unable to negate the attack due to "Spellbinding Illusion". Since a  Beast - Type  monster controlled by Maico was destroyed this turn, Maico  pays  1000  Life Points  (Maico 2500 → 1500) to  Special Summon  " Green Baboon, Defender of the Forest " (2600/1800) from her  hand  in Attack Position.
 Turn 6: Maico 
Maico draws. She then activates " Chameleon Colors " and  equips  it to "Green Baboon", enabling it to attack  directly  when there is a face-up Field Magic Card. "Green Baboon" attacks directly (Yugi 4000 → 1400).
 Turn 7: Yugi 
Yugi draws "Archfiend of Gilfer". He then  Tributes  "Gazelle" to Normal Summon " Archfiend of Gilfer " (2200/2500) in Attack Position. Yugi activates " Flames of the Archfiend ", which would destroy "Deep Forest" as he  controls  a  Fiend - Type  monster, but Maico activates her face-down " De-Spell ", which would negate and destroy "Flames of the Archfiend". However, Yugi activates his own "De-Spell", negating and destroying Maico's "De-Spell". "Deep Forest" is destroyed. The next effect of "Flames of the Archfiend" deals 1000  damage  to both players (Yugi 1400 → 400, Maico 1500 → 500) and decreases the ATK of "Green Baboon" of 1000 ("Green Baboon": 2600 → 1600/1800). "Archfiend of Gilfer" attacks and destroys "Green Baboon" (Maico 500 → 0).
