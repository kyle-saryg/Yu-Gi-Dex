 Plot and Counterplot?! 
 
 "The Light of Hope!!"  is the fourth chapter of the  Yu-Gi-Oh! ZEXAL  manga .
 This chapter was first printed in the 5/2011 issue of  V Jump , released on March 21, 2011. It was later reprinted in the  volume 1  of  Yu-Gi-Oh! ZEXAL .
 Yuma   draws  " Monster Reborn " and decides to counterattack  Shark ; however, Yuma accidentally makes a misplay.  Astral  says that Yuma is pathetic, but that his feelings are strong, and that they will win if Yuma trusts him. Suddenly, a black card is revealed in Yuma's  Extra Deck .
 
 Featured Duel: Yuma Tsukumo vs. Ryoga "Shark" Kamishiro 
 Duel continues from  the previous Rank .
 Turn 7: Yuma 
Yuma  Normal Summons  " Ganbara Knight " (0/1800), and  activates  " Monster Reborn ",  Special Summoning  " Gagaga Magician " (1500/1000) from his  Graveyard . He  overlays  both  monsters  to  Xyz Summon  " No. 39: Utopia " (2500/2000) in  Attack Position . "Utopia"  attacks  and  destroys  " Drill Barnacle " (Shark 3700 → 2500). 
 Turn 8: Shark 
Shark activates " Surface ", Special Summoning " Big Jaws " (1800/300) from his Graveyard. He  Tributes  it to Summon " Jawsman " (2600/1200). "Jawsman" gains 300  ATK  for each  WATER  monster he  controls  (2600 → 2900). " No. 17: Leviathan Dragon " attacks "Utopia", but Yuma activates the  effect  of "Utopia",  negating  the attack by  detaching  the  overlaid  "Ganbara Knight". "Jawsman" attacks "Utopia", but Yuma activates his  face-down  " Bye Bye Damage ", inflicting  damage  to Shark equal to double the amount of  Battle Damage  Yuma took (Yuma 500 → 100, Shark 2500 → 1700). 
 Turn 9: Yuma 
Yuma attacks "Leviathan Dragon" with "Utopia", with Yuma negating his own attack by detaching the overlaid "Gagaga Magician" with the effect of "Utopia". He then activates the  Quick-Play Spell Card  " Double Up Chance ", letting "Utopia" attack again, with its ATK doubled (2500 → 5000). It does so (Shark 1700 → 0).
