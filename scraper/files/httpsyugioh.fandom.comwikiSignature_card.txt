 Signature card
 
 
 
 
 
 
 A  signature card  or "Ace card" is a card most associated with a  Duelist , and tends to be used in a majority of their  Duels , as their most favorite card. Signature cards tend to be  Monster Cards .
 Duelists may have more than one signature card, and there generally are connections between the card and the duelist.
 In some cases, signature cards are created by their owner(s) and/or only one copy of them exist in the anime like " Elemental HERO Neos " and the " Numbers ".
 In  Yu-Gi-Oh! 5D's ,  Yu-Gi-Oh! ZEXAL  and  Yu-Gi-Oh! VRAINS , they tend to be  Synchro Monsters ,  Xyz Monsters  and  Link Monsters , respectively. Signature Monster Cards may also be called  Ace Monsters .
 Some video games have a similar concept known as a  Key Card , in which the player selects a certain card as their "ace".  Yu-Gi-Oh! The Duelists of the Roses  has "Deck Leaders".
