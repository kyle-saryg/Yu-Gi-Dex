 " Behind You ", known in Japan as " A Horrifying Horror Duel " is the tenth episode of the  Yu-Gi-Oh! SEVENS  anime. It aired in Japan on August 8, 2020.
 Yuga   and   co.  got tickets to a  RoaRomin  concert from  Romin . They arrived at a place called the "Seven Hells Hall". Yuga was then challenged by  Roa , the vocalist Duelist of RoaRomin, to a 3 v. 3 match, with the ownership of Rush Dueling at stake. Luke will have to face off against the  first Duelist  in a nightmare-inducing Horror Duel!
 
 Featured Duel: Lucidien "Luke" Kallister vs. Ushiro Omaeno 
 The Duel is conducted as a  Rush Duel .
 Turn 1: Ushiro Ushiro  Normal Summons " Hanako's Right Behind You " (0/800), " Witching Hour Chrysanthemum Doll " (0/200) and " Spirit Dwelling in the Purple Mirror " (0/300). Ushiro activates " Cursed Fan Letter " to switch all Attack Position  Zombie  monsters he controls with 0 ATK to Defense Position. After that happens, Luke must send cards from his hand to the GY equal to the number of face-up Defense Position Zombie monsters he controls, as well as take 300 damage for every card sent to the GY this way. There are three Defense Position monsters, so Luke sends " Dragon's Setupper ", " Justice Dragon " and " Piercing! " (Luke: 4000 → 3100 LP). Ushiro Sets a card.
 Turn 2: Luke Since Luke has two cards in his hand, he draws three cards. Since Luke drew a card(s), Ushiro activates his face-down " Gradually Approaching Footsteps " to look at Luke's hand, choose up to three Spells/Traps among them, Set them to the field and inflict 300 damage to Luke for each one. Three are Set (Luke: 3100 → 2200 LP).
 Turn 3: Ushiro Since Ushiro has no cards in his hand, he draws five cards. Ushiro activates " Dry Knock Sound " to choose up to 2 Spell/Trap Cards Luke controls and destroy them, but Ushiro cannot attack the turn this card is activated. Ushiro then Tributes "Witching Hour Chrysanthemum Doll" and "Spirit Dwelling in the Purple Mirror" to Tribute Summon " Wicked Shadow - Dark Rooker " (100/2600). Ushiro then activates the effect of "Dark Rooker" to send the top card of his Deck to the Graveyard, destroy Luke's remaining face-down card, inflict 1000 damage to Luke and return itself to his hand (Luke: 2200 → 1200). Ushiro Sets two cards.
 Turn 4: Luke Since Luke has two cards in his hand, he draws three cards. Since Luke drew a card(s), Ushiro activates his face-down " Cursed Call Number " to 300 damage to Luke for every card he drew (Luke: 1200 → 300 LP). Since Luke took effect damage, Ushiro activates his face-down " Behind You! " to Special Summon a Zombie monster from his hand with its ATK and DEF swapped. He Special Summons "Dark Rooker" (100 → 2600/2600 → 100) in Attack Position. Luke Normal Summons " Dragon's Upsetter " (1000/0). Since he controls no other monsters, Luke uses the effect of "Dragon's Upsetter" to Special Summon "Dragon's Setupper" (0/1000) from his GY in Defense Position, but Luke cannot attack with Level 6 or lower monsters this turn. Luke Normal Summons " Phoenix Dragon " (500/500). He then activates its effect to send " Fire Dragon's Heatflash " from his hand to the GY and add 1 Level 5 or higher Dragon-Type monster from his Deck to his hand. He adds " Justice Dragon ".
 Luke Tributes "Dragon's Setupper" and "Dragon's Upsetter" to Tribute Summon " Rush Dragon Dragears " (2500/1500). Luke Tributes "Phoenix Dragon" to Tribute Summon "Justice Dragon" (1200/1200). He then activates its effect to shuffle "Phoenix Dragon" and "Dragon's Upsetter" from his Graveyard into his Deck and treat itself as two Tributes for the Tribute Summon of a Dragon-Type monster. Luke then Tributes "Justice Dragon" to Tribute Summon " Shocklead Dragon " (1600/2500). Luke then activates the effect of "Shocklead Dragon" to send the top card of his Deck to the Graveyard and reduce the ATK of the strongest monster Ushiro controls by the ATK of the strongest monster Luke controls ("Dark Rooker": 2600 → 100/100), however "Shocklead Dragon" can only attack Attack Position monsters this turn. Luke activates the effect of "Dragears" to send the top card of his Deck to the Graveyard and allow it to attack again if it destroys a monster by battle. "Dragears" attacks and destroys "Hanako's Right Behind You". "Shocklead Dragon" attacks and destroys "Dark Rooker" (Ushiro: 4000 → 2500 LP). "Dragears" attacks directly (Ushiro: 2500 → 0 LP).
