 Summary 
 Alexis ' " Blizzard Princess " and the " Ice Doll " copying its  effect  both  attack , with Alexis revealing that the effect of "Blizzard Princess" will  negate  all of the opponent's  Spell  and  Trap Cards .  Adrian 's " Forbidden Beast Bronn " and " Forbidden Beast Dharmjul " are  destroyed  and his and  Jesse's   Life Points  drop to 0.  Dr. Crowler  announces Alexis and  Bastion  as the winners, as  Jaden  and  Syrus  cheer. Jesse says that with an  ace  like "Blizzard Princess", he was unable to use the power of his  face-down  card, which he reveals was " Mirror Force . However, he says that the result won't be the same when the singles matches come around, and tells Adrian that they should do their best. Adrian is beyond angry, stating that it doesn't matter -  Tag Duel  or not, he's lost. This decreases his chances of becoming a Pro Duelist.  Principal MacKenzie  has promised to recommend those that defeat the Japanese Duelists to the  Pro League . He tells Jesse that they're nothing alike  and vows to become a better Pro Duelist than  Aster Phoenix .
 Aster is en route to  Duel Academy  via helicopter, with the pilot telling him they'll arrive in about thirty minutes. Aster muses that he didn't think he'd be Dueling academy students one day after participating in a Pro League tournament in Korea. He thinks that he couldn't turn Principal MacKenzie down though - despite being a pro, he is still technically a student at the American academy as well. He thinks he'll just have to enjoy himself as much as possible. Back at the Duel field, Jaden congratulates Alexis and Bastion, while Syrus teases Bastion, saying it's lucky Alexis was able to overcome Bastion's earlier mistake. Jaden states that Bastion got worked up due the presence of a certain person, and Bastion tells them to stop bringing it up.  Zane  and  Atticus  discuss the Duel, with Atticus saying that they must do at least as well as they did - Alexis is his sister, after all. Atticus asks Zane what her partner's name was again, and Zane responds. Atticus says he can tell just by looking at him that he's got his eyes on Alexis and that as her older brother, he'll have to put a stop to that.
 Crowler announces that the next Tag Duel will begin, and that since one of the Amercian students hasn't yet arrived,  Axel  and  James  will team by default. Their opponents will be picked at random from among the three remaining Japanese students via a lottery application on his  PDA . The selection is Syrus teaming with  Chazz . Jaden asks what that means for him, and Crowler replies that the "drop-out boy" will Duel the last American student in a  singles match once the latter arrives. The Duel begins, and James goes first. He  Normal Summons  " Alli-Soldier " in  Defense Position  and  Sets  " Crocodile Scale ". Syrus Normal Summons " Tankroid " in Defense Position and Sets a card himself. Syrus realizes that James is using  Reptile - Type   monsters  and wonders what Axel will use. Axel Normal Summons " Electro Gunner " in  Attack Position  and Syrus realizes he must be using a  Machine  Deck. Axel  activates  " Electronic Motor ", which will increase the  ATK  of all Machine-Type monsters he  controls  by 300. Axel knows that "Alli-Soldier" has weak ATK and uses his  Academia Disk 's function to check what James'  face-down  card is. Seeing it's "Crocodile Scale", he switches "Alli-Soldier" to Attack Position. "Electro Gunner" attacks and destroys "Tankroid", with Syrus activating his face-down " Support Mission ", adding " Heliroid " from his Deck to his  hand . The  effect  of "Tankroid" also activates, letting Syrus  draw a card , which ends up being " Missile Roid " Axel attacks  directly  with James' "Alli-Soldier", dealing 1200 damage to Chazz and Syrus. He Sets  card to end his turn.
 James comments that it's about time that man with the  spirit  card made an appearance as Chazz draws. James tells him to show them the skills that defeated  David . Axel tells Chazz that he has things he must ask him about. Chazz draws " Burning Dragon ", while his hand contains " Dragon's Scent ", " Hurricane Dragon ", " Immortal Dragon " and two other cards. With their side of the field bare and the opponent with two monsters, Chazz knows they're in a bind, as he has no  Level  4 or lower monsters in his hand. He activates "Dragon's Scent", letting him Special Summon any  Dragon -Type monster from his hand if the opponent has two or more monster. Thus "Burning Dragon" is Summoned. Jaden is impressed that Chazz Summoned a high-level Dragon so early. Its effect activates, destroying all Spell and Trap Cards on the field - "Electronic Motor", "Crocodile Scale" and Axel's Set card, causing James to curse. "Burning Dragon" attacks and destroys "Alli-Soldier", reducing James and Axel to 2700 Life Points. Jaden compliments Chazz's play and Syrus thinks that Chazz is definitely an amazing Duelist - but that he can't afford to lose any more than Chazz says. Chazz Sets "Immortal Dragon" and James draws " Dark Alligator ", telling Chazz not to get cocky - the Duel has only just begun.
