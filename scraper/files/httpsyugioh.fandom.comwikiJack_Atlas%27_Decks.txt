Jack plays a  Power Deck , featuring both  Burn  and  Beatdown  elements. He deals damage as fast as possible while attempting to  Synchro Summon  " Red Dragon Archfiend ". His Deck is the opposite of Yusei's. Yusei prefers a defensive and adapting style, whereas Jack's is mainly offensive and punishes his opponents for defensive play, probably to show their rivalry.
 Many of his monsters are capable of inflicting  piercing  damage, while his  Trap Cards  can deal much  effect damage  and aide in Summoning. Jack shows an antipathy toward Continuous Spells/Traps, as he has many cards to counter them, like " Sinister Sprocket ", " Trap Eater " and " Power Breaker ". His Deck uses a high proportion of  Fiend  and  Rock - Type  monsters, and a fair number of  Warrior ,  Dragon , and  Machine -Types. Jack plays various archetypes like " Resonator ", and " Archfiend " monsters.
 Since the first season, Jack's Deck style has gone through a variety of changes. Over time, it has come to rely less on sheer power and more on strategy. His new Deck's "Blazing Soul" style focuses its strength into inflicting damage while at the same time swarming his field with Tuners to Synchro Summon " Red Nova Dragon " quickly. Like Yusei, he also has access to stronger cards such as " Majestic Red Dragon " for more intense opponents like Dark Signer  Carly  and  Fake Jack . Jack has two Decks, one for Turbo Duels, and one for normal Duels.

 Jack used a  Power/ Burn  Deck  based around his ace monster, " Red Dragon Archfiend ". He also used various cards to show off his status as the King by letting his opponent get the upper hand, then quickly sweep them off their feet. He also uses an array of  Trap Cards  to maximize the abilities of his "Red Dragon Archfiend", by protecting it from various card effects and boosting its  ATK . Jack used this Deck throughout his days as 'The King' as well as within the  Fortune Cup  tournament where he lost his title to  Yusei Fudo .

 After his embarrassing loss to  Andre  and acquiring " Red Nova Dragon ", Jack shifts his strategy to being more flexible and less reckless, primarily focused on easily  swarming  the field with material for his "Red Nova Dragon" through cards such as " Tuner's Reflect " and his " Resonators ". As well as this, he also uses several cards to negate effect damage like " Power Giant " and " Crimson Fire ". Jack also uses cards such as " Monster Baton " to assist his team mates during the World Racing Grand Prix duels.
