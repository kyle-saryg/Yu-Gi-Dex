 Abilities 
 ZEXAL Morph 
         Yuma and Astral begin ZEXAL Morph.     
         ZEXAL lineart.     
 ZEXAL Morph  ( Xyz Change ZEXAL  in the Japanese version, エクシーズ・チェンジ・ゼアル  Ekushīzu Chenji Zearu ) combines  Yuma  and  Astral , with them referring to it as "overlaying" with one-another as in an  Xyz Summon . During this time, Yuma and Astral are cloaked by auras: Yuma with red mist and Astral with blue mist, their souls combining into a new body. With this, Yuma/Astral wears a white suit that resembles spandex with red armor plating, his right eye becomes golden like Astral's left one, his hair turns gold and he gains a golden aura. [1]  While using ZEXAL (and its subsequent forms), Yuma and Astral are recognized by the  Augmented Reality  system as one Duelist under the name "ZEXAL".
 ZEXAL can only be used in a pseudo-space condition that is or mimics  alternate dimensions , such as the space inside the  Emperor's Key  or a  Sphere Field . [2]  Astral characterizes ZEXAL as a miraculous power that once protected the  Astral World , [1]  but  The Door  describes as the ability that can "turn darkness into light". [3] 
 
 Shining Draw 
 Main article:  Shining Draw (ability) 
         ZEXAL performing a  Shining Draw .     
 The primary utility of ZEXAL is the ability to perform a  Shining Draw . This enables the Duelist to create and  draw  a new card specifically to counter the situation they find themselves in. [1]  The ability can also be used on pre-existing cards, essentially modifying the Duelist's Deck order. [2] [4] 
 
         Yuma using a " ZW - " to save himself and  Vetrix .     
 The cards can be used outside of Duels, as Yuma used " Lightning Blade " to anchor himself and  Vetrix  to the walls of the  Sphere Field  in order to avoid being absorbed into the core. 
 The draw does not necessarily have to be done during the  Draw Phase .  Card effects  that enabling drawing can also be turned into Shining Draws. [2] 
 
 Upgrades 
 Dark ZEXAL 
 Main article:  Dark ZEXAL 
         ZEXAL falls into  darkness .     
 During their Duel with  Vector  at  Sargasso ,  Yuma  and  Astral  attempted ZEXAL. Vector reminded Astral of the information Yuma had hid from him, prompting the darkness within Astral's heart to spread. Astral forcefully initiated ZEXAL with Yuma again, sending both of them into a black hole, which resulted in  Dark ZEXAL . [5]  In this form, Astral had sole control of Yuma's body, effectively banishing Yuma to another plane of existence. In a berserker-like rage, Astral performed a  Dark Draw  to equip " Number C39: Utopia Ray V " with " DZW - Chimera Clad ". Vector's counter to this move formed an infinite loop that could only be stopped if Astral stopped calling for attacks. Instead, Astral continually ordered "Utopia Ray V" to attack " Number 104: Masquerade ". Yuma was able to find Astral in his consciousness and reconciled with him there, just in time to stop the attack that would have reduced them to critical  Life Points  and cause them to lose at the End Phase due to "Sargasso". Dark ZEXAL was canceled as a result. [6] 
 
 ZEXAL II 
 Main article:  ZEXAL II 
 Having renewed their bonds with one another,  Yuma  and  Astral  performed ZEXAL Morph against  Vector  again. This time, they came out as  ZEXAL II . In this form, they have access to the  Shining Evolution  ability, which lets them modify a card and unlock its "true form". [6]  They still have access to  Shining Draw , as well. [7] 
 
 ZEXAL III 
 Main article:  ZEXAL III 
 After  Yuma  journeyed to the  Astral World  to get Astral back, they returned to  Earth , where they took over  Kite Tenjo 's Duel with  Mr. Heartland . The merging of Earth and the  Barian World  had damaged Kite enough that he fell unconscious. Yuma and Astral countered this via ZEXAL, this time emerging as  ZEXAL III , proving their bond to be stronger than ever before. [8] 
 The earlier forms of ZEXAL are still accessible. In the ZEXAL wielders and  Nash 's final Duel against  Don Thousand , all three forms were utilized in chronological order. [9] 
 
 History 
 Anime 
 While searching for  Astral ,  Yuma's Deck  case started to glow and he was brought to  The Door . It told Yuma about "ZEXAL", and Yuma is returned. While Astral was  Dueling   Kite  and was fading, whispering Yuma's name, Yuma entered the computer chamber, and Astral shed a tear. The  Emperor's Key  reacted, and bursts with light, breaking the glass that surrounded it. The Key moved to Yuma, and sent him back to The Door. The Door opened, and Yuma telepathically talked to Astral, asking for his condition, and Astral tells him it is not going well. Yuma talked to him about ZEXAL, Yuma then runs through the door, of the edge of a dark cliff, and becomes cloaked in the red light that also appears during an  Xyz Summon . Using its power, Yuma performed a Shining Draw, creating " ZW - Unicorn Spear " which negated the effects of  Galaxy-Eyes Photon Dragon  allowing Yuma to destroy it. This forces Kite to activate a  face-down card  that ends the Duel in a draw. He flees, allowing Yuma and Astral to retrieve the Emperor's Key. [1] 
 The power was later used in Yuma's Duel against  Trey  in the gateway to the  Barian World . After combining with  Astral , Yuma drew " ZW - Phoenix Bow " and equipped it to " Number C39: Utopia Ray " to  destroy  " Number 6: Chronomaly Atlandis ", allowing Yuma to defeat Trey which prompted him to leave "Atlandis" and " Number 33: Chronomaly Machu Mech " for them, as well as the final  Heart Piece  needed to compete in the  World Duel Carnival  semi-finals. [10] 
 The power was again called upon during Yuma's Duel against  Vetrix . After combining, Yuma drew " ZW - Lightning Blade " and equipped it to "Utopia Ray", preparing to retaliate against " Number 69: Heraldry Crest ". [2]  He later acquired " ZW - Tornado Bringer " and combined it with " ZW - Lightning Blade " to create the first " ZW - "  Xyz Monster , " ZW - Leo Arms " to negate the effects of "Heraldry Crest" and destroy it, allowing Yuma and Astral to win the Duel and giving Yuma the title of Duel Champion. [11] 
 
         ZEXAL used in the final Duel against  Vector  and  Dr. Faker .     
 During the final Duel against  Vector  and  Dr. Faker , the power was utilized again. Yuma drew " ZW - Ultimate Shield " and activated its first effect to return "Utopia Ray", " Number C32: Shark Drake Veiss " and " Neo Galaxy-Eyes Photon Dragon " back to the field. He equipped "Ultimate Shield" to "Utopia Ray" and strengthened its  DEF  with " Xyz Unity " to transfer all 3  Xyz Monsters ' DEF to the ATK of "Utopia Ray" and sending it to attack " Number 92: Heart-eartH Dragon ". Triggering the other effect of "Ultimate Shield" negated the effect of "Heart-eartH Dragon" that would inflict effect damage, letting "Utopia Ray" destroy it and win the Duel. This released Dr. Faker from Vector's possession and temporarily ended the machination to destroy the  Astral World . [12] 
 
         ZEXAL used inside the  Barian Sphere Cube  against  Alito .     
 Yuma and Astral used this power once again during their rematch against  Alito , as a dedication to the Barian Emperor's honor and fighting spirit. Yuma drew " ZW - Eagle Claw " and equipped it to "Utopia Ray" giving it 2000 extra  ATK  and attacked " Number C105: Battlin' Boxer Comet Cestus ", but was forced to activate the second effect of "Eagle Claw", negating and destroying a Trap Card in order to prevent Alito from inflicting effect damage on him using " Battle Rush ". Alito then activated his face-down " Corkscrew Counter ", allowing him to negate the effect of "Eagle Claw", and then inflict 500 damage to Yuma. Yuma retaliated by activating his Set " Last Chance ", which could only be activated when Alito activated his Counter Trap Card; Yuma was able to choose one Trap Card from Alito's Graveyard and activate it as his own Counter Trap Card. He selects Alito's " Counter Clash ", which was activated when Alito activated a Counter Trap Card during the battle. This allowed him to negate its activation and destroy it, then double all Battle Damage during this Battle Phase. "Utopia Ray" attacked and destroyed "Comet Cestus", winning Yuma the Duel. [13] 
 During their second rematch against  Vector  at  Sargasso , Yuma and Astral attempted ZEXAL. Vector reminded Astral of the information Yuma had hid from him, prompting the darkness within Astral's heart to spread. Astral forcefully initiated ZEXAL with Yuma again, sending both of them into a black hole, which resulted in  Dark ZEXAL . [5]  In this form, Astral had sole control of Yuma's body, effectively banishing Yuma to another plane of existence. In a berserker rage, Astral performed a  Dark Draw  to equip " Number C39: Utopia Ray V " with " DZW - Chimera Clad ". Vector's counter to this move formed an infinite loop that could only be stopped if Astral stopped calling for attacks. Instead, Astral continually ordered "Utopia Ray V" to attack " Number 104: Masquerade ". Yuma was able find Astral in his consciousness and reconciled with him there, just in time to stop the attack that would have reduced them to critical  Life Points  and cause them to lose at the End Phase due to "Sargasso". Dark ZEXAL was canceled as a result. [6] 
 Having renewed their bonds with one another, Yuma and Astral performed ZEXAL Morph against  Vector  again. This time, they came out as  ZEXAL II . In this form, they have access to the  Re-Contract Universe  ability, which lets them modify a card and unlock its "true form". [6]  They still have access to  Shining Draw , as well. [7] 
 The earlier forms of ZEXAL are still accessible. In the ZEXAL wielders and Nash's final Duel against  Don Thousand , all three forms were utilized in order. [9] 
 During the final Duel against  Don Thousand , Yuma and Astral briefly utilized this form to preform a Shining Draw, drawing " Re-Xyz ." They soon ascended to the  upgraded form of ZEXAL. 
 
 Manga 
 During their Duel with  E'Rah , Yuma and Astral called up on the power of ZEXAL for the first time – performing ZEXAL Morph. Unlike in anime, they link their hands and appear on the field in a fused form. Astral refers to this power as "legend of the Astral World." The two then proceed to perform a Shining Draw to create  Shining Hope Road . Using its power, they create three  Number S  and absorbing these numbers to Summon  Hope ZEXAL . This monster appears to be Yuma and Astral together as one with absorbed Shining Numbers. [14]
