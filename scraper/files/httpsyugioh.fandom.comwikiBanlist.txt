 World Championship 
 During  World Championship  tournaments, all cards are automatically set to their lowest allowed  status  in any region. (For example, a card that is on the  Semi-Limited  list in one region but the  Limited  list in another will be Limited on the World Championship banlist, and a card that is Forbidden in one region but  Unlimited  in another will be Forbidden.)
 However, in addition to any cards that are Forbidden on either the  OCG  or  TCG  lists, several other cards are also made Forbidden:
 
 Any cards that are  not legal  in any region, including:
 Any  TCG exclusive  or  OCG exclusive  cards 
 Any cards that had only been released in the  TCG  as  Shonen Jump  or  manga promotional cards  (for a complete list, see the  not legal  article)
 Cards that are exclusive to one  TCG  region but have been released by other methods (such as " Shiba-Warrior Taro " and cards exclusive to  McDonald's Promotional Cards 2 ) are not Forbidden 
 From  2015  onward, any cards that have only been released in any region as preview cards (such as preview cards for the next main set included in  Special Editions ) 
 Any cards that are only available as tournament prize cards in any region, due to their extremely restricted availability:
 These currently include the following four  Yu-Gi-Oh! Championship Series  prize cards: " Blood Mefist ", " Ascension Sky Dragon ", and " Number 93: Utopia Kaiser " 
 In  2015  and  2016 , the previous year's tournament prize card was  Limited  instead of Forbidden 
 A select few "Special Rule" cards: " Emergency Provisions ", " Mystik Wok ", " Rainbow Life ", " Tri-And-Guess ", and " Self-Destruct Button "
 These cards have an undesirable potential to abuse the "sudden death" and time limit rules in official tournaments. The first four cards allow a player in "sudden death" to instantly win by quickly gaining a large number of  Life Points  during the opponent's turn with a now-irrelevant  cost , while the last card allows a player to legally  stall  by forcing  DRAWs  until the time limit runs out (see the  Tips  page of that card for details). 
 Anime and manga 
 During the  Battle City  arc it is mentioned that cards that  directly damage  the player, such as " Hinotama ", " Meteor of Destruction ", and " Raigeki ", are Forbidden. [1] 
 When taken to the  Virtual World , the  Egyptian God  cards were excluded from the virtual card database, since  Lector  noted they are forbidden cards. [2] 
 A handful of other cards are noted by characters as "Forbidden" in the anime, including " Golden Castle of Stromberg " in  Yu-Gi-Oh! , [3]  " Chaos Emperor Dragon - Envoy of the End " [4]  and " Infernalvania " in  Yu-Gi-Oh! GX , [5]  " Gate Blocker " and " Gate Blocker 2 " in official  Turbo Duels  in  Yu-Gi-Oh! 5D's , [6] [7]  and " Restraining Sword of Impact " in  Yu-Gi-Oh! ARC-V . [8] 
 In addition, though not stated, the anime appears to follow real life ban lists. For example,  Jaden Yuki  stopped using  Mirage of Nightmare  after it was banned in real life,  Yuya Sakaki  stopped using  Monster Reborn  (and started using it again when it was unbanned),  Pot of Greed  stopped being used (with most characters using it until it was banned), and most famously  Yusaku Fujiki  stopped using his  Signature card   Firewall Dragon  after it was banned.
