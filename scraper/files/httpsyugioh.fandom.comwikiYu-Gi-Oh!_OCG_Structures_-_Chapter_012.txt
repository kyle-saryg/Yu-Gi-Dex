 Summary 
 Featured Duel: Light Tsukiko vs. Ms. Guide 
 Turn 1: Ms. Guide 
Ms. Guide's hand contains " Darklord Ixchel ", " Darklord Nasten ", " Darklord Superbia ", " Darklord Tezcatlipoca " and " Darklord Contact ". Ms. Guide  discards  "Darklord Ixchel", as well as "Superbia", to  activate  the former's  effect  to  draw  two cards. Next, she activates "Darklord Contact"  Normal Spell Card  to revive "Superbia" ( Level  8/2900/2400) in  Defense Position , whose effect enables her to  Special Summon  "Ixchel" from her  GY  in Defense Position, too (Level 10/2500/2900). She then  sets  a card.
 Turn 2: Light Tsukiko 
As Ms. Guide controls more  Spells / Traps  than Light Tsukiko does, the latter Special Summons " Psychic Megacyber " from her hand (Level 6/2200/1200). Next, she  Normal Summons  " Jinzo - Jector " (Level 4/800/2000), then tributes it to add a " Jinzo " card (" Jinzo the Machine Menace ") from her  Deck  to her  hand . Moreover, it reveals all of Ms. Guide's set cards in her  Spell & Trap Zone : the set card is " Darklord Descent ", and since it is a Trap Card, the effect of "Jinzo - Jector" lets her Special Summon one "Jinzo" monster: she selects "Jinzo the Machine Menace" (Level 7/2400/1500) in Attack Position.
 She then tributes it to Special Summon "Jinzo" (Level 6/2400/1500) in Attack Position, whose effect destroys all Trap Cards - like "Darklord Descent" - and negates the activation of Trap Cards and their effects. Light Tsukiko then overlays "Jinzo" and "Psychic Megacyber",  Xyz Summoning  " Jinzo - Layered " ( Rank  6/2400/1500) in Attack Position. She detaches the "Layered's" " Jinzo "  Xyz Material  to activate its effect, taking  control  of Ms. Guide's "Darklord Ixchel".
