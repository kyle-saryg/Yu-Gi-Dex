 You can activate this card while you have no  DARK  monsters in your hand. [1] 
 " Mystical Refpanel " can be Chained to " Allure of Darkness ".  The opposite player will draw and then either send his hand to the Graveyard or banish 1  DARK  monster. [2] 
 If " Imperial Iron Wall " is active, then you cannot activate " Allure of Darkness ".  If " Imperial Iron Wall " is Chained to " Allure of Darkness " and you have no  DARK  monsters in your hand, then you send your hand to the Graveyard.  If you have a  DARK  monster in your hand, you cannot banish it, so you only show it to your opponent. [3] 
 Mentions in Other Rulings 
 Exodia the Forbidden One : For cards like " Graceful Charity ", " Dark World Dealings ", " Solar Recharge ", " Allure of Darkness ", " Common Charity ", and similar cards: if you draw the fifth piece of " Exodia the Forbidden One " through this effect, then you declare victory after you finish fully resolving the effect.  If the second part of the effect causes you to discard a piece, then after you finish fully resolving the effect " Exodia the Forbidden One " is no longer complete, so you cannot declare victory. [4] 
 Previously Official Rulings 
   These TCG rulings were issued by  Upper Deck Entertainment  and have since been deemed unofficial by Konami. [5]  They were previously considered official and can still be correct, as long as they follow the official gameplay rules, or unless Konami has issued a ruling that says otherwise.
