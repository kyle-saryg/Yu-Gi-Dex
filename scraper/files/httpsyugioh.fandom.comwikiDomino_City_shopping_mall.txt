      Domino City shopping mall     
 The  shopping mall  (ショッピングモール  shoppingu mōru ) in  Domino City  is a location, appearing in  Yu-Gi-Oh! The Dark Side of Dimensions .
 
 History 
 Otogi's father  opened a  cafe  at the mall, employing  Ryuji Otogi  as a waiter and  Katsuya Jonouchi  as a mascot.
 Yugi Mutou ,  Anzu Mazaki ,  Hiroto Honda  and  Ryo Bakura  ate here at Otogi's cafe. Yugi, Anzu, Bakura and Honda discussed the mysterious worldwide disappearances. Bakura commented on the unease he felt, knowing someone could be secretly watching them, but Anzu they were probably harmless and gestured to  Bakura's fanclub , who had secretly been watching him.
 News of  Seto Kaiba 's  new Duel Disk  was shown on a big screen in the mall. Jonouchi groaned, suspecting it would be expensive and was teased by Honda. Since Honda was mending Jonouchi's  older model Duel Disk , Jonouchi took the opportunity to accuse him of breaking it, demanding compensation. This led to a fight, resulting in Jonouchi's firing.
 Diva  monitored Yugi, Bakura and their friends from the upstairs balcony in the mall. A projection of  Mani  appeared next to him and tried to talk him out of his revenge plans, claiming it is not what  Shadi Shin  would want. When Mani informed him that the  Millennium Puzzle  had been found his projection disappeared and Diva teleported to the  Valley of the Kings . His sudden displacement was noted by Seto Kaiba, who later asked how he was able to quickly travel from one part of the world to another, while showing footage of him at the mall.
