 Summary 
   This summary is currently incomplete. 
 Yuto  attempts to catch  Shingo  off guard when he expected to be facing  Yuya . But  Reiji , suspecting the new figure to be more than he appears, instructs Shingo to capture Yuto as a possible accomplice. Shingo complies and proceeds to use Leo Corp's  Solid Vision  system to materialize " Haunted Demon Den " to begin an  Action Duel  with  Yuzu  watching the duel unfold from from the rooftop of a neighboring building. Despite the voice telling Yuto to move and grab as much  Action Cards  as he can, Shingo makes the first move and gets an Action Card while using the effect of his " Underworld Knight Eidos " to  Tribute Summon  " Demon Emperor Angmar " to slashe Yuto’s life points in half within one turn. But Yuto retaliates by using the two " Phantom Knights Shade Brigandine " cards he set and special summoned due to their effect to  Xyz Summon  " Dark Rebellion XYZ Dragon " and destroy Angmarl, Reiji having expected an  Pendulum Summon .
 But Shingo is unfazed by the damage, using his " Dark Advance " trap to summon Angmarl back to his field so he can sacrifice the monster to summon " Underworld Emperor Erebus " while sending Dark Rebellion XYZ Dragon back to Yuto's extra deck and disabling Yuto. It was then Yuto hears Yuya's voice in his head asking to be tagged in, though Yuto tells the voice to shut up as he got them into this mess in the first place. But Yuya, telling Yuto to lecture him later while promising to finish the Duel, forceful regains control of their body. While everyone is shocked to see him transform from Yuto into their quarry, Yuya formally introduces himself while stating that the fun has just begun.
 
 Featured Duel: Yuto/Yuya Sakaki vs. Shingo Sawatari 
 At the start of the Duel, the  Field Spell Card  " Haunted Demon Den " is activated, as per the rules of an  Action Duel .
 Turn 1: Shingo 
 Shingo   Normal Summons  " Underworld Knight Eidos " (800/1000). Next, he gets an  Action Card , " Haunted Missile ", and  activates  it, inflicting 1000  damage  to  Yuto  (Yuto: 4000 → 3000 LP). Shingo activates the effect of "Eidos", which allows him to  Tribute Summon  once in addition to his Normal Summon/ Set  the  turn  it is Normal Summoned; he  Tributes  "Eidos" to Tribute Summon " Demon Emperor Angmar " (2400/1000). Upon being Tribute Summoned, the effect of "Angmar" activates, allowing Shingo to  banish  one  Spell Card  from his  Graveyard  to activate that card's effect. He banishes "Haunted Missile", inflicting 1000 more damage to Yuto (Yuto: 3000 → 2000 LP). Shingo Sets 1 card.
 Turn 2: Yuto 
Yuto gets an Action Card, " Haunted Legend Pair Card 1 ", but is unable to activate it, since that card requires another corresponding Action Card to be activated. Yuto Sets 2 cards and activates them right away, since he has no  Trap Cards  in his Graveyard; he activates two copies of " Phantom Knights Shade Brigandine ", which  Special Summon  themselves as  Level  4  monsters  in  Defense Position  ( DEF  800). Yuto overlays his two Level 4 monsters to  Xyz Summon  " Dark Rebellion XYZ Dragon " (2500/2000), and activates its effect right away,  detaching  its two  Overlay Units  to halve the  ATK  of "Angmar" ("Angmar": 2400 → 1200 ATK) and increase its own ATK by the same amount ("Dark Rebellion": 2500 → 3700 ATK). "Dark Rebellion"  attacks  and  destroys  "Angmar" (Shingo: 4000 → 1500 LP). Upon the destruction of "Angmar", Shingo activate his  face-down  " Dark Advance ", Tribute Summoning the destroyed "Angmar" back from his Graveyard. Yuto Sets 1 card.
 Turn 3: Shingo 
Shingo gets an Action Card. He Tributes his Tribute Summoned "Angmar" to Tribute Summon " Underworld Emperor Erebus " (2800/1000). Upon its Tribute Summon, the effect of "Erebus" activates; Shingo  sends  " Emperor's Freezing Air " and " Emperor's Lava Attack " from his  Deck  to the Graveyard to return "Dark Rebellion" to Yuto's  Extra Deck . Next, he activates the effect of "Emperor's Freezing Air", banishing itself and "Emperor's Lava Attack" from his Graveyard to destroy Yuto's face-down " Phantom Knights Tomb Shield ". Shingo attacks Yuto  directly  with "Erebus", but Yuto activates " Phantom Knights Dark Gauntlet " from his  hand ; since he  controls  no cards, Yuto Special Summons "Dark Gauntlet" as a Level 4 monster in Defense Position (DEF 600); furthermore, its DEF increases by 300 for each " Phantom Knights " card in his Graveyard ("Dark Gauntlet": 600 → 1500 DEF). A  replay  occurs, and Shingo attacks "Dark Gauntlet" with "Erebus", activating the Action Card " Haunted Lance ", which increases the ATK of "Erebus" by 500 and allows it to inflict  piercing   battle damage  ("Erebus": 2800 → 3300 ATK). "Erebus" destroys "Dark Gauntlet" (Yuto: 2000 → 200 LP). Shingo Sets 1 card. At the end of the turn, the ATK of "Erebus" returns to normal ("Erebus": 3300 → 2800 ATK).
 Turn 4: Yuto 
At this point,  Yuya  takes over for Yuto.
 Duel continues in the next Scale .
