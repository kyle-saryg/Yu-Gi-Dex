 " White Knight ", known by the possessive form " White Knight's " ( 白騎士団の   Howaito Naitsu ) in Japan, is an  archetype  of  LIGHT   Warrior   monsters  briefly used by  Chazz Princeton  while in the  Society of Light . They were given to Chazz by  Sartorius . Their  effects  are focused on supporting one another and summoning their  ace card , " White Knight Lord ". All members of this archetype are  Level  4 monsters, except for the Level 7 "White Knight Lord".
 Chazz easily defeats  pro  Duelist  Gelgo  with them, and then proceeds to challenge  Jaden Yuki , who ends up using Chazz's own " Ojama " cards against him. When Jaden frees Chazz from the Society's influence, Chazz is confused to see himself using the "White Knight" cards and Jaden using his "Ojama" cards. Accusing Jaden of stealing his cards, Chazz manages to swap hands with Jaden during the Duel, reclaiming his "Ojamas", but loses in the process.
 The effects of these cards were later used for the " Phantom Beast " archetype.
