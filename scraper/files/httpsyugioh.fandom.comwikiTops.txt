       The highest rooftop in Tops.     
 Tops  is an upper class residential area, located in  New Domino City . The part of it where  Leo  and  Luna  live is said to be the highest part of New Domino.
 Yusei Fudo  was born here, but was sent to live in an orphanage in  Satellite  after his parents died during the  Zero Reverse  incident; this is unknown to the public. 
 To hide  Jack Atlas ' background, the public was told that he was born here, rather than Satellite. The public later learned that Jack was in fact, born in Satellite.
