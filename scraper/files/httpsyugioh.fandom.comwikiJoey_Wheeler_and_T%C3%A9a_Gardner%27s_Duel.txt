 Joey Wheeler and Téa Gardner's Duel  was a game of  Duel Monsters  between  Joey Wheeler  and  Téa Gardner  in the  Yu-Gi-Oh!  anime . It is based on  their Duel  from  the manga .
 Most of the Duel took place off screen and Téa easily won, due to Joey's unbalance pure- monster  Deck.
 In the Japanese, anime and the English uncut dub, they were only shown Dueling once in this instance. In the English cut dub, they were said to have played another four off-screen Duels, all of which were won by Téa.

 The Duel 
 Joey  Summoned  " Rock Ogre Grotto #1 " in  Attack Mode  and bragged about how strong it was. Téa flipped over " Happy Lover ", which Joey mocked for being weak.
 Téa activated " Breath of Light ", eroding Joey's monster into dust and blowing it away. Joey's  Life Points  dropped to 0, causing Téa to win.
 
 Aftermath 
 Frustrated by his inability to win, Joey begged  Yugi  to tell him what he was doing wrong, so Yugi took a look at his Deck and was surprised to find it contained only  Monster Cards . Joey grinned that he stuffed it with the toughest monsters he could find. However Yugi explained that the biggest strategy in the game is combining monsters with  Magic Cards  and if someone fights with monsters alone, the opponent can easily dodge their attacks. Joey thought about that and then begged Yugi to help make him better, so Yugi invited him over to  his house  after school, since the  Japanese National Duel Monsters Championship  was on TV that night.
