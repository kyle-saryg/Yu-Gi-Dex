 Story 
 New Domino City, in the year 20XX, Turbo Duels, fought from the seats of motorcycled-shaped duel disks called "Duel Runners," are the hottest game in town. 
 Yusei Fudo, the toughest Duelist in Satellite, suffered a painful loss to Jack Atlas. In order to duel Jack again, Yusei entered the D1 Grand Prix, the battle to determine the strongest duelist in the world!! As the strongmen of the dueling world slugged it out, Yusei fought his way into the second round, where he beat, Crow, Leo and Luna, and won his own Duel Dragon, Stardust Spark Dragon! In Seibal's Corridor of the Northern Sky, he found himself facing the Skeleton Knight. Meanwhile, in the Corridor of the Southern Sky, Jack and Rex face off. Who will win and reach Sect? [2] 
 
 In the Next Volume… 
 Forced to duel his friend Sect, Yusei plays his most powerful cards. Will the duel end their friendship, or their lives?
