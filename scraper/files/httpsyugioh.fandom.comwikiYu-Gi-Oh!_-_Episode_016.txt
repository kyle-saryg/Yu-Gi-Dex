 Summary 
   This summary is currently incomplete. 
 The episode starts with  Maximillion Pegasus  in his executive office talking to  The Big Five  about their deal to take over  KaibaCorp .  Seto Kaiba , meanwhile, is flying to  Duelist Kingdom  in his helicopter to save  Mokuba . 
 Yugi  and  Bakura  notice that Bakura's  Millennium Ring  can point to the direction of other  Millennium Items  and that it has been honing in on Pegasus's  Millennium Eye . Bakura explains that the same thing happened the day he was transferred into their class. His Millennium Ring was pointing to Yugi's  Millennium Puzzle  while he and  Joey  were  Dueling . (The flashback shows Yugi has " Celtic Guardian " and " Beaver Warrior " out on his field while Joey has " Axe Raider " on his field. Joey then  Summons  " Battle Warrior ".) Everyone is deep asleep, except for Yugi, who is thinking about what lies ahead of him. 
 Just then, Kaiba's helicopter arrives and wakes everyone up. Kaiba steps off and Yugi gives him back his  Deck . He goes to leave, but Yugi asks to join him since they are both headed towards  Pegasus Castle . Words are exchanged between them that make Joey very angry about Kaiba's attitude. 
 He grabs Kaiba and challenges him, but Kaiba knocks Joey to the ground. When Joey gets up, the two insult each other to the point where they face off in a Duel using Kaiba's new  Duel Disk  system. Joey is repeatedly pounded by " Rabid Horseman " until he  Summons  " Red-Eyes Black Dragon " to  destroy  it.
 However, Kaiba summons " Blue-Eyes White Dragon ", destroying "Red-Eyes Black Dragon" and winning the Duel. He then explains to the group about Pegasus' mysterious powers. 
 Sometime ago at the Intercontinental Championship in New York City, Seto Kaiba was one of Pegasus' guests of honor. In the final round, Pegasus was dueling a man named  Bandit Keith . Pegasus just played with Keith, then wrote something on a piece of paper and called a  kid  from the audience. 
 Keith protested that asking for help is illegal. However, Pegasus says he doesn't need help. A child could beat him and he will prove it. Although the kid told him he only started to learn how to play last week Pegasus assures him, to follow the instructions and he'll win. Keith Summons " Garnecia Elefantis ".
 The kid follows the instructions and Summons " Flying Elephant " in Attack Position, which for some unknown reason, defeats Keith. Kaiba is clearly surprised by this. Yugi says something like this happened to him when he first faced Pegasus.
 Yugi and Kaiba may not agree on most things, but they both know that Pegasus must be stopped. Kaiba leaves the group and heads for the Pegasus' castle, unaware that Pegasus is watching him with his Millennium Eye.
 
 Featured Duels 
 Maximillion Pegasus vs. Bandit Keith (flashback) 
 Most of the Duel is skipped.  Pegasus  then calls a kid named  Sam  to Duel in his place and gives him instructions to win.
 Keith's turn 
 Keith  draws " Garnecia Elefantis ". At this point, Pegasus has Sam Duel in his place. Keith then  Normal Summons  "Garnecia Elefantis" (2400/2000) in  Attack Position .
 Sam's turn 
Sam Normal Summons " Flying Elephant " (1850/1300) in Attack Position.
 Sam wins. How the two monsters interacted and caused Keith to lose is not specified.

"Battle Ox" destroys "Flame Swordsman" (Joey: 1800 → 1600 LP).

 Turn 19: Kaiba 
Kaiba draws " Blue-Eyes White Dragon " and subsequently Normal Summons it (3000/2500) in Attack Position. "Blue-Eyes White Dragon" attacks and destroys "Red-Eyes Black Dragon" (Joey: 500 → 0 LP).
 
 Mistakes 
 When Kaiba fuses " Mystic Horseman " and " Battle Ox ", he is wearing a  Dueling Gauntlet , despite not owning one. 
 For a split second you can see the Japanese  Life Points  counter the second time the Life Points screen appears after "Armored Lizard" is destroyed. 
 In the Japanese version, when Battle Ox is summoned, the graphic has its DEF at 900 instead of 1000. 
 Differences in adaptations 
 Shots of  Kaiba 's briefcase are cut out from the dub version. 
 Yami Yugi 's image (taken from a later episode) is added over the moon in the dub version. 
 A close-up of the axe that " Battle Ox " owns sinking then cutting into the neck of " Armored Lizard " is cut from the US version. 
 The writing scrolling across the bottom of the stadium display screens is removed from the US Version, even though it's unreadable. 
 Yami Yugi's appearances at the end of the episode are replaced with  Yugi 's. 
 When  Kaiba  throws  Joey  to the ground,  Bakura  tells Yugi to check Joey's pulse in the US adaptation. 
 In the Japanese version, Joey challenges Kaiba because he's angry that Kaiba wants to go to Pegasus' castle without having any  Star Chips  and to show him how much he progressed, while in the US adaptation, it's just because Kaiba is too pretentious and says that Joey and Yugi are just playing. 
 In the dub, Bandit Keith strangely calls Pegasus "cutie-pie"; in a later episode, it was changed to "mullet head".
