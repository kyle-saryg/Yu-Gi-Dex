 5d's 6/Zexal 5 Release Date. 
 Just thought I'd give a quick explanation on the edits for these Manga's and the dates. (think it only applies to one of them but mentioning both to be sure). The images I uploaded are screens from Amazon.co.uk, and the delivery dates are clearly shown. Now, Zexal 5 has a delivery date of 26/08, which obviously 3 days before that would be 23/08, however UK postal service never runs on a Sunday and isn't counted as a working day, thus 3 working days before the 26th would be the 22nd. I'm not sure how it works in other countries so sorry if this sounds a little patronising.  Photonkrios99  ( talk  •  contribs ) 19:55, November 24, 2013 (UTC)
 
 Amazon.co.uk import them from America. They are not officially distributed here, which means their insert cards are NOT legal for tournament play. You'll simply be confusing British and European players into thinking that they can use them, when they cannot.  Shamus  ( talk  •  contribs ) 07:19, November 29, 2013 (UTC) 
 No I'm not, I'm saying 'here a product, heres when it's released'. I don't even mention whether they are legal or not. Anyway regardless of legality of the cards, it's a page detailing product releases and they are being released in the out, to purchase from a  UK site, on those dates, all of which have been sourced. They are legitimate includes. Photonkrios99  ( talk  •  contribs ) 07:22, November 29, 2013 (UTC)
