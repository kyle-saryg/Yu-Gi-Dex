      The exhibition.     
 Egypt Unearthed  was an exhibition which took place at  Domino Museum . It contained items from a tomb from the New Kingdom Era, which  Professor Yoshimori  and  Curator Kanekura  had excavated two months earlier. [1] 
 Since  Yugi's   Grandpa  was good friends with Yoshimori, he was able to get Yugi,  Jonouchi ,  Anzu  and  Honda  (and  Miho  in the anime) [2]  free admission. [1] 
 At the museum, Kanekura begged Yugi to let him put the  Millennium Puzzle  on display. Yugi agreed to let him use it for one day. [1] 
 Yoshimori guided Yugi and his friends through the exhibition and explained the  Weighing of the Heart  ritual to them. [1] 
 Kanekura tried to sell the Millennium Puzzle before Yugi got a chance to take it back. However,  Shadi  confronted Kanekura over his theft and defilement of Egyptian tombs and made him take part in the Weighing of the Heart. Kanekura was killed through this and Shadi found the puzzle, which he later returned to Yugi. [1]
