 Blackwing - Shura the Blue Flame 
 CLARIFICATION: 
 The effect of “ Blackwing – Shura the Blue Flame ” activates when monsters are destroyed and sent to the Graveyard at the end of the  Damage Step .  This is the same timing as the effects of cards like “ Hydrogeddon ,” “ Blue Thunder T-45 ,” “ Goyo Guardian ,” and  “ Elemental Hero Flame Wingman ”  [ sic ] . 
 In order for its effect to activate, “ Blackwing – Shura the Blue Flame ” must be face-up on the field when the monster it destroyed by battle is sent to the Graveyard. This means:
 If  Shura  and the other monster destroy each other by battle (equal ATK),  Shura’s  effect does not activate. 
 If  Shura  is destroyed by a  Flip Effect  like “ Man-Eater Bug ,”  Shura’s  effect does not activate. 
 If  Shura  is flipped face-down after damage calculation by a card effect, such as “ Desertapir ,”  Shura’s  effect does not activate. 
 If  Shura  is  removed from play  [ sic ]  by battling “ D.D. Warrior ,”  Shura’s  effect does not activate. 
 If  Shura  is destroyed by an effect after the monster it destroyed by battle was sent to the Graveyard, such as “ Michizure ,”  Shura’s  effect DOES activate, and you can Special Summon a monster. 
 NOTE:  These rules also apply to any other monster with the text  “When this card destroys an opponent’s monster by battle and sends it to the Graveyard….”  (Examples: “ Hydrogeddon ,” “ Goyo Guardian ,” or  “ Elemental Hero Flame Wingman ”  [ sic ] .) 
 These rules do NOT apply to monsters with the text  “When this card destroys an opponent’s monster by battle….”  (but does not specify “and sends it to the Graveyard”). (Example: “ Blue Thunder T-45 ”.) Monsters with that text will activate their effects in ALL of the above scenarios. 
 Previously Official Rulings 
   These TCG rulings were issued by  Upper Deck Entertainment  and have since been deemed unofficial by Konami. [1]  They were previously considered official and can still be correct, as long as they follow the official gameplay rules, or unless Konami has issued a ruling that says otherwise. References:  [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] 
 
 If " Alien Mother " is  flipped  face-down, any monsters you Special Summoned with her effect are not destroyed. If the same " Alien Mother " is later removed from the field, even if was flipped face-up again, monsters you Special Summoned with her effect are not destroyed.
