 Summary 
   This summary is currently incomplete. 
 After  Captain Corn 's loss,  Mr. Heartland  appears before  Yuma . He reveals he is collecting the " Numbers " to destroy the  Astral World , because it is evil, and says  Astral  is the "messenger". Yuma and his friends defend Astral, but Mr. Heartland clicks his fingers, and a kind of door opens in the floor, making them fall in the " Speed Field ", another attraction in the  Heartland Theme Park . There, they find another  Numbers Hunter  from the Park,  Thunder Spark , who challenges Yuma to a " Speed Duel " in the "Speed Field". He also gives Yuma's friends a  helicopter , so that they can watch the Duel. However, as Yuma couldn't concentrate in the Duel and in the ride at the same time, Astral offered himself to instruct him what cards to play while he rides, and said Yuma to trust him. In response to Astral's feelings, Yuma gets very spirited and begins riding.
