 " Upstart Hunter " is the fourty-fifth episode of the  Yu-Gi-Oh! SEVENS  anime. It will first air in Japan on April 25, 2021.
 Fierce battles have unfolded during the Team Battle Royale tournament, and  Yuga  and co. have been racking up wins! The three members of the Dueling & Dinosaur Research Club then arrive before them. Wanting to spar with Yuga,  Hunt  challenges him to a Duel. For some reason, Hunt is acting like a totally different person...
 
 Featured Duel: Yuga Ohdo vs. Hunt 
 The duel is conducted as a  Rush Duel .
 Turn 1: Hunt 
Hunt activates " Upstart Goblin " to draw 1 card and allow Yuga to gain 1000 LP (Yuga: 4000 → 5000 LP). Hunt then activates the  Field Spell  " Jurassic World ". As long as "Jurassic World" is face-up:  Dinosaur  Monsters will gain 300 ATK and DEF. Hunt Normal Summons " Platinumdon " (0/1400) and " Celebrontosaurus " (1400/1000). Both gain 300 ATK and DEF from "Jurassic World" ("Platinumdon": 0/1400 → 300/1700, "Celebrontosaurus": 1400/1000 → 1700/1300). Hunt then Tributes both of his monsters to  Tribute Summon  " Zenigebazauls " (2400/1700) which also gains 300 ATK and DEF from "Jurassic World" ("Zenigebazauls" 2400/1700 → 2700/2000). Hunt activates the effect of "Zenigebazauls" as he has less  LP  than Yuga to place 1 card from his hand on the bottom of his deck (a second copy of "Platinumdon") to force both players to send the top 2 cards of their Deck to the  GY  and Yuga takes 400 damage for every monster sent to the GY by this effect, since 4 monsters were sent to the GY by this effect: Yuga takes 1600 damage (Yuga: 5000 → 3400 LP).
 Turn 2: Yuga 
Yuga Normal Summons " Luminous Shaman " (500/0) and " Luminous Parrot " (1200/600). He then tributes both of his monsters to Tribute Summon " Ice Age Catapult " (2400/1600). He then sets a monster and a card. Yuga then activates the effect of "Ice Age Catapult" since it was Normal Summoned this turn to return one  WATER  monster from his GY (he returns " Amazing Dealer ", which he sent to the GY via the effect of "Zenigebazauls") to the bottom of his Deck to return "Jurassic World" to Hunt's hand ("Zenigebazauls": 2700/2000 → 2400/1700) and to have "Zenigebazauls" lose 600 ATK and DEF until the end of the turn ("Zenigebazauls": 2400/1700 → 1800/1100). "Ice Age Catapult" attacks "Zenigebazauls" and destroys it (Hunt: 4000 → 3400LP).
 Turn 3: Hunt 
Hunt activates "Jurassic World" once again. He then  Maximum Summons  " Great Imperial Dinocarriage Dynarmix [L] " (1300/0), " Great Imperial Dinocarriage Dynarmix [R] " (1300/0) and " Great Imperial Dinocarriage Dynarmix " (1900/0).  Maximum Mode  makes their ATK their  Maximum ATK  and they are all treated as one monster ("Great Imperial Dinocarriage Dynarmix": 1900/0 → 3400/0) which also gains 300 ATK and DEF from "Jurassic World" ("Great Imperial Dinocarriage Dynarmix": 3400/0 → 3700/300). Hunt activates the effect of "Dynarmix" by sending a card from his hand to the GY whilst Yuga does not control a Level 9 or higher monster to destroy up to 2 monsters Yuga controls. "Ice Age Catapult" and Yuga's Set " Stray Familiar " are both destroyed. "Dynarmix" attacks Yuga directly but Yuga activates his Set " Curtain of Sparks " which will cause "Dynarmix" to lose 500 ATK until the end of the turn ("Dynarmix": 3700/300 → 3200/300). The attack continues (Yuga: 3400 → 200 LP). During the  End Phase , the effect of "Curtain of Sparks" expires ("Dynarmix": 3200/300 → 3700/300).
 Turn 4: Yuga 
At this point, Hunt explains that "Dynarmix" cannot be destroyed by battle if it battles a Level 7 or lower monster. Yuga activates the  Spell  " Do-or-Die Alliance " which allows Yuga to reveal 2 monsters in his hand to draw 1 card, if the drawn card is a monster of the same Level as the ones revealed: Yuga will take 1000 damage. Yuga reveals the Level 4 " Hyper Engine Vast Vulcan [L] " and the Level 3 " Hyper Engine Vast Vulcan [R] " and draws the Level 10 " Hyper Engine Vast Vulcan ". Yuga then Maximum Summons "Hyper Engine Vast Vulcan (L)" (900/0), "Hyper Engine Vast Vulcan (R)" (600/0) and "Hyper Engine Vast Vulcan" (1500/0). Their ATK becomes their Maximum ATK and they are all treated as one monster ("Hyper Engine Vast Vulcan": 1500/0 → 3300/0). Yuga activates the effect of "Vast Vulcan" granted from "Vast Vulcan (R)" to reduce the ATK of "Dynarmix" by 100 multiplied by its Level and inflict damage to Hunt equal to the ATK that "Dynarmix" lost by sending the top card of his deck to the GY (he sends " Kuribot "). Since "Dynarmix" is Level 10, it loses 1000 ATK ("Dynarmix": 3700/300 → 2700/300, Hunt: 3400 → 2400LP). He then activates the effect of "Vast Vulcan" granted from "Vast Vulcan (L)" to reduce the ATK of "Dynarmix" by 800 and destroy "Jurassic World" by sending the top card of his deck to the GY (he sends " Road Magic - Explosion ") ("Dynarmix": 2700/300 → 1900/300 → 1600/0). Since Yuga destroyed his opponent's Field Spell by this effect: Hunt takes 800 damage (Hunt: 2400 → 1600 LP). "Vast Vulcan" attacks "Dynarmix" (Hunt: 1600 → 0 LP).
