 Summary 
 Yami Yugi  continues his Duel with  Gansley . Due to his powerful Deck Master ability, Gansley appears to have a strong advantage. 
 Noah  shows  Kaiba  and  Mokuba  a projection of their lives at the orphanage in an attempt to emotionally weaken them. After an angry outburst by Mokuba, Kaiba realizes that Noah is trying to turn them against each other.
 They watch the day that Kaiba challenged  Gozaburo  to a chess match and won. Gozaburo had agreed to adopt the brothers if he lost. Present day Mokuba complains about Kaiba's change in attitude after that day and nearly falls into a bottomless pit after opening another virtual door. 
 Tristan  and  Duke  escape the hallway by destroying the walls with some halberds they take off some of the castle’s suits of armor. Once outside, they find  Serenity  being chased by a " Mad Sword Beast ". The pair rescue her when Tristan leaps off of the castle's upper balcony onto the Beast's back and leads it into a stream where it drowns. Despite this, Duke gets all the credit, making Tristan look bad. 
 Joey  continues to wander through the medieval manor in search of the Big 5 but still cannot find anyone. 
 Téa  is revealed to have been knocked unconscious during the ambush by her  Hitotsu-Me Giant  attackers who proceed to take her away as their captive. With one of them, presumably the leader, carrying the insensate girl over its shoulder, the giants march through the desert canyon and bring her to their den inside a cave. Once inside, Téa is thrown onto the rocky floor where she squirms in pain as her cyclops captors loom above.

 Featured Duel: Yami Yugi vs. Gansley 
 Duel continues from  the previous episode .
 Yami Yugi has 1900  Life Points  remaining and controls "Obnoxious Celtic Guardian (1400/1200) and "Chimera the Flying Mythical Beast" (2100/1800) in Attack Position.
 Gansley has 4000 Life Points remaining and controls no cards.
 Turn 4: Yugi 
" Obnoxious Celtic Guardian "  attacks   directly  (Gansley 4000 → 2600). Because Gansley received at least 1000 or more  Battle Damage , he  Special Summons  " Ruklamba the Spirit King " (1000/2000) from his  hand  in  Attack Position  via its own  effect .
 Turn 5: Gansley 
 Gansley   draws  " Yowie " and subsequently  Normal Summons  it (500/500) in Attack Position. Since "Yowie" was Normal Summoned, its effect activates, forcing  Yugi  to skip his next  Draw Phase . Gansley then activates " Premature Burial " to  pay  800  Life Points  (Gansley 2600 → 1800) and revive " Ipiria " (500/500) in Attack Position. The effect of "Ipiria" activates, allowing Gansley to draw one card. [Notes 1] 
 Turn 6: Yugi 
Due to the effect of "Yowie", Yugi skips his  Draw Phase . "Obnoxious Celtic Guardian" attacks "Ipiria", but Gansley activates his  Deck Master ability  to  negate  the attack and inflict  damage  to Yugi equal to the  ATK  of "Obnoxious Celtic Guardian" (Yugi 1900 → 500) by  Tributing  "Ipiria" and "Yowie". Gansley then activates the effect of "Ruklamba", Tributing it to Special Summon two monsters from his hand whose combined ATK are 2000 or less. He Special Summons " Wall of Illusion " (1000/1850) and another "Ruklamba" (1000/2000) in Attack Position [Notes 2] . Gansley's hand contains " Ashingray ", " Melchid the Four-Face Beast ", and a third copy of "Ruklamba".
 Duel continues next episode.

 Differences in adaptations 
 " Premature Burial " was given a redesign in the dub to smudge out the cross and the face of the buried person. 
 In the Japanese version, the scene shifts to the sky as  Yami Yugi  continues to scream when the  attack  of " Obnoxious Celtic Guardian " is reflected. 
 In the original Gansley explains how he summoned "Wall of Illusion", while in the dub he doesn't. 
 Cut from the dub are images of other, happy children with their parents in the orphanage playground when  Kaiba  and  Mokuba  see their past, and an image of the empty playground was replaced by one of Mokuba sitting alone on a swing. 
 When Seto challenged Gozaburo to a game of chess with the stakes set at adoption, in the dub, Seto blackmailed Gozaburo, threatening to tell the news reporters that Gozaburo was scared of a challenge from a kid. In the original version, Gozaburo saw Seto had a strong look in his eyes and accepted the challenge out of respect. 
 The death of Kaiba and Mokuba's parents are retconned in the dub. Originally, they were stated to have died in the flashbacks shown in the Duelist Kingdom arc, while in this episode they simply 'disappeared.' 
 In the English version's recap of the previous episode in which Yugi lets Yami take over, there is an error at the end in which a shot of normal Yugi is briefly shown. 
 Notes 
 
 ↑   Gansley  was neither shown declaring the effect of "Ipiria", nor shown drawing a card afterwards. However, the number of cards in his hand can be seen later, which indicates that the effect was used. 
 
 ↑   This is not explained in the dub
