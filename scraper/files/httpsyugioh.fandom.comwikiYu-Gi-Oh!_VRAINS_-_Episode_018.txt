He sends the Level 2 " Stack Reviver " from his hand to the GY and Special Summons "Bitrooper" in  Attack Position  (1500/2000). Playmaker Normal Summons " Cyberse Gadget " (1400/300). As it was Normal Summoned, Playmaker activates the effect of "Cyberse Gadget" to Special Summon a Level 2 or lower monster from his GY with its effects negated. He Special Summons "Stack Reviver" in Defense Position (100/600). Playmaker uses "Bitrooper", "Cyberse Gadget", and "Stack Reviver" to  Link Summon  " Decode Talker " (2300/LINK-3/↙↑↘) to the  Extra Monster Zone . As it was sent from the field to the GY, Playmaker activates the other effect of "Cyberse Gadget", which lets him Special Summon a " Gadget Token " (0/0) to the bottom-right Link Point of "Decode Talker". As it was used as a  material  for a Link Summon, Playmaker activates the effect of "Stack Reviver", which lets him Special Summon a a Level 4 or lower Cyberse monster that was used for that Link Summon from his GY in Defense Position. He Special Summons "Cyberse Gadget" (1400/300) to the bottom-left Link Point of "Decode Talker". "Decode Talker" gains 500 ATK for each monster it  points to  ("Decode Talker": 2300 → 3300 ATK).

Akira activates his face-down  Continuous Trap Card  " Lemoine Point ". As there is a "Tindangle" monster on the field, Playmaker cannot attack face-down monsters.

As "Hound" was destroyed by battle and sent to the GY, Akira activates its effect, allowing him to  flip  a face-down monster to face-up Defense Position. He flips his face-down " Tindangle Angel " to face-up Defense Position (500/1800). As "Angel" was flipped face-up, Akira activates its effect to Special Summon a  Flip monster  from his hand or GY in face-down Defense Position. He Special Summons "Hound" from his GY.

"Hound" gains ATK equal to the original ATK of "Angel", and "Angel" is flipped face-down ("Hound": 2500 → 3000 ATK). ("Decode Talker": 3600 → 2600 ATK; "Flame Administrator": 2000 → 1000 ATK).
 "Hound" attacks and destroys "Flame Administrator" (Playmaker: 4000 → 2000 LP) ("Decode Talker": 2600 → 1800 → 1300 → 2300 ATK). Akira Sets a card.
 Turn 4: Playmaker 
Playmaker Normal Summons " Balancer Lord " (1700/1200). Playmaker activates his face-down Continuous Trap Card " Limit Code ", placing 1  Limit Counter  on it for each Cyberse Link Monster in his GY, then Special Summoning a " Code Talker " monster from his  Extra Deck  and  equipping  "Limit Code" to that monster. "Limit Code" gains 1 counter for the "Flame Administrator" in his GY ("Limit Code" Limit Counters: 0 → 1), then Special Summons " Encode Talker " (2300/LINK-3/↑↓↘) to the Link Point of "Decode Talker" ("Decode Talker": 2300 → 2800 ATK) ("Decode Talker": 2800 → 1800 ATK; "Encode Talker": 2300 → 1300 ATK).
