 Summary 
 At  Heartland Tower ,  Nistro  and  Dextra  make a request to  Mr. Heartland  to allow them to enter the  World Duel Carnival . He accepts their request, but reminds them that they will have to get all of their  Heart Pieces  by the end of the day and their positions as coordinators will be removed. Nistro agrees to this, saying that he has a score to settle with someone. Mr. Heartland seems slightly suspicious, but decides to let them join anyway.
 While walking out, Dextra asks Nistro if he was referring to Yuma. Nistro responds that she was correct, thinking how Yuma defeated them both last time with his "Number". Dextra also realizes that Nistro is using a  different Deck  and asks him why he is not using  the Deck Mr. Heartland gave him . Nistro says that if he wants to defeat Yuma and  the Original "Number" , he would feel better knowing he did using his own personal Deck, also pointing out the fact that his Deck was better than his "Bounzer" Deck. They reach the balcony overlooking Heartland City. Dextra reminds Nistro of their time limit, and Nistro says that doesn't faze him.
 Meanwhile, at home, Yuma is told that  Roku  went back to the  Duel Sanctuary . Grandma  Haru  says Roku had a visitor there, but was nevertheless proud that Yuma chose to fight on. Yuma, however, is worried.  Kari  enters, agreeing with Haru and also telling her younger brother to stop whining. Just then,  Lillybot  bumps Kari and offers Yuma some food to eat. Yuma accepts happily,  with Haru cheering Yuma on, although Lillybot makes a pedantic comment regarding  Yuma's catchphrase , causing Yuma to react. 
 Yuma then leaves home, only to see  Tori ,  Cathy ,  Caswell ,  Bronk  and  Flip  already waiting for him. Yuma sees Caswell recovered from his trauma and wearing a cast on his arm. Caswell replies that he's "not 100%", but also remarks that no one pushes him around. Just, then, Flip interrupts Caswell by "pushing him around", informing Yuma that they'll be cheering him on. Then Cathy, pushes Flip "around" as well, just to affirm her support. Yuma happily shares a pal hug with Flip and Caswell. Bronk agrees with Tori that Yuma is stronger than he looks. 
 A while later, Yuma and his friends are at Heartland City, with Yuma proudly proclaiming his intent to win the World Duel Carnival, but he stops mid-sentence.  Astral  appears to Yuma from  his key , and agrees that Yuma is honoring his father. Flip asks Yuma how many Heart Pieces he has, and Yuma shows them off, replying that he has four. Bronk, Caswell and Flip agree to find another duelist for Yuma. Cathy notes that none of the bad duelists are still around. Bronk says they'll settle for average, and Yuma's friends rejoice, flattering Yuma himself. 
 While Bronk and Caswell search separately, Cathy has met up with her cats to help out with her search. Flip goes all the way to a back alley in his search for a duelist, when suddenly sees one being defeated. Flip finds out that Nistro was responsible for his defeat, and turns behind to run, only to see Dextra defeat her opponent right in front of him. Flip then hides away after seeing Nistro pick up a Heart Piece from his victim. Nistro meets Dextra again for a progress report. Both show to each other that they've already collected three Heart Pieces each, and agreeing that it was the right call for them to become competitors, rather than stay in the organising committee. This is heard by Flip. He, along with Nistro and Dextra, hear a commotion outside.  Nelson Andrews  has just defeated an unnamed competitor, attracting a crowd of fans while doing so. 
 Before Nelson can settle the crowd so that he can sign autographs, Nistro butts in with his challenge. Dextra, who has followed, warns Nistro not to get cocky, since Nelson does have three Heart Pieces as well. Flip has also followed but is hiding from a distance, and curses the fact that he didn't get an average duelist for Yuma to duel. The duel between Nistro and Nelson gets underway, with the crowd all putting their  AR gazers  on to watch. A short while later, Yuma, Tori, Bronk, Caswell and Cathy arrive to see the duel as well, having been informed by Flip.  Summer  and  Jen  then greet Tori, both saying that they came to watch The Sparrow. Yuma sees Nelson with his monsters out on the field already, but wonders why Nelson is dueling in costume, having remembered their last meeting in which Nelson admitted to not be a hero, just a middle-schooler in cosplay. 
 Yuma sees Nelson assemble his four signature monsters. Astral says it was an honor to face Nelson, having encountered those four monsters during his and Yuma's duel against Nelson. Nelson finally sees that Yuma has arrived to watch. However, Flip informs Yuma of what Nistro is playing, also adding that Nistro quit the organizing committee and entered as a contestant. Nistro also sees Yuma and warns that he's coming. Yuma only then notices that Nistro is playing monsters that are different to the ones he faced when he dueled Nistro. Astral adds that despite this, Nelson has the stronger monsters. Yuma and Astral then see Nistro use the effects of his three " Heroic Challenger - Spartan " to overpower Nelson's "D.D. Esper Star Sparrow" as it attacks, only for Nelson to stop his attack by activating a trap that lets him Tribute all his monsters for an 8000 ATK " D.D. Jet Iron ", which then attacks. Nistro activates a trap that enables him to survive the attack. Nistro then activates another trap that would finish Nelson off, but Nelson responds by having "D.D. Jet Iron" Tribute itself to revive the four  Sparrow Family  monsters. 
 When Nelson ends his turn, Yuma "commentates" his thoughts on the duel. Nistro Tribute Summons a monster and uses it to beat over " Beast-Warrior Puma ", causing Nelson to fall over due to the damage. His fans gasp in response. Yuma is excited at Nistro's comeback. Astral is more worried. When Nistro ends his turn, Bronk sees that Nelson's monsters aren't strong enough against the now 3700 ATK " Heroic Challenger - War Hammer ". Yuma agrees, but believes Nelson has a way out. Nelson himself is thinking how he would get out of this situation, by referring back to his duel against Yuma. 
 Nelson draws the card he needs. Using " Galaxy Queen's Light ", he modulates the levels of his three monsters, allowing him to make an Xyz play with all three of them. Yuma sees the 5000 ATK " Superdimensional Robot Galaxy Destroyer " appear on Nelson's field, and comments that he's upped his game. However, Yuma still doesn't know why Nelson dressed up to duel, having been told by Nelson himself that he was through with being The Sparrow. Nistro isn't scared because of his face-down card, which the watching Dextra believes to be " Sakuretsu Armor ". However, Nelson uses "Galaxy Destroyer's" ability to clear Nistro's back row. Yuma also notes that the card "War Hammer" equipped itself with is also destroyed, making its ATK become 2100 again. Nelson orders his "Galaxy Destroyer's" attack, which would have won the duel; however, Nistro survives after using " Heroic Challenger - Swordshield 's" hand trap effect. Nelson is still confident of winning the duel.
 Nistro draws " Heroic Challenger - Double Lance " and summons it. This brings out another copy of itself, allowing Nistro to  Xyz Summon  " Heroic Champion - Excalibur ". Astral sees "Excalibur" use its effect to double its ATK, but it's not enough to get over "Galaxy Destroyer". Nistro solves this by activating a spell to double "Excalibur's" ATK again. Nistro orders the winning move. As Nelson's Life Points fall to 0, his fans all cry out for him. Yuma rushes up to Nelson, calling him "Sparrow". Nelson gets up and brings his hair down, correcting Yuma by saying his name is Nelson. Yuma then asks Nelson why he was dueling in costume, and Nelson says it was according to plan. He thought he would be a hero if he dressed like a hero. Nistro then walks up to congratulate Nelson on his valiant effort before receiving the latter's Heart Piece as per the rules. Nistro then confirms to Yuma that he did indeed quit the organizing committee to participate as a contestant, and warns that he'll be awaiting Yuma in the finals. 
 As Nistro and Dextra walk away, Nelson assures Yuma. Nelson says that he was able to make it this far because of Yuma, and reminds him of their duel. As Yuma's friends run up to him as well, Nelson is able to tell them what he told Yuma. Yuma is surprised to hear that he inspired Nelson. Nelson replies that he may play a hero on television, but has his own hero in Yuma. With that, Nelson makes his leave as The Sparrow, to which his fans cheer. Yuma then reaches the logical conclusion that Nelson's fans are his fans, and "kattobingu's" one more time, to which Tori smiles. 
 
 Featured Duels 
 Nelson Andrews  vs. WDC Duelist 
 Duel  is shown from an unspecified  turn .  Nelson   controls  " Esper Star Sparrow " ( 10/3000/1500) in  Attack Position , while his opponent controls no cards and has 900  Life Points .
 Nelson's turn 
"Esper Star Sparrow"  attacks   directly  (Opponent: 900 → 0 LP).
 
 Nelson Andrews vs. Nistro 
         " Beast-Warrior Puma ", " Phoenix Beast Gairuda " and " Esper Star Sparrow ".     
 Duel  is shown from an unspecified  turn .  Nelson   controls  " Beast-Warrior Puma " ( 4/1600/1000), " Phoenix Beast Gairuda " ( 6/2500/1200) and " Esper Star Sparrow " ( 10/3000/1500), all in  Attack Position , one  Set  card and has 3400  Life Points .  Nistro  controls three " Heroic Challenger - Spartan " ( 4/1600/1000) in Attack Position, two Set cards and has 3000 Life Points.
 
           Nistro 's " Heroic Challenger - Spartans ".     
 Nelson's turn 
As Nelson controls "Beast-Warrior Puma", "Phoenix Beast Gairuda" and "Esper Star Sparrow", Nelson  Special Summons  " Ironhammer the Giant " ( 8/900/3500) from his  hand  in  Defense Position  via its own  effect . "Esper Star Sparrow"  attacks  a "Heroic Challenger - Spartan", but Nistro  activates  the effect of "Heroic Challenger - Spartan", increasing its  ATK  by the total ATK of all other  face-up  "Heroic Challenger - Spartan" he controls (attacked "Heroic Challenger - Spartan": 1600 → 4800 ATK). Nelson activates his  face-down  " Change to Jet Iron " to  Tribute  "Beast-Warrior Puma", "Phoenix Beast Gairuda", "Esper Star Sparrow" and "Ironhammer the Giant" and Special Summon " Dimensional Jet Iron " ( 10/0/0) in Attack Position. Due to the first effect of "Dimensional Jet Iron", it gains ATK equal to the combined ATK of the monsters Tributed for the activation of "Change to Jet Iron" ("Dimensional Jet Iron": 0 → 8000 ATK). 
 "Dimensional Jet Iron" attacks and  destroys  one of the "Heroic Challenger - Spartan" with 1600 ATK, but Nistro activates his face-down " Heroic Guard " to Tribute the "Heroic Challenger - Spartan" with 4800 ATK and gain Life Points equal to its ATK before the damage is subtracted (Nistro: 3000 → 7800 → 1400 LP). As a " Heroic Challenger "  monster  Nistro controls was  destroyed by battle  and  sent  to the  Graveyard , Nistro activates his face-down " Heroic Retribution Sword " to target "Dimensional Jet Iron" and equip "Heroic Retribution Sword" to his remaining "Heroic Challenger - Spartan". Nistro explains that should "Heroic Challenger - Spartan" battle "Dimensional Jet Iron", "Heroic Retribution Sword" will destroy "Dimensional Jet Iron" and Nelson will take  damage  equal to its ATK. 
 Nelson activates the second effect of "Dimensional Jet Iron", Tributing itself to to revive "Beast-Warrior Puma" ( 4/1600/1000), "Phoenix Beast Gairuda" ( 6/2500/1200), and "Esper Star Sparrow" ( 10/3000/1500) in Attack Position and "Ironhammer the Giant" ( 8/900/3500) in Defense Position. As "Dimensional Jet Iron" has  left the field , "Heroic Retribution Sword" is destroyed due to its last effect. As "Phoenix Beast Gairuda" was Special Summoned, Nelson activates its effect to  draw a card .
 Nistro's turn 
Nistro draws. He then Tributes "Heroic Challenger - Spartan" in order to  Tribute Summon  " Heroic Challenger - War Hammer " ( 6/2100/1300) in Attack Position. "Heroic Challenger - War Hammer" attacks and destroys "Beast-Warrior Puma" (Nelson: 3400 → 2900 LP). Since "Heroic Challenger - War Hammer" destroyed a monster by battle and sent it to the Graveyard, Nistro activates its effect to equip "Beast-Warrior Puma" to itself and increase its ATK by the ATK of "Beast-Warrior Puma" (Heroic Challenger - War Hammer": 2100 → 3700 ATK). Nistro Sets a card (" Sakuretsu Armor ").
 Nelson's turn 
 
                   Super Dimensional Robo - Galaxy Destroyer   The Summoning of " Superdimensional Robot Galaxy Destroyer "     
 Nelson draws " Galaxy Queen's Light " and subsequently activates it to target "Esper Star Sparrow" and change the  Levels  of "Phoenix Beast Gairuda" and "Ironhammer the Giant" to that of "Esper Star Sparrow" ("Phoenix Beast Gairuda":   6 → 10; "Ironhammer the Giant":   8 → 10). Nelson  overlays  "Esper Star Sparrow", "Phoenix Beast Gairuda", and "Ironhammer the Giant" in order to  Xyz Summon  " Superdimensional Robot Galaxy Destroyer " ( 10/5000/2000, ORU: 3) in Attack Position. 
 Nelson activates the effect of "Superdimensional Robot Galaxy Destroyer",  detaching  an  Overlay Unit  ("Superdimensional Robot Galaxy Destroyer": 3 → 2 ORU) to destroy all  Spell  and  Trap Cards  Nistro controls ("Heroic Challenger - War Hammer": 3700 → 2100 ATK). "Superdimensional Robot Galaxy Destroyer" attacks and destroys "Heroic Challenger - War Hammer". As he is about to take at least 2000 Battle Damage, Nistro activates the effect of " Heroic Challenger - Swordshield " to send it from his hand to to the Graveyard and make his Life Points become 100 instead (Nistro: 1400 → 100 LP).
 
                   Heroic Champion - Excalibur   The Summoning of " Heroic Champion - Excalibur "     
 Nistro's turn 
Nistro draws " Heroic Challenger - Double Lance " and subsequently Normal Summons it ( 4/1700/900) in Attack Position. Due to the effect of "Heroic Challenger - Double Lance", it is treated as two monsters for the Xyz Summon of a " Heroic Champion " monster. Nistro overlays "Heroic Challenger - Double Lance" with itself in order to Xyz Summon " Heroic Champion - Excalibur " ( 4/2000/2000, ORU: 1) in Attack Position. 
 
           "Excalibur" vs. "Galaxy Destroyer"     
 Nistro activates the effect of "Heroic Champion - Excalibur", detaching "Heroic Challenger - Double Lance" ("Excalibur": 1 → 0 ORU) in order to double the ATK of "Heroic Champion - Excalibur" ("Heroic Champion - Excalibur": 2000 → 4000 ATK) until the end of the  Battle Phase . Nistro activates " Heroic Chance " in order to double the ATK of "Heroic Champion - Excalibur" until the End Phase as his Life Points are 500 or less ("Heroic Champion - Excalibur": 4000 → 8000 ATK). "Heroic Champion - Excalibur" attacks and destroys "Superdimensional Robot Galaxy Destroyer" (Nelson: 2900 → 0 LP).
 
 Mistakes 
           Duel Disk on right arm     
           Duel Disk on left arm     
 After  Dextra  defeated her opponent, his  Duel Disk  first appears on his left arm, but is shown on his right arm later. 
 When  Nelson  ends the first  shown   turn , the  field  image showed it as Turn 01, which is impossible since  Nistro  would have had to have taken a turn already, as he had two  Set  cards. Nelson also  activated  a  Trap Card  on his turn, so it must have been at least the third turn. 
 In one instance in the English dub, Yuma referred to  Lilly  by her Japanese name of Obomi.
