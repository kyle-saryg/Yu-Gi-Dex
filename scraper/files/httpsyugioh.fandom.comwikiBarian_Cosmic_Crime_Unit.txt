      Barian Cosmic Crime Unit ID     
 The  Barian Cosmic Crime Unit , known as a  Barian's Guardian  or  Varian's Guardian  in the Japanese version, is a protector of the  Barian World  in the  Yu-Gi-Oh! ZEXAL  anime. They act as the law enforcement for the Barian World. [1]   Ray Shadows  claimed himself as one of them, and was tasked with a mission to defeat the evil  Barians  (in the dub, his job was to find Barian criminals hiding among the denizens of the Human World). Later on, Ray made  Yuma Tsukumo  a "Barian's Guardian subordinate" ("Barian Cosmic Crime Unit sidekick" in the dub) and gave him a badge to verify the position. Yuma mistakenly called this group "Cardian" instead of "Guardian". [2]  However, the group was revealed to be a fictional position created by Vector in order to deceive Yuma. [3]
