 In  episode 73 ,  Sartorius  uses this card during his duel against  Tyranno Hassleberry . After " Dark Tyranno " and " Arcana Force VII - The Chariot " are destroyed by the effect of " Suit of Sword X ", Sartorius activates this card, which rotates upon activation. This card lands upside down, so Hassleberry takes damage equal to the combined ATK of his destroyed monsters.
