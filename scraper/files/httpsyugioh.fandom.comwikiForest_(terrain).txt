      The Forest terrain     
 Forest  is a terrain usually affecting  Beast ,  Beast-Warrior ,  Insect  and  Plant - Type  monsters.
 In the  manga  and  anime , the field available for use in the  Duelist Kingdom  preliminaries when playing in forest regions. It powered up affected monsters  ATK  and  DEF  by 30%.  Weevil Underwood  used this to power up his Insect-Type monsters against  Yami Yugi .
 In early video games, the field can be changed to Forest by activating " Forest ", which grants the  ATK  and  DEF  changing effects of "Forest" to the affected area.
 In  Yu-Gi-Oh! R , a forest could be created using " Deep Forest ". Its effect allowed affected Level 4 or lower monsters to hide in the forest.
