 Summary 
 Intro 
         The track used for the Turbo Duel.     
 In the year 20XX,  Yusei Fudo  and  Sect Ijuin  prepare to  Turbo Duel  along the pipes of a  large factory . Surrounding platforms are occupied by a large audience cheering them on.
 Sect believes that today will bring him victory. However the crowd generally think Yusei will win and doubt Sect received rare cards from the  Skeleton Knight . Sect notices the audience is teasing him, but Yusei advises him to take no notice.
 
 The Duel 
 The Duel starts and both duelists race along the pipes. Sect is impressed with the speed of Yusei's  Duel Runner .
 Yusei goes first and Summons " Junk Blader ". He  equips  it with " Rusted Blade - Rust Edge ", raising its  ATK  to 2600. Sect is surprised to see a monster with such high  ATK  Summoned on the first turn. Yusei  Sets  1 card in the  Spell & Trap Card Zone  and ends his turn.
 A member of the audience yells at Sect, asking if he thinks he stands and chance against Yusei and suggests that he give up. Sect starts to worry, but Yusei shouts back some encouraging words and Sect gets a grip.
 Sect begins his turn. He Summons " Armored Bee " and uses its effect, "Poison Needle". It fires its stinger at "Junk Blader", cutting its ATK in half.
 "Armored Bee", with 1600  ATK  attacks " Junk Blader ", whose ATK is now at 1300. "Armored Bee" tears "Junk Blader" in two, dropping Yusei's  Life Points  to 3700. However the effect of " Rusted Blade - Rust Edge " activates and the sword is sent spinning in Sect's direction. It hits him, dropping his Life Points to 3200.
 Yusei activates " Pride of the Warrior " reviving " Junk Blader " and protecting him from being destroyed this turn. Much to Yusei's surprise, Sect claims to have foreseen that. He plays " Turf ",  Releasing  "Armored Bee" and  Special Summoning  " Great Poseidon Beetle " from his  hand .
 Still in his  Battle Phase , Sect has "Great Poseidon Beetle" attack "Junk Blader" with its "Trident Spiral" attack. "Pride of the Warrior" keeps "Junk Blader" from being destroyed, but "Poseidon's" effect allows it to attack an Attack Position monster up to 3 times per turn. After the barrage of attacks Yusei's Life Points are left at 1600.
 The impact sends Yusei swerving out of control, allowing Sect to pass him. The audience are astonished and Yusei compliments Sect on his move, but believes he will still win the Duel. The audience start to cheer on Sect now, much to both Sect and Yusei's pleasure.
 Yusei begins his turn and draws " Quick Spanite ". He Summons it and Sect worries, realizing it's a  Tuner Monster . Yusei tunes "Quick Spanite", who's  Level  3 with " Junk Blader ", who's  Level  4 to  Synchro Summon  " Lightning Warrior ".
 Sect points out that "Great Poseidon Beetle" has more  ATK , but Yusei smiles and explains the effect of "Quick Spanite"; since it was sent to the  Graveyard  for a Synchro Summon, it can decrease the ATK of an opponent's monster by 500. The hologram of "Quick Spanite" reappears. Its head detaches and launches into "Great Poseidon Beetle", lowering its ATK to 2000.
 Yusei next plays " Arms Regeneration ", equipping the " Rusted Blade - Rust Edge " that was in his Graveyard to "Lightning Warrior", raising its ATK to 3200. Sect starts to panic, but Yusei continues. He plays " Overflowing Treasure ", which gives "Lightning Warrior" a further 500 ATK for each card in both players'  hands . Its ATK soars up to 5200.
 Yusei declares that he's attacking "Great Poseidon Beetle" with "Lightning Warrior". He speeds-up, catching up to Sect before the monsters battle. Sect takes 3200  Battle Damage , enough to drop his Life Points to 0. As his Life Points lower, he is sent flying from his Duel Runner.
 
 Aftermath 
 Sect lies on the ground, feeling bad for losing to Yusei again. Yusei walks over and helps him up, complimenting him on a great Turbo Duel. He tells Sect that he's improved and accepts him as a rival. Sect's eyes start to flood with tears and he shakes Yusei's hand.
 Sect's spirits rise and he announces that he'll get back at Yusei. He gets up on top of a tank and holds two cards up to the sunset. He clasps them together and prays that he'll be given rare cards to beat Yusei. Puzzled, Yusei asks somebody nearby what Sect is doing. The man is surprised that Yusei doesn't know of the urban legend; when a duelist clasps their cards together at sunset, the  Skeleton Knight  appears to give them rare cards. Yusei smiles and looks up at Sect.
 
         The Skeleton Knight on the altar.     
 Suddenly the earth starts to shake. People suspect that the factory may be in use, but this can't be as it's been closed. Yusei notices something happening to Sect and dashes over to check it out. Sect is pulled on top of a pyramid-shaped structure, which Yusei is certain was not there before. Everyone else starts to run away. The platform at the top of the structure resembles  an altar  as fire shoots from the four vertical pipes in the corners.
 The Skeleton Knight from the legend appears on the altar, mounted on a skeleton horse and holding Sect at the end of his lance. He states that it's ridiculous that such a loser asked him for a wish, and drops Sect from the lance. Yusei demands that the Skeleton Knight hand back Sect. However the knight holds up a  Duel Disk  and challenges Yusei to a Duel.

Yusei activates " Arms Regeneration ", equipping "Rusted Blade - Rust Edge" from his Graveyard to "Lightning Warrior", which increases its ATK by 800 (2400 → 3200).
