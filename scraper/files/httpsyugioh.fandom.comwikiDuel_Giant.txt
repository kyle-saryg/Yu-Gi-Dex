 History 
 To create the Giant, Beauregard played the part of the Duelist, disguised behind an enormous cloak made of male  Obelisk Blue  uniforms and a pair of reflective sunglasses. Meanwhile Brier fed him instructions via a radio headset from a hiding spot nearby, taking advantage of his small size to hide under the cover of darkness. The "Giant" persona helped Brier and Beauregard overcome their respective difficulties, taking advantage of their untapped potential. When Beauregard  Dueled  in his place, Brier could show all his potential despite his stage fright. Plus, as they operated under the cover of darkness, Beauregard could duel without other people being afraid of his large size. The two made use of the "Duel Giant" persona to take revenge on  Obelisk Blue  students who bullied the pair, terrorizing the bullies into Duels using  the forbidden Ante rule . However, their string of card thefts eventually caught the attention of  Dr. Crowler , who sent  Jaden Yuki  to defeat the Giant (in order to expel him). During their duel, a stray attack by " Elemental HERO Rampart Blaster " threw off Beauregard's costume, exposing the duo's trick. Ultimately, Jaden convinced the pair to battle him out in the open in exchange for not turning them in, and the pair returned the stolen cards [1] .
 
 Decks 
 Anime 
 As the Duel Giant, Brier and Beauregard use a  Goblin  Deck , which includes high- ATK  strength creatures such as " Giant Orc " that can have its drawback removed by the  Union Monster  " Second Goblin ". The deck reflected the relationship between Beauregard and Brier themselves, a small brainy character and big brawny one covering one another's weaknesses.
