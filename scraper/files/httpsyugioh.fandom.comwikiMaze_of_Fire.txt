 Main article:  Hanasaki's vigils 
 Hanasaki's father  paid a trio of delinquents to stage crimes and allow  Tomoya Hanasaki  to break them up, while he dressed as  Zombire  and thought he was a superhero. However while pretending to have kidnapped  Yugi Mutou , the delinquents demanded more money than Hanasaki's father could pay and threatened to beat-up Hanasaki if he did not pay.
 As Hanasaki got beaten-up by the delinquents, who told they had been paid the whole time,  Dark Yugi  and Hanasaki's father arrived. Dark Yugi broke up the fight by challenging the delinquents to a game.
 
 The game 
 One of the delinquents  threw his cigarette on the ground, next to a spray paint can they had used to graffiti tag the area and asked if Dark Yugi thought he could take them on. Dark Yugi picked up the spray can and began to run, while the delinquents chased him with knives.
 Hanasaki's father tried to take Hanasaki away while the delinquents were distracted by Dark Yugi, but Hanasaki refused to run away, while Yugi was in danger.
 Dark Yugi sprayed lines on the ground, while the delinquents chased him. Eventually he was cornered, but he directed their attention to the paint he had sprayed and the cigarette butt, which was being used as a fuse. As the cigarette burned out, its fire hit the paint, setting it all alight.
 The delinquents were separated from Dark Yugi, as they got trapped in his "Maze of Fire". With the legs of their pants on fire, the three of them ran out of the yard, leaping into the canal.
 
 Aftermath 
 Hanasaki apologized to Dark Yugi and thought that he had been foolish for thinking he could be a super hero, but Dark Yugi still insisted that he could. Meanwhile Hanasaki's father realized that he was wrong and the true hero's face had been behind the mask; the face that got bruised defending its friend.
