 Prior Events 
 Noah Kaiba  calls in a meeting with  Gansley ,  Crump ,  Johnson  and  Leichter  about how disappointed he is.  Nezbitt , in  Tristan Taylor 's body informs Noah he is ready to leave but Noah instructs them to go after  Yugi Muto  and his friends, and warns them that this will be their final chance.
 As  Seto Kaiba  breaks off from the group to rescue  Mokuba Kaiba , Yugi and his friends try to follow. Soon they are stopped by Nezbitt, in Tristan's body, only now Nezbitt is not alone as all of  The Big Five  are now inhabiting Tristan's body and they challenge Yugi to a duel. If he wins, they get Tristan's body back, but if he loses, the bodies of Yugi and his friends all belong to the Big Five. Joey interjects saying five against one is not fair and offers to join. While initally the Big Five refuse, Johnson agrees to the terms on the condition that The Big Five start with double the amount of Life Points while the two duelists only have the normal amount.
 The duel commences.

 Featured Duel: Yami Yugi + Joey Wheeler vs. The Big Five 
 Turn 1: The Big Five (Gansley) 
 Gansley  goes first and brings out his Deck Master " Deepsea Warrior ". Gansley draws "The Legendary Fisherman". He then  activates  " A Legendary Ocean ". Now all WATER monsters on the field and in both players' hands have their levels reduced by one and in addition all WATER monsters gain 200 ATK and DEF. He then  Normal Summons  " The Legendary Fisherman " ( ★   4  → 3/ 1850 / 1600 ) in  Attack Position . As the name of "A Legendary Ocean" is treated as " Umi ", "The Legendary Fisherman" cannot be attacked and is unaffected by Magic Cards.
 Turn 2: Joey 
 Joey  draws " Alligator's Sword " and subsequently Normal Summons it (1500/1200) in  Defense Position .
 Turn 3: Yami 
 Yami Yugi  draws " Gazelle the King of Mythical Beasts " and subsequently Normal Summons it (1500/1200) in Defense Position.
 Turn 4: The Big Five (Crump) 
At this point, Crump takes over for Gansley. As such, the Deck Master is changed from "Deepsea Warrior" to " Nightmare Penguin ". Crump draws. Due to the Deck Master Ability of Nightmare Penguin, the ATK of "The Legendary Fisherman" rises by 200 ("The Legendary Fisherman": 1850 → 2050/1600) as it's a WATER monster. "The Legendary Fisherman"  attacks  and  destroys  "Gazelle".  Crump  then Normal Summons " Catapult Turtle " (1000 → 1400/2000 → 2200;   5 → 4) in Defense Position.
 Turn 5: Joey 
Joey draws " Kunai with Chain " and subsequently  Sets  it. Joey's hand contains " Fairy Box ", " Burning Soul Sword ", " Polymerization ", " Double Snare ", and "Cyber Harpie". Joey Normal Summons " Cyber Harpie " (1800/1300) in Attack Position and switches "Alligator's Sword" to Attack Position.
 Turn 6: Yami 
Yami Yugi's hand contains " Buster Blader ", " Alpha the Magnet Warrior ", " Black Luster Ritual ", " Card Destruction ", and " Kuriboh ". Yami Yugi draws " Mystical Elf " and subsequently Normal Summons it (800/2000) in Defense Position.
 Turn 7: The Big Five (Crump)

Crump Sets a  monster  (" Magician of Faith ").
 Turn 8: Joey 
Joey draws " Harpie's Feather Duster " and subsequently activates it to destroy "A Legendary Ocean" ("Catapult Turtle" 1400 → 1200/2200 → 2000;   4 → 5).

 Crump's hand contains " Monster Reborn ", " Premature Burial ", "Polymerization", " Driving Snow ", and "A Legendary Ocean". Crump plans to activate "A Legendary Ocean" next turn as well as use "Monster Reborn" to revive "The Legendary Fisherman" which will rebuild the Big Five's previous combo.
 Turn 9: Yami 
Yami Yugi draws. He then Normal Summons " Kuriboh " (300/200) in Defense Position. He then activates " Card Destruction " to force all players to  discard  their hand and  draw  the same amount of cards they discarded.

 Turn 10: The Big Five (Johnson) 
Johnson has just taken over for Crump. As such, the Deck Master again changes from "Nightmare Penguin" to  Judge Man . As The Big Five switched their Deck Master, the  ATK  of " Catapult Turtle " decreases ("Catapult Turtle": 1200 → 1000/2000). Johnson draws. He then  activates  the  Deck Master ability  of " Judge Man ", Clear the Curtroom, to  pay  1000  Life Points  (The Big Five 8000 → 7000),  destroy  all monsters that Yami Yugi and Joey control, and inflict 500 damage to them for each of their destroyed monsters (Yami Yugi 4000 → 3000; Joey 4000 → 3000). 
 Johnson then  Normal Summons  " Hysteric Angel " (1800/600) in  Attack Position . "Hysteric Angel" attacks Joey directly (Joey 3000 → 1200).

He then activates " Heavy Storm " to destroy all Magic and Trap Cards on the field which includes Yami Yugi's face-down card, "Mirror Force" ("Altar of Mist" is not destroyed by "Heavy Storm" as mentioned above). Since Nezbitt activated a Magic Card, the second effect of "Des Volstgalph" activates, increasing its ATK by 200 until the end of the turn ("Des Volstgalph": 2200 → 2400/1700), however Nezbitt doesn't notice this yet. 
 "Machine King" attacks "Des Volstgalph", but Yami Yugi reveals at this point that "Des Volstgalph" gained 200 more ATK when Nezbitt activated "Heavy Storm". "Des Volstgalph" destroys "Machine King" (The Big Five 7000 → 6900).

Since "Five-Headed Dragon" was Ritual Summoned, its first effect activates, destroying all cards on Yami Yugi and Joey's side of the field. Leichter explains that due to the last two effects of "Five-Headed Dragon", it can't  attack  on the turn it's Ritual Summoned and it cannot be destroyed in battle by any  monsters  except  LIGHT  monsters.
