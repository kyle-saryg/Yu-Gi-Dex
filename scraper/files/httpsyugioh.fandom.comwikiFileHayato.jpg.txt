 History 
 Industrial Illusions is the company that makes  Duel Monsters  and publishes  Dungeon Dice Monsters  worldwide. The company is run by the Duel Monsters game's creator  Maximillion Pegasus . The company supplies Duel Monsters expansion data to  KaibaCorp . for their  Solid Vision  holograms (explained in  Yu-Gi-Oh! R ). He and  Seto Kaiba  were once old friends when Pegasus was still an active duelist. But in the  Duelist Kingdom  arc Pegasus teamed with Kaiba's old executives, the Big Five, in order to take over KaibaCorp and use the Solid Vision technology to simulate his lover,  Cecelia Pegasus ' existence. (In the English dub version, he wanted to use KaibaCorp's technology in combination with the seven  Millennium Items  to revive his deceased wife.)
 In the manga, after Pegasus lost to  Dark Yugi  and then died at the hands of  Dark Bakura , his adoptive son  Yako Tenma  took over as president of the company. Yako, in his attempt for revenge, took over KaibaCorp, in attempt to revive Pegasus via  Project R.A. , which ultimately failed.
 
       Inside the Building     
 In the anime-only Doma arc Pegasus bought over half of Seto's company but agreed to stop if Kaiba would duel him. Kaiba agrees and flies to Duelist Kingdom and duels him. However, it is later revealed Pegasus was defeated in a duel by  Mai Valentine , and  Alister  was dueling him instead. At the end of the Doma Arc he is freed from captivity along with the rest of  Dartz 's prisoners.
 In  Yu-Gi-Oh! GX , Industrial Illusions was featured.  Chumley Huffington  ends up accepting a job offer from Maximillion Pegasus.
