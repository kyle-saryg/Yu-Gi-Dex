 Biography 
 Childhood 
 Shizuka and Jonouchi were separated at a young age due to their parents' divorce, and Shizuka went to live with her mother who was working as a nurse while Jonouchi with his father who was an alcoholic gambler.
 
 Duelist Kingdom 
 Jonouchi  receives a video tape from Shizuka. In it, she tells him that time is running out for her because she needs an operation to repair her eyesight or else she will go blind. The operation, however, is very expensive and to pay for it, Jonouchi needs to win the three hundred-thousand dollar prize at the  Duelist Kingdom  tournament. Despite not having an invitation, Jonouchi is allowed on the ship after Yugi gives him one of his  Star Chips . Yugi also gives him the three hundred-thousand dollars he won to Jonouchi so he can pay for Shizuka's eye operation.
 
 Battle City 
 After her operation,  Battle City  begins. Shizuka spends most of the tournament in the  hospital  recovering with  Honda  and  Ryuji  taking care of her. She finally removes the bandages around her eyes and sees clearly for the first time when the entire gang is sent to the  Domino Pier . Shizuka is present, but Jonouchi is rescued by  Kaiba , who simply drops the key needed into the water, after the Duel between a brainwashed Jonouchi and Yugi. Afterwards, she hangs out with the gang for the finals and becomes friends with  Mai Kujaku  and  Anzu Mazaki , who both treat her like a younger sister.
 
 Battle City Finals 
 Shizuka was in charge of taking care of Mai, who was unconscious after losing to  Dark Marik . During Jonouchi's Duel, he fainted and lost the Duel. Unlike in the Duel Monsters anime, she is present for the four way duel, Jounochi's duel with Marik, and Yami Yugi's duel with Marik. When the tournament ended, she went back to Japan with Jounochi.
