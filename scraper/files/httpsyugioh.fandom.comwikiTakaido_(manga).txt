 Biography 
 Duelist Kingdom 
 In the  Duelist Kingdom  tournament, they meet up  Bandit Keith , who agrees coach them through the tournament so all four of them will advance to Pegasus' castle. While helping them win Duels the first day of the tournament, Keith secretly intends to use them for their  Star Chips . 
 When  Keith  finds out about  Yugi Mutou ,  Katsuya Jonouchi , and the rest of the gang, they believe they will get in their way, and seek to eliminate them. When Jonouchi runs away from the group to urinate,  Satake  beats him unconscious and he wakes up in cave with a  Battle Box , complete with a  Graveyard Field .  Ghost Kozuka  challenges Jonouchi to a  Duel  that he tricks him into thinking he must accept; however,  Jonouchi  wins the  Duel . 
 Bandit Keith then locks the gang in, and turns on his own companions. Since Satake and Takaido had five Star Chips each, Bandit Keith takes them from them (along with a Dueling Gauntlet) after beating up Kozuka for losing. With those ten Star Chips, he becomes the first to qualify for the finals.
