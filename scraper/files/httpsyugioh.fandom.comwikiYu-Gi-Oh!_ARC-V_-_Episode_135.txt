 Featured Duel: Yuya Sakaki vs. Yuri 
 Duel continues from the previous episode . 
 Yuri  controls " Starving Venom Fusion Dragon ", " Clear Wing Synchro Dragon " and " Dark Rebellion Xyz Dragon " via the effect of " Dragonvine " and one card in his hand.  Yuya  controls " Odd-Eyes Pendulum Dragon ", face-up " Starlight Force " and " Stargazer Magician " (   1) and " Timegazer Magician " (   8) in his Pendulum Zones, with three cards in his hand. It is currently Yuya's turn.
 Turn 4: Yuya 
Yuya's hand contains " Break Away ", " Performapal Flatrat " and " Smile World ". Yuya  Sets  a card. At the  End Phase , "Starlight Force" is  destroyed  since the combined  Levels  of all monsters on Yuya's field is less than the combined Levels of all monsters on Yuri's field ("Starving Venom":   5 →   8; "Clear Wing":   5 →   7). 
 Turn 5: Yuri 
"Starving Venom"  attacks  and destroys "Odd-Eyes" (Yuya: 3400 → 3100 LP). "Clear Wing" attacks  directly . Yuya finds and activates the  Action Card  " Evasion ", but Yuri finds and activates the Action Card " No Action " to negate the activation of an Action Spell and destroy it. The attack of "Clear Wing" continues (Yuya: 3100 → 600 LP). "Dark Rebellion" attacks directly. Yuya finds the Action Card " Miracle ". He attempts to activate his  face-down  "Break Away", which allows him to send a  Spell Card  from his hand to the Graveyard to end the  Battle Phase  and negate the effects of all face-up monsters on the field until the end of the turn. Yuri finds and activates the Action Card " Action Crush ", which destroys all Action Cards in each player's hand that were added this turn. "Miracle" is destroyed, so Yuya sends "Smile World" from his hand to the Graveyard to activate "Break Away" instead. Yuri Sets two cards.
 Turn 6: Yuya 
Yuya draws " Performapal Trap Mimic ". He  Pendulum Summons  "Trap Mimic" (400/200) and "Performapal Flatrat" (500/???) from his hand and "Odd-Eyes" (2500/2000) from his Extra Deck, all in Attack Position. Yuya activates the effect of "Trap Mimic" to destroy a  Trap Card  his opponent controls, copy its effects, then place it in his  Spell & Trap Zone  as a  Continuous Trap Card . Yuya destroys "Dragonvine". The acquired effect of "Dragonvine" allows Yuya to gain control of a Dragon-Type monster on the field, so Yuya gains control of "Clear Wing". As the original "Dragonvine"  left the field , "Dark Rebellion" returns to Yuya's control. Yuri activates his face-down " Predaplant Reborn ", which lets him  Special Summon  a " Predaplant " monster from his Graveyard. Yuri Special Summons " Predaplant Stapeliaworm " (100/2000). As a monster was Special Summoned, Yuya activates the effect of "Flatrat", which lets him change that monster's Level to that of "Flatrat" ("Stapeliaworm":   4 →   5).
 Yuya activates the effect of "Dark Rebellion",  detaching  an  Overlay Unit  to halve the ATK of a monster Yuri controls and increase the ATK of "Dark Rebellion" by the lost ATK. He targets "Starving Venom". As an effect that changes ATK was activated, Yuri activates the effect of "Stapeliaworm",  negating  the activation and destroying "Dark Rebellion". As a Level 5 or higher monster activated its effect, Yuya activates the effect of "Clear Wing", negating that effect, destroying that monster, and increasing the ATK of "Clear Wing" by the destroyed monster's ATK until the end of the turn ("Clear Wing" 2500 → 2600). The effect of "Dark Rebellion"  resolves  ("Dark Rebellion" 2500 → 3900, "Starving Venom" 2800 → 1400). Yuya activates the effect of "Dark Rebellion" on "Starving Venom" again ("Dark Rebellion" 3900 → 4600) ("Starving Venom" 1400 → 700). Yuri activates his face-down " Ridiculing World ", which increases the ATK of all monsters Yuya controls by 100, but prevents all monsters whose ATK is higher than their  original ATK  from attacking this turn. ("Dark Rebellion": 4600 → 4700, "Clear Wing": 2600 → 2700, "Odd-Eyes": 2500 → 2600)
 As the ATK of monsters changed, Yuya activates the effect of "Flatrat",  Tributing  it to change the ATK of a monster he controls to its original ATK. Yuya chooses "Odd-Eyes". "Odd-Eyes" attacks and destroys "Starving Venom". As "Odd-Eyes"  battled  a Level 5 or higher monster, its effect doubles the  battle damage  dealt to Yuri (Yuri 3600 → 0).

 Error 
 In the previous episode, the  Trap Card  in  Yuya 's  hand  was in the middle and the  Monster Card  was on the left side, but in this episode, these two cards have swapped position. 
 In the dub, Yuri (1) refers to his trap "Predaplant Reborn" as "Predator Plant Reborn" and then (2) explains that its effect allows him to resurrect a "Predator Plant".
