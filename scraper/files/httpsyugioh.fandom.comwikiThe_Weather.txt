 Playing style 
 The archetype's main playing style revolves around using the "The Weather […] Canvas" Continuous Spells/Traps to grant additional effects to the "The Weather" Main Deck monsters, according to their position on the Main Monster Zones. Those effects are activated by  banishing  themselves, and if they do so, they can be Special Summoned back during the next Standby Phase. Most of their monsters also has the capability to place more "The Weather […] Canvas" Spells/Traps on the field, from various places. Because of this, careful consideration, planning ahead and advanced strategical moves are extremely important in order to maximize each of the card's output and adapt at almost every situation.
 All of the effects granted by their Spells/Traps are  Quick Effects , except that of " Thundery Canvas ," making them effectively able to dodge most targeting effects. " The Weather Painter Aurora ", in turn, also protects their Spells/Traps from being targeted or destroyed by your opponent, rendering them immune to most forms of backrow removal. This trait also makes them a bit resistant against most negation effects.
 Some of their monsters like " The Weather Painter Thunder " and " The Weather Painter Sun " can also use any Continuous Spell/Trap for their effects, thus they also have synergy with  floodgate  and  lockdown  cards like " Anti-Spell Fragrance " or " Skill Drain ". " The Weather Painter Cloud " can also helps recovering their Spell/Traps from the Graveyard, allowing them to use cards like " Magic Planter " and turn it into more advantage instead of an even trade.
 Due to the deck’s unique mechanic and play style, they can get around several popular forms of negation and floodgates, and can even use them to their advantage. Since the monsters “place” their Canvas cards on the field, it does not count as searching or activating, therefore cards like “ Ash Blossom & Joyous Spring ”, “ Anti-Spell Fragrance ”, and “ Imperial Order ” can’t counter them. Since the monsters also don’t activate their own effects and merely gain effects from the Canvas cards in their adjacent columns, then effect negation cards like “ Skill Drain ” and “ Lose 1 Turn ” do not affect them. The monsters also banish as a cost so they’ll always avoid the targeting negation of cards like “ Effect Veiler ” and “ Infinite Impermanence ”, since the monsters will no longer be on the field when they’re activated. 
 Because of the deck’s banishing mechanic, it can safely play around cards like “ Macro Cosmos ” and “ Dimensional Fissure ”, but one must be wary that these cards may also conflict with cards like “ The Weather Painter Sun ”. Since the deck also rarely uses the extra deck outside of their boss monster “ The Weather Painter Rainbow ”, a tech choice of “ Pot of Extravagance ” can help with consistency.

 Mekk-Knight Weather Painters 
 As The Weather cards specialize in placing Spell/Trap cards on the field and have their effects work mechanically on columns on the field, there is synergy with the  Mekk-Knights , and assisting the Special Summoning of the Mekk-Knights by placing Spell/Trap cards in a column with other cards.

 Weaknesses 
 Due to the reliance on banishing themselves as cost for their effects, "The Weather" Decks are vulnerable to cards like " Imperial Iron Wall ", " Chaos Hunter ", and " Artifact Lancea ". " Gozen Match " can also cripple their ability to Summon more monsters onto the field, forcing them to rely on just one monster to maintain their position.
 Despite their heavy reliance on banishing, they're also susceptible to banishment themselves. Mass-banishing effects of cards like " Arkbrave Dragon " and " Evenly Matched " are especially dangerous, rendering cards like " The Weather Painter Cloud " useless, while also bypassing the protection granted by " The Weather Painter Aurora ". Banishment also puts their monsters out of reach from " The Weather Sunny Canvas ", and renders " The Weather Painter Sun " unable to revive itself.
 Much like other boss monsters in the game, cards like " Solemn Warning " and " Black Horn of Heaven " can stop the Summoning of "Rainbow", while the " Kaijus " and " Chimeratech Megafleet Dragon " can effortlessly remove her from the field (assuming the Main Monster Zones aren't full).
 Cards that prevent monster effects, such as " Mystic Mine ", " Majesty's Fiend ", and " Skill Drain ", will shut this Deck down since the monsters are actually activating the effects bestowed upon them by the Spells/Traps.
 
 Trivia 
 This archetype can be considered as an antithesis to the " Magical Musket " archetype, in many ways:
 "Magical Musket" focuses on using their Spell/Traps to fuel their monster effects, while this archetype uses their monsters to fuel their Spell/Traps, instead. 
 "Magical Musket" has 2 Spells and 4 Traps, while this archetype has 4 Spells and 2 Traps. 
 "Magical Musket" are all  Fiend , while this archetype is all  Fairy . 
 " Magical Musket Mastermind Zakiel " is a  Main Deck  monster, while " The Weather Painter Rainbow " is an  Extra Deck  monster. 
 " Magical Musket - Fiendish Deal " protects "Magical Musket" monsters, while " The Weather Painter Aurora " protects this archetype's Spells/Traps. 
 Both debuts in  Deck Build Pack: Spirit Warriors , and both are  column -based archetypes. 
 This archetype also share some traits with the " Mekk-Knight " archetype:
 Both archetypes are based around seven colors of rainbow. 
 Both archetypes' strategies are also column-based. 
 Both " The Weather Painter Rainbow " and " Mekk-Knight Spectrum Supreme " has the exact same Link Arrows, also both are Link-3 monsters.
