 Biography 
 Life 
       Cyndia meets  Pegasus     
 Around the age of 10, while attending a social function, Cyndia met  Pegasus , the son of one of her parents' friends. The two fell in love and spent a lot of time together. They would often talk about their dreams and swore to spend their lives together. [1] 
 Shortly after Pegasus turned 17, Cyndia got sick and died also at the age of 17, causing Pegasus to fall into a state of depression. [1] 
 
 
 Post Death 
       The apparition of Cyndia, created by the  Millennium Eye     
 Unable to overcome Cyndia's death, Pegasus became interested in the ancient Egyptian beliefs in life after death and traveled to Egypt to learn more. In Egypt Pegasus was tested for worthiness of the  Millennium Eye . Pegasus passed the test, during which he was embraced by an apparition of Cyndia. [1] 
 At some point, Pegasus painted a portrait of Cyndia, which he hung in  his castle , but did not like to talk about it. [2] 
 Pegasus grew fond of the  Solid Vision  technology  KaibaCorp  was developing to make realistic renderings of  Duel Monsters  cards. He planned on taking over KaibaCorp, so he could use this technology to create a lifelike projection of Cyndia. He designed  a card, depicting Cyndia  for this purpose. [3] 
 After Pegasus' murder,  Yako Tenma  found the "Cyndia" card, with Pegasus' blood splattered on it. [4]
