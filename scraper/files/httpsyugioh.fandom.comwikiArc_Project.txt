 The  Arc Project , known as " Aquaria Project " or alternatively translated as " Arc-Area Project " (アークエリア・プロジェクト  Ākueria Purojekuto ) in the Japanese version is the project devised by  Leo Akaba  and the goal of  Duel Academy , which involves the using the power of  Fusion  to merge the  Four Dimensions  and revert the worlds to their original state: the  United World . According to Duel Academy's prominent military officers and lower ranking soldiers, this would establish a utopia where all people from the various dimensions can live in peace. [1] [2] [3] 
 
 Overview 
 This project is shown to require  Zuzu  and  her   dimensional   counterparts [4] , as well as invading the  Xyz  and  Synchro Dimensions [5]  and having  their people sealed into cards  in order to bring them back to Duel Academy and use their life force to power the project. [3]  According to  Declan Akaba ,  Yuya   and   his   counterparts  are also important. [6] 
 When people are turned into cards, the process turns their natural energy, their bodies and souls, into condensed versions, cards, and are all sent without fail to Duel Academy (except for non-unprecedented card transformations like Dennis' or the carded LID students). The project is a means to complete  Revival Zero , which requires the gathering of natural energy, the people turned into condensed card versions of themselves, as energy source for  ARC-V .
 Leo, finding the  Lancers  (led by his son Declan) and Yuya as threat to his Arc Project, decided to send the  Tyler   sisters  to the Xyz Dimension in order to eliminate them [2]  as well as the  Obelisk Force  as insurance. [7] 
 Ultimately as  Declan Akaba  noted the Arc Project inadvertently ended up causing  Z-ARC 's resurrection. [8]  The newly resuscitated Supreme King Dragon proclaimed he would fulfill his original ambition to devastate the dimensions as revenge for humankind goading him into psychosis and the fear of being defeated. [9] [10] 
 However, the Lancers and  Ray Akaba 's opposition towards him prevented this outcome and caused the  Standard Dimension 's rebirth as the  "Pendulum Dimension" , while  Riley Akaba  sealed Z-ARC's soul into herself but at the cost of returning as a despondent and catatonic infant. [11] [12]  Riley needed to regain her smile to completely purify Z-ARC's soul. Yuya was compelled by Declan to Duel several of their former allies to restore his adopted younger sister's smile through  Dueltaining  and overcome his fear of Z-ARC's return. [13]  Eventually Yuya confronted Declan in their final Duel to test his aptitude to become a pro Duelist and succeeded in defeating him, restoring Riley's smile and purifying Z-ARC's soul ensuring concord throughout the dimensions. [14]
