 Description 
 No one would suspect that the bubbly Blue Angel - the most popular Celebrity Duelist in LINK VRAINS - is actually the quiet and reserved Skye Zaizen. Her brother Akira is the current CEO of SOL Technologies - the megacorp that created LINK VRAINS. Though she's changed her avatar several times, she goes by Blue Angel when she wants to entertain her fans with her Trickstar Deck.
