For the  series , see  Dimension (series) .      
 In the game of  Dungeon Dice Monsters , unfolding a die on the field is called a  Dimension . Dimensioned dice are called  Dungeon Pieces , and they form the  Dungeon Paths  that will allow your monsters to reach your opponent's  Monster Lord .
 
       Dimensioned dice from the Japanese version of Dungeon Dice Monsters.     
 Each time that you roll 2  Summon Crests  of the same  Level , you can dimension 1 of your dice that shares the same Level and Type of at least 1 of the rolled Summon Crests. Each time that you dimension a die successfully, you must Summon a monster or an  Item  of the appropriate Level and Type to the newly formed  Dungeon Piece .
 The first die that you dimension in a duel must be attached to your  Monster Lord Area . Each die that you dimension subsequently can be attached to another of your Dungeon Pieces.
