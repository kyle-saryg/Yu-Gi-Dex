 Summary 
 Yuya  recaps that  Sylvio  and  Gong  took on a Duelist from the  Xyz Dimension ,  Kite . Before the attack of  Duel Academy , Kite was a member of  a Duel School  that was a rival to  Shay  and  Yuto 's, and was apparently skilled enough that he was expected to be the next Duel Champion of  Heartland . But all the awakened spirit of Yuto could feel from Kite was anger. Kite defeated both Sylvio and Gong, and Yuya called Gong and Sylvio's names and rushed forwards to help them, but Kite warned Yuya that he wouldn't escape either. Yuya turned and glared at Kite, who vowed to turn all of them into cards. 
 
       Gong  lies unconscious behind  Yuya  as he converses with  Kite .     
 Yuya declares that he won't let anyone else be turned into cards; Sylvio and Gong, the survivors in Heartland and even the soldiers of Duel Academy. Yuto warns Yuya that it's no use; Kite isn't going to listen to Yuya. Yuya replies that if Kite won't listen to him, then he'll have him understand through a Duel. What he learned from his Duel in  New Domino City  with  Jack , if he puts his words and feelings into a Duel, then even Kite will come to understand. But when Kite realizes that Yuya knows his name he decides that Yuya really is from Duel Academy (in the dub, he merely continues to condemn Yuya rather than reacting to his name). Yuya protests that he isn't from Duel Academy, but Kite explains that Duel Academy have put a bounty on his head. He has  turned  many of their soldiers into cards, so it's only a given, but Duel Academy have turned so many times more people into cards. That's why Kite swore that if Duel Academy would turn hundreds of his friends into cards, then he would make a thousand Duel Academy soldiers meet the same fate, and Yuya will soon suffer that fate. Kite activates his  Duel Disk  and asks Yuya if he is prepared to repent. Yuya replies that he only wants to talk to Kite with his Dueling and he activates his own Duel Disk, which declares " Field Spell :  Crossover ". As the platforms and blue light of "Crossover" materialize, Kite snaps that talk is pointless and Duel Academy only deserve death (in the dub, he says many have tried and all have failed, as will Yuya). The  Action Cards  scatter, and both Duelists declare, "Duel!"
 Kite declares that he's going first, and he Summons " Cipher Wing " from his hand, then he  Special Summons  another from his hand since he controls a "Cipher Wing". Gong gasps that Kite has two "Cipher Wings" again. Kite activates the  Continuous Spell Card  " Double Exposure ", doubling the  Levels  of his two  Level 4  "Cipher Wings" to  8 . Gong gasps that it's coming and Sylvio states that this is bad. Kite  overlays  his two Level 8 "Cipher Wings" and he  chants , "Galaxy shining in the darkness, embody the demon of revenge and become my very servant!  Xyz Summon ! Descend!  Rank 8 !  Galaxy-Eyes Cipher Dragon !" ("Now, by way of the cosmic energies that make up our galaxy, I'll make something just as mighty! I Xyz Summon! Galaxy-Eyes Cipher Dragon!" in the dub.) Gong observes "Galaxy-Eyes Cipher Dragon" and Sylvio notes that Kite has already Summoned his  ace monster . Kite  Sets  a card and he ends his turn. 
 
       Yuya  and  Yuto  converse.     
 Yuto tells Yuya that it's true that he was able to talk to Jack Atlas with his Dueling, and those feelings even reached Yuto's soul inside Yuya, but that was only because Jack was aiming for the same goal as Yuya. Yuya asks what that means and Yuto clarifies that both Jack and Yuya were wishing for the peace of New Domino City, but right now Kite is ruled by his hatred; a wild beast who bares his fangs at everything in his way (this comparison isn't in the dub). He begins to state that Yuya can't speak to him, but Yuya vows that he can and he believes that he can. Didn't Yuto believe that as well, when he told Yuya to bring smiles with his Dueling? He remembers Yuto's final moments, and points out that Kite is from the Xyz Dimension as well; there's no way that he doesn't want peace. He declares his turn and he draws, and then he uses the Scale 2 " Timebreaker Magician " and the Scale 4 " Performapal Whim Witch " to Set the  Pendulum Scale . 
 
       " Timebreaker Magician " uses its  Pendulum Effect .     
 Then Yuya activates the  Pendulum Effect  of "Timebreaker Magician" to double the Scale of "Whim Witch" to 8, allowing him to simultaneously Summon monsters from Levels 3 to 7. He chants, "Swing, pendulum of the soul! Draw an arc of light across the aether!  Pendulum Summon ! Appear now, my monsters! First up is  Performapal Drummerilla ! And one more…with your heroic and dichromatic eyes,  Odd-Eyes Pendulum Dragon ! ("Drum to it, Performapal Drummerilla! Turn up the heat, Odd-Eyes Pendulum Dragon!" in the dub)" Yuya declares his  Battle Phase , attacking "Galaxy-Eyes" with "Odd-Eyes". He activates the effect of "Drummerilla", allowing him to increase the  ATK  of a monster by 600 until the end of the Battle Phase. "Drummerilla" beats its chest to send out sonic waves and "Odd-Eyes" rises to 3100 ATK. Gong declares that the ATK of "Odd-Eyes" is higher than that of "Galaxy-Eyes" now, and Sylvio congratulates Yuya, telling him to take out Kite's  Dragon . Yuya declares that this is his Dueling and his words (in the dub, he reiterates that he and Kite are on the same side); he is putting all of his feelings into this attack. 
 
         " Performapal Drummerilla " turns into " Odd-Eyes ".     
 He begins to order the " Spiral Flame Strike " attack of "Odd-Eyes," but Kite activates the other effect of his "Double Exposure" Continuous Spell Card, allowing him once per turn to target a monster on the field and make it the same name as another monster in the same side of the field. He targets "Drummerilla", giving it the name of "Odd-Eyes Pendulum Dragon" and "Drummerilla" shrinks as an image of "Odd-Eyes" appears over it. Gong observes that there are two "Odd-Eyes" and Sylvio asks why (in the dub, Gong instead asks why, and Sylvio replies that he doesn't want to know). "Odd-Eyes" prepares to release its attack, but Kite activates a  Continuous Trap Card , " Double Sensorship ", allowing him to negate an attack from an monster that has the same name as another monster on the field. 
 
         " Odd-Eyes '" Spiral Flame Strike attack is extinguished.     
 Sonic waves spread out from "Drummerilla" and extinguish the launched plume of flame, causing Yuya to gasp in shock. Gong asks if Kite set up two "Odd-Eyes" just for this, and Yuto simply closes his eyes. Yuya admits the effect of "Drummerilla" ends and the ATK of "Odd-Eyes" returns to normal as "Odd-Eyes" lands. In addition, the Pendulum Effect of "Timebreaker Magician" ends and the Scale of "Whim Witch" returns to normal, and Yuya ends his turn. Gong observes that Yuya Pendulum Summoned "Drummerilla" with "Odd-Eyes" in order to battle with an increased ATK; there weren't any mistakes in Yuya's strategy, but the turn still ended without Yuya being able to do anything. Sylvio admits that Kite is pretty good, although since he took Sylvio out this was obvious no matter how one looks at it.
 Kite declares that Yuya's mistake was in Dueling him after he had fought Gong and Sylvio, much to Yuya's surprise. Kite explains that he never forgets the abilities of an opponent once he sees them. The Pendulum Summon that they used is a method to Summon multiple monsters and then use them in a combo; something that Kite knew from his Duel with Gong and Sylvio. Once Kite knows his enemy's strategy it becomes clear what actions he should take to counter it just as he did now. Gong tearfully apologizes for letting Yuya down again. Kite states that he's already seen through Yuya's strategy, which is why he will never be able to defeat Kite. 
 
         Yuya  stares in awe as  Kite  takes control of his " Odd-Eyes ".     
 Kite declares his turn and he draws a card, then he activates the "Cipher Subjection" effect of "Galaxy-Eyes Cipher Dragon" by  detaching  an Overlay Unit to take control of one of Yuya's monsters with its effects negated. He chooses "Odd-Eyes", and reminds Yuya that the monster will also be treated as "Galaxy-Eyes Cipher Dragon" and gain the same ATK. Light surrounds "Odd-Eyes" and transforms into "Galaxy-Eyes" as it rises to 3000 ATK. Kite also activates the Continuous Spell Card, " Cipher Interference " from his hand. He declares his Battle Phase and attacks "Drummerilla" with "Odd-Eyes". Gong gasps that Kite is making Yuya's monsters battle one another. Yuya activates the effect of "Drummerilla", increasing its ATK by 600 until the end of the Battle Phase. Yuto notes that this will reduce the damage that Yuya takes from this battle, but…and Kite calls it pointless, activating the effect of "Cipher Interference" since he controls two or more " Cipher " monsters, doubling the ATK of one during the Battle Phase. "Odd-Eyes" increases to 6000 ATK and Kite tells it to get Yuya. Yuya warns Kite that he won't let him get them for free and he sprints forwards. "Odd-Eyes" attacks with "Cipher Stream of Destruction", but Yuya snags an Action Card from a platform as "Odd-Eyes" builds up the stream of light. He activates the Action Spell "Miracle", preventing a monster's destruction and halving the battle damage. Yuya falls to 2100  LP  from the attack and Gong calls his name. Kite is surprised, but he realizes that Action Cards can also be used for defense. Sylvio comments that that isn't all; they can also buff monster effects, heal LP, and do even more. Kite snaps that he doesn't need Sylvio to explain; he will defeat them with his Dueling alone (in the dub, Sylvio mocks Kite for not figuring that out; Kite retorts that he has more Dueling ability in his finger than Sylvio's brain.) He attacks "Drummerilla" with "Galaxy-Eyes Cipher Dragon". Yuya curses and leaps for an Action Card, but the "Cipher Stream of Destruction" hits "Drummerilla" and destroys it, reducing Yuya to 1300 LP and knocking him down. Kite states that since the Battle Phase has ended, the effect of "Cipher Interference" ends as well, and he Sets a card to end his turn, then returns control of "Odd-Eyes" to Yuya. The light form of "Galaxy-Eyes" that was surrounding "Odd-Eyes" dissipates and "Odd-Eyes" returns to Yuya, though Kite notes that he will destroy it soon as well and that will be Yuya's final moments. Yuya grits his teeth in frustration. 
 
         " Dragoncaller Magician " becomes a Dragon type monster.     
 Getting to his feet, Yuya notes that Kite is strong, overwhelmingly strong, but what's even more amazing is how Kite intuitively sees through his opponent's strategy. It's just as Yuto said. Yuto notes that Kite's skills feel sharper than ever, like an aura that will slice through anything that gets close to it (in the dub, Yuya instead continues to think that he's not Kite's enemy, but Yuto tells him otherwise, because Kite is fighting for revenge). Right now, no amount of talk will reach Kite. Yuya states that that's all the more reason that he has to use his Dueling to talk to Kite's heart. He declares his turn and draws " Dragoncaller Magician ", noting that it's here. Gong asks if Yuya got a way out of this. Yuya activates the Pendulum Effect of the Set "Whim Witch" to Special Summon it from the  Pendulum Zone , and then he activates its monster effect, allowing him to treat it as two  Tributes  to  Tribute Summon  a  Pendulum Monster . "Whim Witch" splits in two and Yuya Tributes it to Tribute Summon "Dragoncaller Magician". Then Yuya activates the effect of "Dragoncaller Magician", allowing him to treat it as a Dragon- Type  monster. A draconian fork of lightning coils around "Dragoncaller Magician" and Yuto observes that now Yuya has two  Level 7  Dragon-Type monsters.
 
         " Odd-Eyes Rebellion Dragon " attacks  Kite 's " Galaxy-Eyes Cipher Dragon ".     
 Yuya vows to Yuto that he'll use his  strongest monster  and his strongest Dueling to wrench open Kite's heart. He overlays the Level 7 "Odd-Eyes Pendulum Dragon" and "Dragoncaller Magician", much to Kite's surprise. Yuya chants " Dragon of dual colored eyes . Unleash that  black scale of wrath , eradicate all opposing enemies! Xyz Summon! Come forth, Rank 7! Dragon with eyes of rage!  Supreme King Black Dragon - Odd-Eyes Rebellion Dragon !" ((Dub) "Dragon with blazing, raging eyes, come and conquer all that stand against you! I Xyz Summon! Odd-Eyes Rebellion Dragon!") Kite is shocked; not only did Yuya bring out a new dragon, but he Xyz Summoned it, and he asks who Yuya is. Yuya declares his Battle Phase, attacking "Galaxy-Eyes Cipher Dragon" with "Odd-Eyes Rebellion Dragon". Sylvio observes that both dragons have 3000 ATK and Gong wonders if Yuya is aiming for a draw. But Yuya states that he isn't; when a monster that used "Dragoncaller Magician" as Xyz Material battles another Dragon-Type monster, its ATK is doubled. An image of "Dragoncaller Magician" appears and transforms into the draconian fork of lighting, which enters "Odd-Eyes Rebellion Dragon" and increases it to 6000 ATK. Sylvio cheers that with this Yuya can win and he encourages Yuya to get revenge for them.
 
         " Odd-Eyes Rebellion Dragon " and " Galaxy-Eyes Cipher Dragon " strike.     
 Kite calmly activates a  Trap Card , " Double Cipher ". He detaches all of "Galaxy-Eyes Cipher Dragon's" Overlay Units and then he Special Summons another "Galaxy-Eyes Cipher Dragon" from his  Extra Deck  with its effects negated and ignoring its Summoning requirements. An  Overlay Network  appears and lightning erupts form it. Kite chants, "Galaxy shining in the darkness, embody the demon of revenge and become my very servant! Xyz Summon! Descend! Rank 8! Galaxy-Eyes Cipher Dragon! ((Dub) "I Xyz Summon! Galaxy-Eyes Cipher Dragon!")" Then he activates the effect of "Cipher Interference" now that he controls two or more "Cipher" monsters, doubling the ATK of "Galaxy-Eyes" to 6000. Gong is shocked; Kite is even using "Cipher Interference" defensively and Sylvio gasps that the ATK of the Dragons is equal again. "Odd-Eyes Rebellion Dragon" plunges its tusks into the ground and charges forwards, while "Galaxy-Eyes Cipher Dragon" powers up its wings and charges. The two monsters clash, struggling for a few seconds before eventually destroying one another. Gong is shocked that "Odd-Eyes Rebellion Dragon", Yuya's strongest monster, was destroyed. Sylvio asks how this could happen and notes that Kite still has another dragon left too. Yuya doesn't have any way to win like this.
 
         " Odd-Eyes Rebellion Dragon " is set on the  Pendulum Zone .     
 As Yuto glares at the angry Kite, Yuya gasps that this still isn't enough and he wonders what he should do to speak to Kite's heart. Yuto tells him to use the effect of "Odd-Eyes Rebellion Dragon", much to Yuya's surprise, and Yuto tells Yuya to just do it already as this is his only chance to use it. Yuya activates the effect of "Odd-Eyes Rebellion Dragon" since it was destroyed; allowing him to destroy all cards in the Pendulum Zone, and place itself in a Pendulum Zone. "Timebreaker Magician" dissipates to make room for "Odd-Eyes Rebellion Dragon". Then he activates the Pendulum Effect of "Odd-Eyes Rebellion Dragon", allowing him to place another Pendulum Card from his Deck into a Pendulum Zone, and he Sets the Scale 1 " Performapal Lebellman ", allowing him to simultaneously Summon  Level 2  to Level 3 monsters. Kite watches as Yuya declares a Pendulum Summon, telling his monsters to revive from his Extra Deck; "Timebreaker Magician" and "Performapal Whim Witch". Observing the two Level 3 monsters, Kite wonders if Yuya is planning to Xyz Summon again. 
 
         Yuya  and  Yuto   Xyz Summon  in unison.     
 Yuto states that there isn't even a shred of kindness in Kite's Dueling anymore and he's being driven by hatred. Yuya notes that he came this far hoping to lessen that hatred, and Yuto states that Kite's heart is closed off. Yuya admits that it's just like Yuto said; his Dueling must have worked in New Domino because Yuya was Dueling Jack, but he admits to himself that he knew that already; that with his power alone he doesn’t have enough to make everyone smile. Yuto laments that he feels powerless as well and he wonders right now, with their power, what is the right strategy to open Kite's heart? Is there a strategy that will even serve to knock on the closed door of his heart? Yuya thinks Yuto's name determinedly, and Yuto declares that this is the answer that he's found. (In the dub, Yuto, who has been faithless in Yuya's ability to get through to Kite thus far, throws his full support behind him, noting that he doesn't want them to be turned into cards, and together, they can make Kite change his ways.) Both of them declare in unison that they are activating the Pendulum Effect of "Le-Bellman"; once per turn they can increase the Levels of all monsters they control by one. "Le-Bellman" beats its head and "Timebreaker Magician" and "Whim Witch" become Level 4. Then they overlay the now-Level 4 "Timebreaker Magician" and "Performapal Whim Witch" and Yuya chants "Formed from pitch-black darkness, to fight those foolish enough to oppose it with its treacherous fangs! Now, descend!" Both of them declare, "Xyz Summon!" and Yuya chants, "Appear! Rank 4!  Dark Rebellion Xyz Dragon !" (Dub: "Cloaked in shadows and relentless in its objective, I call upon the most dangerous of dragons! Both: I Xyz Summon! Yuya: Dark Rebellion Xyz Dragon!") 
 
         Kite  sees  Yuto  within  Yuya .     
 Kite protests that it can't be, and Yuto states that it is; it's him. If Kite sees Yuto's ace monster, "Dark Rebellion Xyz Dragon", then he should remember; there's no way that he's forgotten the countless times that he Dueled Yuto and Shay and their Duel Schools. Kite is still in shock, asking why Yuya has that monster; did he steal it? He accuses Yuya of defeating Yuto and taking "Dark Rebellion"; but when he looks closely at Yuya for the first time he finally sees his resemblance to Yuto. He gasps that it can't be; Yuto? (In the dub, rather than mistake Yuya for Yuto, Kite muses that he senses Yuto's presence.)
 
         Shay  arrives on the scene with  two new   comrades .     
Shay's voice declares that that is Yuya. Kite gasps and he turns to see Shay walking up with a  red-haired boy  and a  bespectacled girl  as Shay states that Yuya is his comrade. Kite, Gong, and Sylvio all gasp Shay's name and the girl with Shay confirms what Shay has said; he has gathered comrades and brought them back. The red-haired boy notes that Shay has brought three of them at that; every comrade they can get now is precious, so it's a blessing. (In the dub, the boy notes the opposite; there might only be three, but every man counts.) Kite whispers, "Comrade?" and he looks at the three  Lancers . Shay asks if Kite doubts him, and he reassures Kite that Yuya hates this dimensional war and wants to stop the tyranny of Duel Academy from the bottom of his heart; something that Shay was convinced of during their battles in the  Synchro Dimension . Kite asks "Synchro Dimension?" Shay tells Kite to believe in him, and to believe in the Yuya Sakaki that he believes in.          Kite  refuses  his comrades'  offer to rejoin them.      The revelation of Yuya's last name causes Kite to repeat it in shock. The girl asks Kite to come back and work with them once again, but Kite refuses, snapping that he told them that he's done working with them (in the dub, he claims that he's better off on his own). He draws a card and slams it into his Duel Disk, and "Galaxy-Eyes Cipher Dragon's" wings glow with a blinding light that only Shay can see through. When the light fades, Kite is gone. Yuya sadly whispers Kite's name and Sylvio gasps in shock that Kite vanished.  The Resistance  members stare in shock and Yuto says Kite's name as everyone stares at the spot where Kite stood (in the dub, he says they have a new problem now).
 Featured Duel: Yuya Sakaki vs. Kite Tenjo 
         Yuya  vs.  Kite .     
 At the start of the  Duel , the  Field Spell Card  " Crossover " is  activated , as per the rules of an  Action Duel . It will allow the players to use  Action Cards , but they may only have one in their  hand  at a time.
 Turn 1: Kite 
 Kite   Normal Summons  " Cipher Wing " (1400/1200). As he  controls  a "Cipher Wing", Kite activates the effect of the other "Cipher Wing" in his hand,  Special Summoning  (1400/1200) in Attack Position. Kite activates the  Continuous Spell Card  " Double Exposure ", letting him double the  Levels  of two Level 6 or lower monsters with the same name he controls. He targets both "Cipher Wings" (both "Cipher Wings"   4 → 8). Kite  overlays  his two Level 8 monsters to  Xyz Summon  " Galaxy-Eyes Cipher Dragon " (3000/2500) in  Attack Position . Kite  Sets  a card.
 Turn 2: Yuya 
 Yuya  activates " Timebreaker Magician " (   2) and " Performapal Whim Witch " (   4) in his  Pendulum Zones . He then activates the  Pendulum Effect  of "Timebreaker", allowing him to double the  Scale  of a  Pendulum Monster  in the Pendulum Zone until the  End Phase . He selects and doubles the Scale of "Whim Witch" ("Whim Witch":    4 → 8). Yuya  Pendulum Summons  " Performapal Drummerilla " (1600/900) and " Odd-Eyes Pendulum Dragon " (2500/2000) from his hand, both in Attack Position. "Odd-Eyes"  attacks  "Cipher Dragon"; as a monster he controls is  battling , Yuya activates the effect of "Drummerilla", increasing the  ATK  of his monster by 600 until the end of the  Battle Phase  ("Odd-Eyes" 2500 → 3100 ATK). Kite activates the other effect of "Double Exposure", which allows him to change the name of a monster on the  field  to that of another monster on the same side. Kite changes the name of "Drummerilla" to "Odd-Eyes Pendulum Dragon". Since there are two or more monsters with the same name on the field and one of them declared an attack, Kite activates his  face-down  " Double Sensorship ", which lets him  negate  an attack  once per turn . Thus, the attack of "Odd-Eyes" is negated.
 Turn 3: Kite 
Kite activates the effect of "Cipher Dragon",  detaching  an  Overlay Unit  to take control of a monster his opponent controls until the End Phase. That monster's effects will be  negated  and it will be unable to attack  directly , but its name and ATK will become the same as that of "Cipher Dragon". He targets "Odd-Eyes" (2500 → 3000 ATK). Kite activates the Continuous Spell Card " Cipher Interference ". "Odd-Eyes", with its name treated as "Cipher Dragon", attacks "Drummerilla", but Yuya activates the effect of "Drummerilla/Odd-Eyes Pendulum Dragon", increasing its ATK by 600 (1600 → 2200 ATK) until the End Phase. Kite activates the effect of "Cipher Interference" as he controls two or more " Cipher " monsters with the same name and 1 is battling. The ATK of that monster doubles ("Odd-Eyes/Cipher Dragon" 3000 → 6000 ATK) until the end of the Battle Phase. Yuya finds and activates the Action Card, " Miracle ", preventing his monster's  destruction by battle  and halving the  battle damage  (Yuya: 4000 → 2100 LP). "Cipher Dragon" attacks "Drummerilla/Odd-Eyes Pendulum Dragon". Yuya attempts to get an Action Card, but is intercepted by the attack of "Cipher Dragon". The battle continues and "Drummerilla/Odd-Eyes Pendulum Dragon" is destroyed (Yuya: 2100 → 1300 LP). Kite Sets a card.
 Turn 4: Yuya 
Yuya  draws  " Dragoncaller Magician ". He Special Summons "Whim Witch" from his Pendulum Zone via its own Pendulum Effect. He  Tributes  "Whim Witch", which treats itself as two Tributes for the  Tribute Summon  of a Pendulum Monster via its effect, and  Tribute Summons  "Dragoncaller Magician" (2400/1000). Yuya activates the effect of "Dragoncaller", which allows him to treat it as a  Dragon - Type  monster until the End Phase. Yuya overlays his two Level 7 Dragon-Type monsters to Xyz Summon " Odd-Eyes Rebellion Dragon " (3000/2500) in Attack Position. "Odd-Eyes Rebellion" attacks "Cipher Dragon". Since "Dragoncaller" was used as material for the Summon of "Rebellion Dragon", its other effect activates, doubling its ATK as it is battling a Dragon-Type monster ("Rebellion Dragon" 3000 → 6000 ATK). Kite activates his face-down " Double Cipher ", which lets him detach all Overlay Units from a "Cipher Dragon" he controls to Special Summon another copy of "Cipher Dragon" (3000/2500) from his  Extra Deck ,  ignoring its Summoning conditions . With the effect of "Cipher Interference", he doubles the ATK of a "Cipher Dragon" ("Cipher Dragon" 3000 → 6000 ATK) until the end of the Battle Phase. A  replay  occurs and "Rebellion Dragon" attacks the first "Cipher Dragon", destroying them both. Since "Rebellion Dragon"  left the field , Yuya activates its effect, destroying existing cards in the Pendulum Zone and placing it (   4) in his left Pendulum Zone. Since there is no card in the other Pendulum Zone, Yuya activates the Pendulum Effect of "Rebellion Dragon", which allows him to place a Pendulum Monster from his Deck in the other Pendulum Zone. Yuya places " Performapal Lebellman " (   1) in his right Pendulum Zone. Yuya Pendulum Summons "Timebreaker" (1400/0) and "Whim Witch" (800/800) from his Extra Deck, both in Attack Position. He activates the Pendulum Effect of "Le-Bellman", which allows him to increase the Levels of all monsters on the field by 1 once per turn ("Timebreaker" and "Whim Witch"   3 → 4). Yuya overlays his two Level 4 monsters to Xyz Summon " Dark Rebellion Xyz Dragon " (2500/2000) in Attack Position.
 At this point, Kite withdraws, so the Duel ends with no result.

 When  Kite   Sets  a card at the end of his first  turn , it is briefly shown on the  field  and is a second copy of " Double Exposure ". When he  activates  it, the card is " Double Sensorship ". 
 When  Yuya   Pendulum Summons  using " Timebreaker Magician " and " Performapal Whim Witch " and the pendulum is shown swinging, his  monsters  have switched their positions in the  Pendulum Zone . 
 When Kite  Special Summons  his second " Galaxy-Eyes Cipher Dragon " from his  Extra Deck  via the effect of " Double Cipher ", he said the Summon is an  Xyz Summon , but the card's text indicates it is simply a Special Summon that  ignores Summoning conditions , though this could be the result of recycled voice clips. In the English dub, Kite makes it clear that the Summoning conditions are ignored. 
 In the English dub when Yuya uses  Performapal Drummerilla 's monster effect, he calls it his "Pendulum ability" instead.
