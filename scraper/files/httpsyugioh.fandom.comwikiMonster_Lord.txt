      "The Monster Lord is you!"     
 In the game of  Dungeon Dice Monsters , the  Monster Lord  ( ダンジョンマスター  -  "Dungeon Master"  in Japanese; also known as the  Die Master ) is the monster that each player uses to represent them in the  Dungeon , and is placed in the  Dungeon Master Zone . The Monster Lord has an  ATK  of 10 points, and can be used to  attack  like any other monster, but it cannot  defend  and cannot be  moved  throught the Dungeon.
 The  Monster Lord  is unaffected by the effects of all monsters and items in play, except those that specifically designate it as a target.
 Each Monster Lord has 3  HP , and takes 1  point of damage  each time it is attacked, regardless of the  ATK  of the attacking monster. The Duel is won when a player destroys their opponent's Monster Lord; if both players' Monster Lords are destroyed at the same time, the duel is declared a Draw.
