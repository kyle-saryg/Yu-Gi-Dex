 2000 years before the events of the series, the vassals served Alexander the Great, staying with him even after the majority of his armies deserted him. The vassals attempted to convince Alexander to give up his search for ultimate power, but he refused to. Having no more use for them, the  Millennium Ring  took their lives and trapped their souls in the pyramid.
