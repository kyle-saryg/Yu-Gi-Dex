 Characters 
 Most characters in the game are from the  Yu-Gi-Oh!  manga . A few original characters are added. Since the English manga mostly used characters' names from the Japanese version, while almost all other English media used the names from the English  anime , the English version of this game is the only place where English "dub" names are used for many characters.
