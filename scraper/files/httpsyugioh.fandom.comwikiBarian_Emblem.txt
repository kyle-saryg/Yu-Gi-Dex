 The  Barian Emblem  is the emblem symbolizing the  Barian World  and its  residents . Its origins lie in the past life of  Nash , leader of the  Seven Barian Emperors  in which he wore it as a pendant [1] . It appears as a stylized blue  fleur-de-lis  with a cross-section that encloses a red diamond-shaped gem at center.
 
       Nash 's Barian Emblem.     
 After Nash's death in his past life, he was reincarnated as a  Barian  and was chosen as the Barian leader by the denizens of Barian World. Due to this, his emblem came to symbolize the Barian World and its residents. Each of the  Seven Barian Emperors  possess similar, though unrelated emblems. Those who are brainwashed by a Barian have this emblem appear on their foreheads and no longer require the need of their own  Duel Gazers  to see the  augmented reality . One of their eyes just becomes red instead. [2]  When  Vector  possessed  Dr. Faker , the emblem appeared on his forehead. [3] 
 Also, all those who are brainwashed by the Barians have a tendency to say "Barian sekai no tame ni", meaning "for (the sake of) the Barian World".

 The emblem is also known to hold past memories of  Nash . Later on,  Dumon  presented it to  Shark  as it originally belong to him. If it did belong to him, it would be certain to reveal the truth. He urges him to touch and awaken his and  Rio  original memories from the ruins and his reasons for becoming the leader of the Barians. [4]
