 Paradox  is the main antagonist in  Yu-Gi-Oh! 3D Bonds Beyond Time  who is able to travel through time and space to change his destroyed future by killing  Maximillion Pegasus  to prevent  Duel Monsters  from being created. 
 He was one of mankind's last four survivors in an apocalyptic future, along with  Z-one ,  Aporia  and  Antinomy . Unlike his fellow survivors, not much of his backstory prior to meeting the other survivors is shown. 
 His name is derived from the concept of "paradox" in the theory of time. According to it, a paradox is created if the past is altered which then changes the future entirely. This references his mission of changing history by destroying the game of  Duel Monsters  to prevent his own terrible future from happening, which would have caused catastrophic and drastic changes to the future had he succeeded
 He is the only one of Z-one's comrades to not guard a Planetary Particle as he was defeated before then.  Sherry LeBlanc  replaces him as the third guard of a Planetary Particle.

 Biography 
 Yu-Gi-Oh! 5D's 
       Paradox in the ruined future in  Yu-Gi-Oh! 5D's .     
 Paradox was  one of the survivors  of the " Meklord Emperor " genocide along with  Z-one  and  Antinomy , who eventually discover a fourth survivor,  Aporia . Together, the four of them had conducted many experiments in order to prevent the genocide, succeeding in granting Z-one eternal life thanks to a life support system they created. However, Paradox alongside Antinomy and Aporia eventually died from natural causes and were placed in capsules, leaving Z-one the only survivor. [2] 
 
         The death of the original Paradox.     
 Yu-Gi-Oh! 3D: Bonds Beyond Time 
         Paradox Linework.     
           
 A robotic copy of Paradox's younger self was created by Z-one, and programmed with his original self's hatred of  Duel Monsters  for bringing about the end of the world. Paradox was charged with killing the game's creator,  Maximillion Pegasus , and given a  Duel Runner  capable of traveling into the past to assassinate him. If Pegasus was killed before recreating the  Shadow Games  as  Duel Monsters , this would effectively rewrite the future; thus, the  Meklord Emperor Genocide  that destroyed Paradox's world would never have occurred.
 However, Paradox decided to go about this in a different manner; rather than simply kill Pegasus, he decided to kill him at a large public  Duel Monsters'  event, to scare the populace into thinking that the game was the cause and make its popularity drop. If successful, this would cause a domino effect on the timeline, wiping  Duel Monsters ' influence from history. Paradox was aware there may be negative consequences, but believed it was necessary, as many great evils had threatened the world by using  Duel Monsters .
 Paradox traveled to the  New Domino City , during  Yusei Fudo 's time. He interrupted a  Turbo Duel  between Yusei,  Crow Hogan , and  Jack Atlas . Yusei had just Summoned " Stardust Dragon ", but Paradox absorbed it into a blank card. When confronted, he showed Yusei the corrupted card before vanishing through time again.
 
         Paradox with his mask.     He traveled further back in time to Venice, during  Jaden Yuki 's time. Causing massive destruction, Paradox attacked Jaden with " Cyber End Dragon " and " Rainbow Dragon ".  Elemental Hero Neos  protected Jaden, so Paradox Summoned "Stardust Dragon" to fight off "Neos". However, Yusei who has traveled back in time with help from the  Crimson Dragon  arrived and saved Jaden. Though unsure of how Yusei followed him back into the past, Paradox decides to let the alterations to the timeline finish him and Jaden off.
 Paradox proceeded to visit an event where Pegasus was giving cards to young children, in  Yugi Muto 's time, where he  used "Cyber End Dragon," "Rainbow Dragon" and "Stardust Dragon" to attack the area. Obsessed with the utter destruction of the "plague" that destroyed his home time, Paradox cared little for the other people in the area, killing them along with Pegasus and  Solomon Muto  with a falling building. Paradox witnessed the aftermath of his attack and claimed that with this the world had been saved. Yusei and Jaden arrived in this time and recruited Yugi, who was the lone survivor of Paradox's attack, to fight Paradox.
 
Yusei, Jaden, and Yugi traveled back in time to exactly thirty minutes before Pegasus' event, scaring off the patrons to keep them alive. Paradox (from before his attack in the alternate timeline) arrived to stop them from interfering. He explained what his goals are and how despite their efforts, Yugi, Jaden, and Yusei would be unable to prevent the world's eventual destruction. Enraged, the three challenged Paradox to a 3-on-1 Duel. Paradox accepted and transformed his Duel Runner into a hovercraft.         Paradox moments before his death.      Paradox used " Malefic World " and his corrupt " Malefic " counterparts of existing monsters. Yusei, Jaden, and Yugi managed to retrieve "Stardust Dragon" from him, but Paradox retaliated with " Malefic Truth Dragon " and pushed them into a corner. As he was about to win, Paradox taunted Yusei. However, with Jaden and Yugi's help, Paradox's final attack failed and the three overpowered "Malefic Truth Dragon" and won the Duel, which destroyed Paradox in the process. Right before dying, Paradox wondered if his experiment was wrong.
 Z-one later mentioned Paradox when explaining his plans to  Team 5D's , and Yusei recognizes his name and remembers his encounter with him. Z-one revealed that it was him who had sent Paradox to the past. [3]  Before he died, Z-one said that by remembering Paradox, Antinomy and Aporia's bond he was able to find the strength to fight by himself, and that he considered the three to be his family. [4] 
 
 Abilities 
 Paradox possesses a  Duel Runner  that bears similarities to the one used by Aporia. The Duel Runner is shown to travel through time and change between modes. Like Yusei's Duel Runner, Paradox possesses a hybrid model.
 
 "Ground Mode" "Flight Mode"       Paradox's Duel Runner  in motorcycle mode.      Paradox's Duel Runner operates much like other Duel Runners, allowing him to activate Turbo Duels. It is in this form that his Duel Runner shows the ability to travel through time and space.       Paradox's Duel Runner  in flight mode.      When Paradox Duels Yugi, Jaden, and Yusei, he activates a flight mode for his Duel Runner, allowing him to materialize his cards and manipulate the  field  itself. 
 Although not explicit in the movie, Paradox is an android much like  Aporia  and  Antinomy . He is capable of creating  corrupted  versions of the  signature cards  of other  Yu-Gi-Oh!  characters in the franchise. 
 Paradox is capable of merging with his ace monster, " Malefic Truth Dragon ".
 Paradox has also demonstrated the ability to steal Duel Monsters right out of their cards (such as with " Stardust Dragon " during his Turbo Duel with Yusei) using a blank card, and the ability to bring them to life (he demonstrated this ability with " Cyber End Dragon ", " Rainbow Dragon " and "Stardust Dragon" during his attack on Venice, and his attack on the Domino Duel Tournament).
 
 Deck 
 Paradox plays a   " Malefic " Deck , made of up of an  archetype  of  DARK - Attribute   Dragon - Type   monsters  (with the exception of " Malefic Cyber End Dragon " and " Malefic Parallel Gear ", both of which are  Machine -Type) which are corrupt versions of the  trump cards  of other  Yu-Gi-Oh!  characters, which he traveled through time to steal.
 Paradox's preferred  Field Spell  is " Malefic World ", which gives him the option of skipping his  Draw Phase  each  turn , and instead adding a "Malefic" monster to his  hand  from his  Deck . His monsters are supported by several  Spell  and  Trap Cards  that include the word "Malefic" in their names.
