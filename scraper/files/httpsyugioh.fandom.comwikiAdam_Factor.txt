      Shun ,  Shingo  and  Yuzu  witness  Yuya 's and  Reiji 's Adam Factors resonating.     
 The  Adam Factor  (アダムの因子  Adamu no Inshi ) is a mysterious plot element in the  Yu-Gi-Oh! ARC-V  manga .
 As  Ren  reveals to  Yuya , the Adam Factor is the scattered soul of the scientist Adam after he absorbed most of  Genesis Omega Dragon 's energy to prevent a cataclysm. [1]   Isaac  reveals that the Adam Factor's existence limits the G.O.D card's power and thus became the goal of Adam's lover  Eve  and her followers to extract the Adam Factor by defeating those who possess it. [2] 
 During his  Turbo Duel  against  Yugo  inside  Yuya 's mind, Ren confirmed that Yuya possesses part of the Adam Factor which was invoked in consequence. [3]  This was later revealed to be disrupting Yuya's connection with his counterparts Yugo,  Yuto , and  Yuri .
 Reiji is later shown to possess the other half of the Adam Factor during his Duel with Yuya, the battle between Yuya's " Odd-Eyes Phantasma Dragon " and Reiji's " D/D/D Destiny King Zero Laplace " causing the two Adam Factors to resonate with each other before Ren appeared and revealed them both as his group's targets. [4]
