 " "C" ", known as " G " ( Ｇ   Jī  for "Gokiburi" (ゴキブリ), meaning "Cockroach") in Japanese, is a  series  of  EARTH   Insect   Monsters  with different Levels whose  effects  rely on the opponent  Special Summoning  a monster(s).
 The "C" stands for  cockroach , and their artworks feature cockroaches (whose eyes are denoted by sparkles) within common household locations that they can inhabit. This is made clear by  the sprite  used for " Shiny Black "C" " in  Yu-Gi-Oh! 5D's World Championship 2010: Reverse of Arcadia . The border of each card artwork also features an ominous-looking, darkened foreground.
