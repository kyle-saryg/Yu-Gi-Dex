 MacKenzie's Stealth Maneuvers!! 
 
 "The Exchange Battle Heats Up!!"  is the fifty-seventh chapter of the  Yu-Gi-Oh! GX  manga . It was first printed in Japanese in the  V Jump  magazine and in English in the  Shonen Jump  magazine. Both of which were printed in  volume 9  of the  Yu-Gi-Oh! GX  graphic novels afterwards.
 The  Duels  between the Japanese and American  Duel Academies  continue, with each Duelist pursuing separate goals.  Tragoedia  enacts the final stages of his plan.
 
 Summary 
 Duel Academy 's students watch the unfolding  Duels  via the monitors spread across campus. They're happy to see that  Syrus  currently has the advantage over  Jesse . More Duels are starting as well.  Zane  sees that  Alexis  will Duel  Aster  next. He asks  Atticus  how he far he thinks his sister will be able to push Aster. Turning around, he sees Atticus has disappeared. Aster and Alexis meet at the lighthouse for their Duel, while  Bastion  and  James  begin their own encounter in the forest.  Chazz  and  Axel  meet at the cliff.
 Aster comments that first he Dueled Atticus, now his opponent is his younger sister. He muses he must have some connection to them. Alexis responds that she couldn't have picked a better opponent for herself, but that it's too bad that Bastion wasn't selected to Duel Aster - he had been eager to do so earlier. James comments that his opponent is the  Yokai  Duelist, and Bastion introduces himself in response. James states the Duel will be not be interrupted by anyone, and that they'll Duel his way. When the Duel is done, Bastion will join his  Zombie  monsters. Axel asks Chazz to confirm something for him and reveals that he saw video footage of the latter's Duel with  David . He tells Chazz that many students have been falling unconscious after Dueling at the American academy - just as David did after fighting Chazz. He reveals that  his father  had been a professional Duelist two years ago, and had lost consciousness after being defeated. Axel enrolled at the American academy thinking that he could uncover information about the  Shadow Games . Watching Chazz's Duel with David confirmed his suspicions - David was related to them. Chazz does not respond, and Axel suggests they settle it with a Duel - if Axel wins, Chazz will tell him everything he knows. Chazz agrees to this, and Axel vows find the truth and save his father. Chazz comments that Axel is much like him and  Jaden  - he is after the truth.
 The Duel between Syrus and Jesse continues, with the latter saying it is becoming a fun Duel. Jesse  Normal Summons  " Roachie " in  Attack Position , causing Syrus to look sick. Jesse tells him that cockroaches are awesome, with Syrus responding that he should give up on that particular insect. Jesse attacks " Einroid " with " Needle Honey Bee ",  activating  the former card's  effect . Syrus  sends  " Dreiroid " and " Vierroid " from his  Deck  to the  Graveyard . He comments he just needs one more in the Graveyard. "Roachie" attacks and destroys " Zweiroid ", with Syrus activating his  face-down  " Loaner Delivery ", Special Summoning the  Level  4 " Shovelroid " from his Deck in Attack Position. Jesse  Sets  " Spider Restraint " and " Evasion Under Fire ". Syrus  draws  " Satelliteroid " and comments that it's the perfect card for this situation. He  Tributes  "Shovelroid" to Summon it in Attack Position. He uses its effect to  discard  " Fünfroid " and destroy Jesse's Set "Spider Restraint". Syrus plays " Ultimate Machine Union ", declaring that he can use it to  remove  " Roid "  Fusion Material Monsters  in his Graveyard from play to  Fusion Summon  the appropriate  Fusion Monster . He removes "Einroid", "Zweiroid", "Vierroid", "Dreiroid" and "Fünfroid" to Fusion Summon " Barbaroid, the Ultimate Battle Machine " in Attack Position. Both Jesse and the crowd are impressed.
 Syrus decides he'll attack "Roachie" first, as the effect of "Needle Honey Bee" would be troublesome. He attacks, but Jesse activates his face-down "Evasion Under Fire", reducing the  Battle Damage  he takes to 0. The effect of "Roachie" activates and Jesse Special Summons a Level 3 or lower  Insect - Type  monster from his Deck - " Lady Beetle " in  Defense Position . He reveals that it can't be  destroyed by battle  the first time it battles each turn. Knowing that "Needle Honey Bee" would reduce his monster's ATK, Syrus ends his turn, frustrated he has a 4000-ATK monster and can do no damage with it. Jesse draws " The Tripper Mercury ", commenting it's the perfect draw, but first, he needs to destroy "Satelliteroid". Jesse Sets a card, with Syrus declaring he'll just destroy it with "Satelliteroid". Jesse Tributes "Needle Honey Bee" and "Lady Beetle" to Summon " Queen Butterfly Danaus " in Attack Position. Syrus is shocked he'd put in Attack Position when Syrus has "Barbaroid", but realizes he plans to destroy "Satelliteroid". Jesse tells him that's the "correct answer", and "Danaus" attacks and destroys "Satelliteroid" with  Danaus Storm . Syrus begins his turn, drawing " Support Mission ", while his hand contains " Escape ". Syrus is disappointed that he didn't draw a monster. He could destroy "Danaus", but he also has Jesse's face-down card to worry about. Jesse declares he is activating the effect of "Danaus". He reduces its ATK to 0 to Special Summon three Insect-Type monsters from his Graveyard in Attack Position. He Special Summons "Needle Honey Bee", "Roachie" and "Lady Beetle". Jesse activates his face-down " Defensive Instinct ", switching all his monsters to Defense Position. Syrus curses, but attacks and destroys "Danaus" with "Barbaroid".
 
       Jesse is overtaken by  Tragoedia .     
 As Jesse draws, his eyes go dark as he states that "it was a fun duel." Syrus asks what that's supposed to mean.  Tragoedia , watching through  Principal MacKenzie , has possessed Jesse. He Tributes his three monsters to Summon "The Tripper Mercury" in Attack Position. Its effect activates, reducing the ATK of all other monsters on the  field  to 0. Tragoedia tells "Mercury" to absorb the the souls of the Duelists. Syrus realizes that he's felt a strange sensation since "Mercury" was Summoned - similar to what was felt when Chazz Dueled David. Jesse activates " Forbidden Substance ", which will allow "Mercury" to attack twice this  turn . Tragoedia tells Syrus that it's been fun, and Syrus asks what Jesse really is. "Mercury" attacks and destroys "Barbaroid" and then attacks  directly , reducing Syrus' Life Points to 0 with  Temperature Change . At the warehouse on Duel Academy's docks, MacKenzie stands in front of Tragoedia's broken tablet. He states it is time to put the final piece in. In the forests on the mountain, Jaden finds  Adrian  unconscious, and he determines that that must mean that their Duel was a Shadow Game. He kneels down, thinking he should take Adrian to  the nurse . Before he can, he is confronted by Atticus, who has appeared behind him.
