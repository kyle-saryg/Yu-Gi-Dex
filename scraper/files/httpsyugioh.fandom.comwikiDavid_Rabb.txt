 David Rabb  (デイビッド・ラブ,  Deibiddo Rabu ) is a Duelist from the  United States  and companion of  Zane "Kaiser" Truesdale  who he follows to  Duel Academy . After arriving at Duel Academy along with Zane and  Reggie MacKenzie , David participates in the tournament hosted by Duel Academy, easily trouncing  Syrus Truesdale . He later crosses paths with  Jaden Yuki , but decides not to Duel him because of his  Slifer Red  status as the defeat of a Slifer Red will get him a meager amount of points compared to  Ra Yellow  and  Obelisk Blue  students. Because he is fluent in both English and Japanese, he is able to converse with the other characters. In addition, at some point before coming to Duel Academy, David was beaten in a Duel by  Atticus Rhodes , further motivating him to defeat  Alexis Rhodes  in a single turn during the tournament. David is defeated by  Chazz Princeton , whose final attack shatters the earring and releases David from  Tragoedia 's control.  James Crocodile Cook  later reveals that he had been rivals with Rabb when they both in America, and Jim seeks out Atticus as the latter was able to defeat Rabb before he did.
 
       David Rabb possessed by Tragoedia

 Trivia 
 David's name appears to be a play on the character Captain Harmon "Harm" Rabb, Jr. from the American television show JAG (Judge Advocate General), especially with Rabb and MacKenzie's military uniforms. 
 In one manga chapter Chazz stated that he thinks David's family name "Rabb" is a weird name in his opinion. 
 When David and Jaden first met the latter wanted to ask David for a duel but was unsure how to tell it with words since Jaden first thought that David wouldn't understand Japanese because he's from America. David, however, stated that he understands and speaks Japanese without having any trouble which made Jaden feel awkward for a moment. 
 Also upon his first meeting with Jaden, David didn't take note of  Winged Kuriboh 's despite his ability to see/feel the presence of duel spirits.
 This is strange since Reggie instantly took note of Jaden's Winged Kuriboh's spirit.
