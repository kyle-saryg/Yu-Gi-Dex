With the announcement of Photon Sabre Tiger, I decided to revamp my Tiger deck. I took out the Tiger Axes (though I really shouldn't have, probably would've been better than Soul Tiger, but whatever), put in Rescue Rabbit for more swarming (just one, though, since they're so damn expensive), and Dark Desertapir and Unicorn Beacon for recursion, especially with Beast Rising. I hope it works out as well as I think it will.  SynjoDeonecros  ( talk  •  contribs ) 03:21, October 8, 2011 (UTC)
 Since they kill a lot of decks this format,  Dimensional Fissure  or  Macro Cosmos , maybe???
 
 I've got a few, so if need be, I can swap out Spiritual Forest for Fissure. Not sure if I'd want to, though, but I'll see. at the very least, if I can figure out one, I'll side deck it.  SynjoDeonecros  ( talk  •  contribs ) 04:56, December 20, 2011 (UTC) 
 Okay, so I've been looking through this deck, and I've been thinking about replacing the following cards:
 
 Soul Tiger 
 The All-Seeing White Tiger (which means, if I replace both of them, Rescue Rabbit will have to go) 
 Offerings to the Doomed 
 Crystal Beast Topaz Tiger 
 Spiritual Forest 
 Beast Rising 
 Can anyone give me ideas on how to go about replacing these? I want to utilize Unicorn Beacon and Dark Desertapir in this deck, so please keep that in mind.  SynjoDeonecros  ( talk  •  contribs ) 00:25, December 21, 2011 (UTC)
 Okay, using suggestions made from another board, I came up with this deck and side deck. Tell me what you think of it.  SynjoDeonecros  ( talk  •  contribs ) 19:52, December 21, 2011 (UTC)
 I'm not too sure about the side deck, honestly. Anyone have any ideas on what I can do to update it? Also, should I put a side deck in here? Say, for Xyz monsters?  SynjoDeonecros  ( talk  •  contribs ) 03:33, December 24, 2011 (UTC)
 EDIT: I changed the side deck to be a bit more useful to me. Still dunno about an Extra Deck, though...  SynjoDeonecros  ( talk  •  contribs ) 23:00, December 24, 2011 (UTC)
 Another change, mostly replacing Offerings for Prohibition. I just thought it would be much better than Offerings for side decking, in this case.  SynjoDeonecros  ( talk  •  contribs ) 01:56, December 27, 2011 (UTC)
 Okay, changed my deck, added an Extra Deck of Xyzs I can get a hold of (if it were able to be more consistent, I'd throw in Natural Tune and add in some level 6-8 Synchros, as well) and added a second Rabbit, which makes the deck a lot more consistent and a lot more playable. This is my budget deck, so don't be surprised at the cheap cards.  SynjoDeonecros  ( talk  •  contribs ) 23:18, January 2, 2012 (UTC)
