Link: https://yugioh.fandom.com/wiki/Ritual_Summoning_condition

A  Ritual Summoning condition  is a  condition  printed on  Ritual Monsters  which indicates the intended  Ritual Spell Card  to  Ritual Summon  it. This is always listed at the start of the  card text .
 This means that Ritual Monsters are  Special Summon-only monsters , so must first be  Ritual Summoned  before they can be  Special Summoned  by any other effect, such as " Monster Reborn ". The card text of  non-Effect  Ritual Monsters comprises only the monster's Ritual Summoning condition.  Nonspecific Ritual Spell Cards , such as " Advanced Ritual Art " and " Contract with the Abyss ", can be used to Ritual Summon monsters that meet the requirements of the Ritual Spell Card, despite older structures of the Ritual Summoning condition stating otherwise.
 Prior to its  Legendary Collection 3: Yugi's World Mega Pack  reprint, " Relinquished " was the only Ritual Monster without a listed Ritual Summoning condition.
