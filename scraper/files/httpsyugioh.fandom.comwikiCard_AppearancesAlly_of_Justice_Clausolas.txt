 Yu-Gi-Oh! 5D's 
 In  episode 106 , one of the  Diablo  Duelbots uses this card during the Battle Royale that was around  Neo Domino City . This card attacks a  Team Burning  Duelist directly, but  Kaz  sends " Battle Eater " from his hand to the Graveyard to negate the attack and end the Battle Phase. After that, "Battle Eater" inflicts damage to Kaz equal to its ATK. Later " Red Dragon Archfiend " (whose ATK was 5000 due to the effect of " Vice Berserker ") attacks and destroys this card. The Diablo Duelbot then drops out of the Duel, so Jack and Kaz win. 
 This monster appears behind several  Duelbots  in  BELIEVE IN NEXUS  along with " Ally of Justice Garadholg ", " Ally of Justice Nullfier ", and " Ally Salvo ".
