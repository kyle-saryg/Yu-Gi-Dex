 Summary 
 Skeleton Knight's turn 
 Yusei  is right in front of the  Skeleton Knight  with 3200  Life Points , while the knight has 2300. Yusei has " Mighty Warrior " on his side of the field. The knight has " Hellfire Sleeping Beauty, Ghost Sleeper " and is just after playing " Ghost Fusion ". Yusei vows to win the Duel for  Sect .
 
         The entrance of " Underworld Dragon Dragonecro ".     
 The Skeleton Knight thanks Yusei for the pain and in return he shall show him some of his power. " Ghost Fusion " activates and fuses " Hellfire Sleeping Beauty, Ghost Sleeper" with the " Hellfire Dragon, Ghost Wyvern " in is Deck. The two monsters are dragged into a vortex. The souls are calling the master of the Underworld, the knight explains. A new creature emerges by breaking a hole in the dark. The monster, " Underworld Dragon Dragonecro ", is Summoned to the Skeleton Knight's side of the field in  Attack Position  with 3000  ATK . Yusei is surprised to see such a massive creature and the entrance it made.
 The Skeleton Knight starts his  Battle Phase . He has "Underworld Dragon Dragonecro" attack " Mighty Warrior ". "Dragonecro" takes a bite from "Mighty Warrior" and pulls out a blackened version of the same monster. Yusei's  Duel Runner  starts to swerve and his Life Points lower to 2400.
 The blackened "Mighty Warrior" now stands on the Skeleton Knight's side of the field. The knight explains that "Dragonecro's" effect allows him to steal the souls of monsters it battles. The Skeleton Knight now controls " Mighty Warrior: Dark Soul ", which has the same  ATK  as "Mighty Warrior" and 0  DEF . The original "Mighty Warrior" still stands on Yusei's side of the field, stripped of its soul, causing its ATK to lower to 0.
 
         " Mighty Warrior: Dark Soul " and the original " Mighty Warrior ", stripped of its soul.     
 "Mighty Warrior: Dark Soul" attacks "Mighty Warrior" using its "Mighty Dark Knuckle" attack. Yusei coughs blood, as his he takes 2200 damage, lowering his Life Points to 200. The "Dark Soul" counterparts are unable to destroy monsters by battle, so "Mighty Warrior" remains on Yusei's field.
 Yusei struggles to stay conscious as he comes close of a wall of fire. He starts to wonder if he can even beat a monster with such a Dark Feel. Meanwhile over on the alter,  Sect  starts to barely move and says Yusei's name. Standing himself up, he stats that he doesn't believe his rival Yusei will be defeated here and that he shall be the only duelist to defeat Yusei. He screams out Yusei's name, causing Yusei to quickly regain control of himself and pull clear of the fire.
 Yusei activates his  face-down  card " Shock Draw ", allowing him to draw 1 card for each increment of 1000 damage he took last turn. He draws 3 cards and convinces himself that the monster he's up against can be defeated and refuses to lose the Duel.
 
 
 Yusei's turn 
         Yusei and Sect draw the card.     
 Yusei begins his turn. As he  draws , Sect makes the same hand movements. They both close their eyes and touch their arms, where Yusei has his Deck fastened. Imagining Sect behind him in the same position, Yusei draws his next card; " Righty Driver ".
 Yusei Summons " Righty Driver ". Seeing a  Tuner monster , the knight worries about what's about to happen. Yusei tunes "Righty Driver" with "Mighty Warrior" and  Synchro Summons  " Lightning Warrior ". Yusei orders "Lightning Warrior" to destroy the fake soul turned dark. Using its "Lightning Punisher" attack, "Lightning Warrior"  attacks  and  destroys  "Mighty Warrior: Dark Soul". The Skeleton Knight's Life Points drop to 2100. "Lightning Warrior's" effect "Lightning Ray" then activates, inflicting 400 damage to the knight for every card in his  hand . "Lightning Warrior" blasts the knight, taking away 1600 more Life Points, leaving him at 500. (" Lightning Warrior 's" effect is different in the manga. In real life the monster must be sent to the Graveyard for "Lightning Warrior" to inflict the effect damage, while in the manga the monster only needs to be  destroyed . " Mighty Warrior: Dark Soul " is not a card, so it did not go to the Graveyard. In the manga, it inflicts 400 damage per card, rather than 300).
 Yusei and the Skeleton Knight are now side-by-side. Yusei  Sets  2 cards in his  Spell & Trap Card Zone . The knight laughs that this interesting that Yusei could push him this hard.
 
 Skeleton Knight's turn 
 The Skeleton Knight starts his turn and leaps up to higher ground. Yusei notices him speeding up and vows not to let him get ahead and speeds up.
 The knight commands "Dragonecro" to steal a new soul. The dragon starts to close in on "Lightning Warrior". Sect screams out Yusei's name, while the knight hopes that this should finish Yusei.
 
 Featured Duel: Yusei Fudo vs. Skeleton Knight 
 Duel continues from  the previous Ride . 
 The Skeleton Knight activates " Ghost Fusion ",  sending  the " Hellfire Sleeping Beauty, Ghost Sleeper " on his  field  and a " Hellfire Dragon, Ghost Wyvern " from his  Deck  to the  Graveyard  to  Fusion Summon  " Underworld Dragon Dragonecro " (3000/0) in  Attack Position . "Underworld Dragon Dragonecro"  attacks  " Mighty Warrior ", but doesn't  destroy  it due to its own  effect  (Yusei: 3200 → 2400). The other effect of "Dragonecro"  Special Summons  " the dark soul of "Mighty Warrior" " (2200/2000) to the Skeleton Kight's side of the field and reduces the  ATK  "Mighty Warrior" to 0. "Mighty Warrior's" Dark Soul" attacks "Mighty Warrior", but doesn't destroy it due to its own effect [Notes 1]  (Yusei: 2400 → 200). Yusei activates his  face-down  " Shock Draw ",  drawing  3 cards as he took 3000 points of damage this  turn .
 Turn 5: Yusei 
Yusei draws and  Normal Summons  " Righty Driver " (100/300). He then tunes the  Level  1 "Righty Driver" and the Level 6 "Mighty Warrior" to  Synchro Summon  " Lightning Warrior " (2400/1200) in Attack Position. "Lightning Warrior" attacks and destroys "Mighty Warrior's" Dark Soul (Skeleton Knight: 2300 → 2100). The effect of "Lightning Warrior" activates, inflicting 1600 damage to the Skeleton Knight as he has 4 cards in his  hand  (Skeleton Knight: 2100 → 500). Yusei  Sets  2 cards.
