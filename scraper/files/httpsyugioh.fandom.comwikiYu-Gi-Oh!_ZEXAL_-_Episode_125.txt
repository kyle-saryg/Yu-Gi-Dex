 Summary 
       The other  Over-Hundred "Numbers"  prepare to evolve.     
 As  Nash  declares " Chaos Draw ", each of the other involved  Emperors   draws  their card, holding it high above their heads as each is engulfed in light. As the resulting pillars of light radiate upward,  Tori  wonders what they are, while  Astral  says that he's never felt something this powerful before. Everyone else in the car simply stares in shock.  Quattro  wonders what's going on and Nash says that he did tell him before - the real power of the Seven Barian Emperors is born of  Chaos . As the light dissipates, Nash plays his drawn card - " Rank-Up-Magic - The Seventh One ". He explains that it will  Rank-Up  an  Over-Hundred "Number"  into a  "Chaos Number" . Quattro is confused and reminds Nash that his "Number" is in the  Graveyard . Nash responds that it doesn't matter - this card will  target  it no matter where it is, though its  effects  will be  negated  if it is from the Graveyard. " Number 101: Silent Honor ARK " is  Special Summoned  from the Graveyard and Nash reconstructs the  Overlay Network  at the same time as the other Emperors -  Mizar  with " Number 107: Galaxy-Eyes Tachyon Dragon ",  Girag  with " Number 106: Giant Hand ",  Alito  with " Number 105: Battlin' Boxer Star Cestus ",  Marin  with " Number 103: Ragnazero ", and  Dumon  with " Number 102: Star Seraph Sentry ". Each of them performs a  Chaos Xyz Evolution .
 
         " Chaos Number 101: Silent Honor DARK " ejects from the cockpit of " Number 101: Silent Honor ARK ".      Mizar brings out " Chaos Number 107: Neo Galaxy-Eyes Tachyon Dragon ", Girag Summons " Chaos Number 106: Giant Red Hand ", Alito calls forth " Chaos Number 105: Battin' Boxer Comet Cestus ",  Marin  unveils " Chaos Number 103: Ragnafinity " and Dumon wields " Chaos Number 102: Archfiend Seraph ". Finally, the pilot of "Silent Honor ARK" bursts forth from its compartment and is encased in armor as Nash chants , "O Guardian of Souls that have yet to mature, become the Dark Knight and crush the Light!". Fully armored now, " Chaos Number 101: Silent Honor DARK " descends and twirls its spear around. Nash declares that this is the abyss of chaos that humans cannot reach (in the dub, Nash says the power of Chaos will leave Quattro quaking in fear; it is an unstoppable force of fury). Quattro says he has goosebumps just from looking at that monster (in the dub, Quattro remarks on the monster's tremendousness, making it all the sweeter to take down) and Nash tells that this is a real  Duel  now, urging Quattro to come at him.
 Each of the human Duelists utters a short comment.  Dextra  and  Bronk  only say "Over-Hundred Chaos Number" in shock (in the dub, Dextra is not afraid of Dumon's new "Number", while Bronk knows the real Rio is still in Marin and promises to bring her back), but  Nistro  is pleased his blood is pumping now.  Roku  says they still have to win, while  Kaze  is worried about being disgraced in this Duel (in the dub, Roku says it is the darkest before dawn, and Kaze finishes his mentor's statement with the sun coming up just as the Barians are going down).  Anna  says they can't afford to lose, while  Nelson  tells Mizar to bring it on (in the dub, Nelson promises to serve justice to Mizar, while Anna adds that this justice will be explosive). Still watching the Duel,  Vector  is shocked at Nash's power.  Don Thousand  tells him that such power was impossible to attain until now and seems surprised that Nash could pass that power to the other Emperors (Thousand communicating with Vector is cut from the dub). Vector muses that with power like that, they should be able to beat the humans even if they gang up on them, but wonders if Nash can truly fight his friend. 
 
       Nash  throws away his pendant, severing his link to humanity (this was removed from the dub).     
 Nash thinks back to just after he recovered his memories. Looking out at the abyss in the  Barian World , still in his human form, he stares at the picture inside the pendant he wears around his neck, showing his human family.  Rio  approaches him, calling him "Reginald". She comments he's come back to this spot again, but he tells her not to call him that anymore. She asks if she should call him "Nash" now. With tears in her eyes, she states that the souls that were sent to the Barian World were burned in the fires of war and carried the weight of anger and sorrow. She blames herself for it, or rather, her actions in her previous life. Nash in turn blames himself, as his hatred in that life led them here, while ripping the pendant from his neck. Rio wonders if he can really fight against  Yuma  and the others. He responds with a yell that he will - as Nash, he will force himself to forget his own friends. He throws the pendant into the abyss, yelling "for the sake of the Barian World!" (this entire flashback was removed from the dub version.) 
 Back in the present, Nash  activates  the effect of "Silent Honor DARK", which lets him  attach  a monster his opponent  controls  to it as a  Chaos Overlay Unit . Quattro comments that he doesn't even need to use an existing Overlay Unit to do this. Nash targets " Chaos Number 15: Gimmick Puppet Giant Hunter " and yells " Chaos Conversion " as "Silent Honor DARK" shoots a blast of pink energy from its lance, which engulfs "Giant Hunter" in a massive explosion, with the energy being brought back and made into a Chaos Overlay Unit. Nash boasts that this nonsense will end now and orders "Silent Honor DARK" to  attack   directly . It shoots another blast from its lance and Quattro is thrown backwards in the explosion. Nash says "Good-bye" as the attack hits. Vector remarks that Quattro lost quickly, but when the smoke clears, Quattro painfully gets to his feet. Quattro declares that he'll drag "Reginald" back no matter what. Even if he's accepted his fate, Quattro will beat sense into him. Nash asks how he survived and a monster appears in front of Quattro. He explains that when the attack of "Silent Honor DARK" was declared, he used the effect of the " Gimmick Puppet Shadow Feeler " in his Graveyard, Special Summoning it in  Attack Position  and making it the new  attack target , with "Shadow Feeler" preventing its own  destruction by battle . This reduced his  Life Points  to 100 - just enough to survive (shots of the actual "Shadow Feeler" are cut from the dub, though its silhouette is shown briefly).
 
         Quattro  is floored by Nash's declaration of having never felt bonds.     
 Nash says it wasn't a bad move, but it makes him want to destroy Quattro even more. He ends his  turn , commenting that he's surprised that the "cheating Champion of East Asia" was able to come this far. Quattro responds that he will keep going and reforge the bonds of friendship. Nash calls those bonds nonsense, adding that he's tired of pretending he was friends with anyone. Shocked, Quattro asks if he's serious, with Nash claiming that he was - he would never feel sentimental things such as bonds or friendship. He urges Quattro to hate him, to not think of him as a friend, but as an enemy he must defeat. Quattro responds that even if Nash believes the bonds of friendship are dead, he can still reforge them (in the dub, Quattro thinks Nash was telling the truth; he wasn't his friend in the past, but he will become the Barian leader's worst enemy in the present).
 
         " Overlay Satellite " duplicates " Gimmick Puppet Shadow Feeler ".     
 Quattro draws and then  equips  "Shadow Feeler" with " Overlay Satellite ". A small satellite appears and begins to orbit "Shadow Feeler". Quattro explains that this allows the equipped monster to be treated as two Overlay Units. The satellite fires a blast and "Shadow Feeler" is duplicated. Quattro overlays his two Level 8 monsters to  Xyz Summon  " Number 40: Gimmick Puppet of Strings " in Attack Position, adding that "Overlay Satellite" now becomes an Overlay Unit, but that the  Xyz Monster  cannot attack this turn. Nash questions why he'd Summon a 3000  ATK  monster that can't attack and adds that Quattro's words will never reach Nash's heart, no matter how loud they are (in the dub, Nash says he would never have a clueless person like Quattro as a friend). Quattro responds that he'll just have to make them echo so loudly that Nash will be forced to hear them, then. He activates the effect of "Strings",  detaching  an Overlay Unit to place a  String Counter  on all other monsters on the  field . Red strings rain down and snare "Silent Honor DARK" and he explains that monsters with String Counters will be destroyed during Nash's next  End Phase , inflicting  damage  to Nash equal to the destroyed monster's ATK. 
 
         Quattro recovers " Rank-Up-Magic Argent Chaos Force ".     
 He continues that "Shadow Feeler"  banishes  itself if it's detached and proceeds to activate " Banish Reactor " as one of his cards was banished. This lets him  add  a card from his Graveyard to his  hand . He chooses " Rank-Up-Magic Argent Chaos Force ". Nash quips that he wasted too much time and effort to bring back that "make-believe" Chaos card ("that phony meaningless card" in the dub). Quattro emphatically yells that this is a card his  older brother  entrusted him with, a card filled with the feelings of someone he believes in. He adds that even Nash should understand that and that he is pouring his heart and soul into this Duel. Nash questions why he's saying such strange things (in the dub, Quattro says that Dueling isn't about winning, and Nash points out that Quattro never believed in that concept back then) and Quattro reminds him that it was he and Yuma that turned him into such a person. Now, he wishes to return the favor and turn Nash back into the person he was before.
 
         " Chaos Number 40: Gimmick Puppet of Dark Strings " is Summoned.     
 As Quattro activates "Argent Chaos Force", his  crest  radiates outward and he declares a Chaos Xyz Evolution, his face contorting in pain. He chants, "using the fruits of human wisdom, I revive the Devil" and " Chaos Number 40: Gimmick Puppet of Dark Strings " appears in Attack Position. Quattro immediately activates its effect, which destroys all monsters that have String Counters. Nash asks "what did you say?", while Quattro declares " Symphony of Destruction ". "Gimmick Puppet of Dark Strings" fires a blast from its sword, which destroys "Silent Honor DARK" and Quattro reveals he'll take damage equal to the monster's ATK, determining that now his feelings will slap some sense back into Nash. As the explosion engulfs Nash, he's thrown backwards and reverts to his human form. He wonders to himself if these are truly Quattro's feelings before hitting the ground hard, his Life Points at 200 (Nash's thoughts are edited out in the dub). Quattro explains that the other effect of "Gimmick Puppet of Dark Strings" lets him draw a card whenever it destroys a monster. 
 
         Nash activates " Overlay Connection ".     
 Nash begins to rise, but wonders to himself again if Quattro's feelings are truly this strong (in the dub, Nash thinks that the angrier Quattro makes him, the harder he will hit back). Quattro speculates that since his body turned back to human form, Nash must have regained part of his heart. Nash rises and declares he's activating the effect of "Silent Honor DARK". When it is destroyed while it has Overlay Units, he can Special Summon it from his Graveyard. He shouts " Return from Oblivion " as "Silent Honor DARK" reappears and then explains that he now gains Life Points equal to the ATK of "Silent Honor DARK". A shining orb from the spear of "Silent Honor DARK" restores his Life Points to 3000. Quattro says he managed to pull himself back together, but adds that "Silent Honor DARK" has no Overlay Units now. He orders "Gimmick Puppet of Dark Strings" to attack, but Nash activates his  face-down  " Overlay Connection ", which lets him  attach  that card to an Xyz Monster he controls with no Overlay Units. "Gimmick Puppet of Dark Strings" fires a burst from its sword, destroying "Silent Honor DARK" and reducing Nash to 2500 Life Points. Quattro determines that his words didn't reach Nash, then and draws another card as "Gimmick Puppet of Dark Strings" destroyed a monster. Nash claims "Silent Honor DARK" can revive an infinite amount of times and declares "Return from Oblivion" again, reviving "Silent Honor DARK" and increasing his Life Points to 5300.
 
         Nash recalls the people he must protect.     
 Nash claims he is the "Barian's Guardian", the protector of a vast number of souls that have yet to mature (in the dub, Nash says as the Barian leader, the combined strength of the Barians is his). Behind him appear the members of the army of the  United Lands of the Poseidon Ocean , their eyes glowing pink. Nash urges Quattro to give up - his words will never reach Nash's heart. Quattro responds he'll never give up no matter how many Life Points Nash has and that he's sure that Nash is still Reginald Kastle, no matter what he looks like (in the dub, Quattro disregards Nash's claims and proves that Shark's human form is starting to get through to him; it must be the Dueling that is bringing Shark back). Nash growls and Quattro  Sets  a card. Nash draws and orders "Silent Honor DARK" to absorb "Gimmick Puppet of Dark Strings". As it appears as a Chaos Overlay Unit, Vector comments to himself that humanity's short-lived hope ends here - the next attack will send Quattro to hell. 
 
         Nash allows Quattro to see how his allies fare.     
 Quattro activates his face-down " Panic Shuffle " as his Xyz Monster was targeted by an opponent's card effect. It switches all monsters on the field to  Defense Position  and prevent them from switching again until the  End Phase . Then, all  Spell  and  Trap Cards  in both players' Graveyards will be returned to their respective Decks. Two Graveyard portals manifest and two yellow beams fire out of one into Nash's Deck, while six fire out of the other into Quattro's. Nash says he managed to stave off defeat a little longer and Sets a card to end his turn. Nash thinks to himself that even after throwing away his humanity, Quattro is still trying to reach him with his white-hot passion (in the dub, Nash thinks that now he is a Barian, he does not want to feel human again). His fist shaking, he thinks that he doesn't want that passion - he just wants Quattro to feel all-consuming hatred for him. Raising his arm, white energy discs radiate out from his hand and he tells Quattro that he wishes to show him something. Five screens appear in front of Quattro, where he can see the progress of the other Duels. Dextra vows that she can't give up yet as she gets to her feet. Bronk tells Yuma to wait for him - he will reforge his bonds with Rio (in the dub, Bronk says he is down, but not out just yet). Nistro tells Alito that no matter how many times he is punched, he will continue to rise for Yuma's sake (in the dub, Nistro promises to go all-out against his opponent). Kaze claims that even if their bodies perish, the "blades of their hearts" will never shatter (in the dub, Kaze says that even if his monsters are destroyed, his spirit will never be crushed). Roku agrees and says they'll protect Yuma even at the cost of their lives. Nelson claims that justice can never lose and Anna adds that love will always win and that she'll protect Yuma no matter what. Pointing at Mizar, she tells him to bring it on.
 
         Yuma  asks how his friends are faring.     
 In the car, Yuma finally regains consciousness, causing Tori to giggle happily. He struggles to speak and  Cathy  says she's glad to see he's alright. Yuma asks if everyone else is okay. Astral mutters his name, but  Caswell  perks up and claims that everyone is fine. Yuma mutters that he understands before closing his eyes again. Nash asks if Quattro is worried about what will become of his other friends and says that it is his "fanservice" to him (in the dub, Nash taunts Quattro by pointing out that his friends are failing miserably). A large energy blast hits Anna and Nelson, reducing them both to 0 Life Points. As "Neo Galaxy-Eyes Tachyon Dragon" vanishes, Mizar simply says "farewell." Anna apologizes to Yuma, while Nelson expresses shock that the "hero of justice" has lost (in the dub, Nelson mutters that the good guys do not always win). They both vanish and their souls fly towards the Barian World. Girag claims that no matter what his opponents do, they are helpless before "Giant Red Hand". Clasping his fist, he says he will crush them in the palm of his hand. A large fire attack hits both Roku and Kaze, with Kaze saying he has no regrets before vanishing. Roku apologizes to Yuma, disappointed that he won't see his apprentice grow up (in the dub, Kaze mutters, "I'm...done", while Roku begs Yuma to forgive him for his failure). Alito harshly tells Nistro to burn and suffer from the heat and boasts that his fists will burn him to pieces until the fires of malice reduce him to nothing (in the dub, Alito says it has been fun, but it's time to end the Duel). "Comet Cestus" fires a beam and Nistro is reduced to 0 Life Points. He says that the Duel was pretty exciting (in the dub, Nistro remarks that his temper got the better of him), but apologizes to Yuma for failing to pay the Barians back and repay his debt to Yuma. Dumon tells Dextra she fought well, but tells her to rest now as his attack blasts her backwards. 
 
         Quattro struggles against Nash even after the other Emperors have dispatched their opponents.      As she fades, she calls herself pathetic for being unable to stall longer (in the dub, she calls out that not only did she let Yuma down but herself before she vanishes). Marin tells Bronk that she acknowledges the feelings he sent her in this Duel, but calls them nothing more than a nuisance right now. Bronk curses, saying he had to win for Yuma's sake - he was supposed to return to Yuma with Rio at his side. As his soul flies towards the Barian World, tears stream down Marin's face. The screens vanish and Nash tells Quattro that every one of his friends has been defeated. Their bodies were crushed, twisted and broken, helpless before the overwhelming power of the Barians. Quattro simply hangs his head and Nash tells him that it's his turn. He asks if Quattro's heart has now broken (in the dub, Nash asks Quattro if he is still trying to change him, or if he has seen how wrong he was). Clenching his fist, Quattro angrily responds that he can scarcely believe how far Nash has fallen - to become this vile of a demon with a heart beyond saving. Nash thinks that this is a good sign and urges Quattro to hate him as a Barian. He believes that by defeating Quattro, he can bury the last link to "Reginald Kastle" (in the dub, Nash urges Quattro to make this a Duel neither of them can forget). Quattro mutters "Reginald", but finally yells that he's no longer Reginald Kastle (in the dub, Quattro declares that he lost an old friend, but gained a new enemy). Nash responds that he's right; he is Nash now. He urges Quattro to continue as his  Barian Emblem  glows and he resumes his Barian form. His voice adopting a demonic tone, he tells Quattro he'll join his friends in hell soon.
 Featured Duels 
 Nash vs. Quattro 
 Duel continues from  the previous episode .
 Turn 4: Nash 
 Nash  has just performed a Chaos Draw and has drawn " Rank-Up-Magic - The Seventh One ". Nash then activates "Rank-Up-Magic - The Seventh One" to revive " Number 101: Silent Honor ARK " (an " Over-Hundred Number ") ( 4/2100/1000) in Attack Position,  ignoring its Summoning conditions  and  negating  its  effects  (since it was Special Summoned from the Graveyard). Subsequently, Nash uses "Rank-Up-Magic - The Seventh One" to  Rank-Up  "Silent Honor ARK" via  Chaos Xyz Evolution  in order to Xyz Summon " Chaos Number 101: Silent Honor DARK " ( 5/2800/1500, ORU: 1) in  Attack Position . 
 Nash activates the third effect of "Silent Honor DARK" to attach " Chaos Number 15: Gimmick Puppet Giant Hunter " to "Silent Honor DARK" as an Overlay Unit ("Silent Honor DARK": 1 → 2 ORU). "Silent Honor DARK"  attacks   directly , but Quattro activates the effect of " Gimmick Puppet Shadow Feeler " to revive it ( 8/1000/1000) in Attack Position (as his opponent  declared  a direct attack) and make it the new attack target. Also "Gimmick Puppet Shadow Feeler" is not  destroyed by battle  due to its first effect (Quattro: 1900 → 100 LP).
 Turn 5: Quattro 
Quattro draws "Banish Reactor". He then  equips  "Gimmick Puppet Shadow Feeler" with " Overlay Satellite ", whose effect allows the equipped monster to be treated as two monsters when it is used for an Xyz Summon. Quattro then overlays "Gimmick Puppet Shadow Feeler" with itself in order to Xyz Summon " Number 40: Gimmick Puppet of Strings " ( 8/3000/2000, ORU: 1) in Attack Position. As the monster equipped with "Overlay Satellite" was used for an Xyz Summon, the second effect of "Overlay Satellite" allows it to become an Overlay Unit for "Gimmick Puppet of Strings" (the summoned monster) ("Gimmick Puppet of Strings": 1 → 2 ORU), but it is forbidden from attacking this turn. Quattro then activates the effect of "Gimmick Puppet of Strings" to detach "Gimmick Puppet Shadow Feeler" ("Gimmick Puppet of Strings": 2 → 1 ORU) and place a  String Counter  on "Silent Honor DARK". Since "Gimmick Puppet Shadow Feeler" was used as an Overlay Unit and was  sent  to the Graveyard, it is  banished  via its last effect. As a card in his  possession  was banished, Quattro activates " Banish Reactor " to  add  " Rank-Up-Magic Argent Chaos Force " (a  Spell Card ) from his Graveyard to his hand. 
 
         " Chaos Number 101: Silent Honor DARK " about to be  destroyed  by " Chaos Number 40: Gimmick Puppet of Dark Strings " due to its  String Counter .     
 Quattro activates "Rank-Up-Magic Argent Chaos Force" to Rank-Up "Gimmick Puppet of Strings" via Chaos Xyz Evolution in order to Xyz Summon " Chaos Number 40: Gimmick Puppet of Dark Strings " ( 9/3300/2000, ORU: 2) in Attack Position. He then activates the last effect of "Gimmick Puppet of Dark Strings" to destroy all monsters on the field with String Counters and inflict damage to the destroyed monsters'  controllers  equal to the combined  original ATK  of each of their destroyed monsters; "Silent Honor DARK" is destroyed (Nash: 3000 → 200 LP). Quattro activates the second effect of "Gimmick Puppet of Dark Strings" to  draw a card  since it destroyed a monster (which can be done either by battle or by its effect). As "Silent Honor DARK" was destroyed and sent to the Graveyard while it had Overlay Units, Nash activates its second effect to revive it ( 5/2800/1500) in Attack Position and gain  Life Points  equal to its original ATK (Nash: 200 → 3000 LP). 
 "Gimmick Puppet of Dark Strings" attacks "Silent Honor DARK", but Nash activates his face-down " Overlay Connection " to target "Silent Honor DARK" (an Xyz Monster Nash controls that has no Overlay Units) and  attach  "Overlay Connection" to that target as an Overlay Unit ("Silent Honor DARK": 0 → 1 ORU). "Gimmick Puppet of Dark Strings" then destroys "Silent Honor DARK" (Nash: 3000 → 2500 LP). The second effect of "Gimmick Puppet of Dark Strings" activates and Quattro draws a card. Nash activates the second effect of "Silent Honor DARK" to revive it ( 5/2800/1500) in Attack Position (Nash: 2500 → 5300 LP). Quattro  Sets  a card.
 
         " Panic Shuffle " returns the used  Spell  and  Trap Cards  to the  Decks .     
 Turn 6: Nash 
Nash draws " Overlay Award ". He then activates the third effect of "Silent Honor DARK" and attaches "Gimmick Puppet of Dark Strings" to it as an Overlay Unit ("Silent Honor DARK": 0 → 1 ORU). As a face-up Xyz Monster Quattro controlled was targeted by an opponent's card effect, Quattro activates his face-down " Panic Shuffle " to change all Attack Position monsters to  Defense Position  and  shuffle  all Spell and  Trap Cards  in both players' Graveyards into their  Decks . The  battle positions  of the affected monsters may not be changed until the  End Phase . Nash Sets a card.

 Trivia 
 Almost every time the  Seven Barian Emperors  are shown one at a time, the order is the same as their " Over-Hundred Numbers " or reversed (though  Vector  is often left out since he wasn't Dueling) with an occasional switch involving  Marin . 
 When multiple "Over-Hundred Numbers" were shown simultaneously, " Number 107: Galaxy-Eyes Tachyon Dragon " is depicted as if it is horizontally mirrored.
