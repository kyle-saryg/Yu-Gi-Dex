 Summary 
       The Diablo invading the streets.     
 Battle Royal 
       Turbo Dueling system changed into the Battle Royal Mode ("Battle Royal Mode" and the yellow star are removed from the screens in the dub)     
 After Jack's victory over Team Catastrophe, Primo's  Diablo  army begins to infiltrate and disperse themselves on the highway where the duels from the  WRGP  are taking place. Some of the robots arrive at the site where  Team White Tiger  is dueling against  Team Lightning ; they surround the White Tiger duelist and announce that they’ll join the duel. The system is automatically changed into  Battle Royal  Mode as the Diablo attack; two of them easily defeat the Team White Tiger member, while another defeats the Team Lightning member.
 Watching the carnage from above, Primo states that the WRGP tournament has been changed into Battle Royal Mode. He implies that the Turbo Duelists' fates are at stake in these duels; if they want to live, they had better complete the  Grand Design .
 Back at the stadium, the MC announces to everyone about crashes occurring on the Highway during duels.  Mina  and  Trudge  investigate what’s going on; as  Yusei  and the others arrive, a  Sector Security  operator tells  Trudge  that the Highway’s Turbo Dueling system has been changed into Battle Royal Mode. He also says that there’s a strange signal which he tries to identify. Upon determining its location,  Yusei  and the others are shocked to see that the signal comes from Ghost.
 At that moment,  Sherry  and  Elsworth  arrive. Yusei says that  Ghost  has appeared again, and  Bruno  states that the army of Ghosts can only mean that  Iliaster  is trying to destroy the tournament. Yusei then proposes that everyone fight together against the Diablo army - hopefully, they can find the individual who is controlling them before they're overwhelmed by sheer numbers.  Sherry  and  Elsworth  agree to help Team 5D's - suddenly,  Kaz  appears and offers his support as well. Trudge warns them to be careful - in  Battle Royal  mode, anyone can attack anyone, and the Diablo seem to be using that to their advantage. Yusei also adds that in a duel against Ghost, the players will suffer real  damage ; they can’t afford to take the situation lightly.
 As Yusei and his allies head for the Highway,  Jakob  observes some parts of the Grand Design lighting up.  Lester  then appears, stating that completing the Circuit is troublesome;  Jakob  states that they need the  Ener-D ’s strength for that, even though the world doesn't understand the true power of the  Duel Runner  and its energy source. He notes that when the Circuit is finally completed, the location of a  God  shall be revealed. Lester says that the Circuit itself is as big as  New Domino City ; when it completes itself, the city will be destroyed. Jakob says that it is a small sacrifice on their path to save the future.
 At that moment, images of Ghosts appear, which Lester calls the Diablo. Jakob identifies them as being the robots that Primo created, and Lester reveals that their companion unleashed them to do something big. Jakob scowls as he wonders what Primo is thinking.
 
 Stopping the Diablo 
       Yusei ,  Sherry  and  Elsworth  teaming up to stop the  Ghost .     
 Back at the Highway, 3 Diablo robots are trying to defeat a female Duelist. One of them tries to  attack  her directly with  Nullfier , but  Swift Scarecrow  blocks the attack.
 The Ghosts are surprised as Yusei, Sherry and Elsworth arrive. At Yusei's suggestion, the female turbo duelist drops out from the Duel as he  summons   Stardust Dragon  to defeat one of the Ghosts.
 At another location, a Diablo attacks another Duelist directly with  Clausolas  when Kaz and Jack both appear. As Kaz directs the damage towards him with his  Battle Eater , Jack proceeds to assault the Ghost with  Red Dragon Archfiend , inflicting major damage.
 At the stadium,  Leo and Luna  are left to convince a fired-up  Crow  not to risk joining the battle. Leo reminds Crow that he's still injured from his duel with Team Catastrophe; Luna nags him because in that shape, Crow will just get in the way.
 Back at the Highway, Primo notices that 4 more Diablo units were defeated. As he wonders if Yusei is behind this, Jakob appears and demands to know what he thinks he is doing. Primo replies that he isn’t satisfied with Jakob’s methods of completing the Circuit - instead, he is forcing duels tol speed up the process. Jakob counters that the Diablo assault will not bring out the duelists' potential, which means that the Circuit can’t be truly completed.
 Lester shows up to tell Primo to listen to Jakob: the one who stands in his way is Yusei, and Primo  already lost to  him. Aggravated by this, Primo cuts the conversation, stating that he will show Yusei that he can’t win against him.
 
 The Diablo's onslaught 
           
 At another location, Jack and Kaz are facing 4 Diablo units when the robots suddenly break off and head into other riding lanes. At the stadium, Mina and Trudge notice that every Ghost is acting strangely: they are all moving towards one sole point.
 Back at the Highway, Yusei defeats another robot with "Stardust Dragon". Thinking that it’s over soon, Yusei, Sherry and Elsworth discover that various Ghosts are after them. It is revealed that Primo specifically ordered the Diablo army to target the trio as the primary threats to his plan.
 An Infinity symbol appearing beneath the road as one of the Diablo commences a Duel. Yusei warns Sherry and Elsworth to be careful, as the Duelbot has forced the duel on them.
 
Working together, the trio successfully defeat 2 of the robotic riders. However, the Diablo prove relentless, slowly forcing Yusei, Sherry, and Elsworth into a corner by building on each other's turns. Soon, Elsworth has been defeated by a trio of  Cosmic Gateways . Sherry is the army's next  target ; one destroys her  chevalier de Fleur  with a combination of  Ally Salvo  and  DNA Transplant , then the others attack her directly with their own Ally Salvos.           
 With Sherry gone, Yusei is left all alone to fight the horde of robots.

 Ghost 2's turn 
Ghost 2 draws " Ally of Justice Garadholg " and subsequently Normal Summons it ( 4/1600/400) in  Attack Position . Ghost 1  activates  his face-down " Release & Reverse " to  Tribute  "Ally of Justice Nullfier" and take damage equal to its  ATK  (Ghost 1 4000 → 2400) as well as  Special Summon  "Ally of Justice Nullfier" ( 4/1600/1200) to Ghost 2's side of the field in Attack Position. 
 Ghost 2 uses "Ally of Justice Nullfier" and "Ally of Justice Garadholg" to attack the  Team White Tiger  duelist directly, but the  Team White Tiger  duelist activates his face-down " Negate Attack " to negate the attack and end the Battle Phase, however Ghost 1 activates his face-down " Solemn Judgment " to negate "Negate Attack" and destroy it by paying half his Life Points (Ghost 1 2400 → 1200). The direct attack continues (Team White Tiger Duelist 2500 → 900 → 0).

 The rest of the duel is skipped, but the  Team Lightning  Duelist loses.
 
 Team White Wind Duelist vs. 3 Ghosts vs. Yusei, Sherry and Elsworth

 By Yusei's request, the Team White Wind Duelist drops out.
 Yusei's turn 
Yusei draws " Junk Synchron " and subsequently Normal Summons it ( 3/1300/500) in Attack Position. Yusei then activates the effect of "Junk Synchron" to Special Summon "Swift Scarecrow" ( 1/0/0) from his  Graveyard  in Defense Position with its effects negated. Yusei then Special Summons " Mirror Ladybug " ( 1/100/100) from his  hand  in Attack Position (as Yusei controls at least one face-up monster and has no monsters in his Graveyard).
 Yusei then activates the effect of "Mirror Ladybug" to make its Level equal to the total Levels of all other monsters Yusei controls ("Mirror Ladybug":   1 → 4). Yusei then tunes "Swift Scarecrow" and "Mirror Ladybug" with "Junk Synchron" in order to  Synchro Summon  " Stardust Dragon " ( 8/2500/2000) in Attack Position. Stardust Dragon attacks and destroys "Ally of Justice Nullifier" (Ghost 3 900 → 0).
 The rest of the duel is skipped, but Yusei, Sherry and Elsworth win.
 
 Team Burning Duelist vs. Ghost vs. Jack and Kaz 
 The beginning of the Duel is skipped. Ghost has " Ally of Justice Clausolas " ( 6/2300/1200) in Attack Position and one set card. 
 Ghost's turn 
"Ally of Justice Clausolas" attacks the  Team Burning  Duelist directly, but Kaz sends " Battle Eater " from his hand to the Graveyard in order to negate the attack and end the Battle Phase as well as take damage equal to the ATK of "Battle Eater" (Kaz 4000 → 1500).
 Jack's turn

He then sends Ghost's " DNA Surgery " to the Graveyard in order to Special Summon " Trap Eater " ( 4/1900/1600) in Attack Position. Jack then tunes "Vice Berserker" with "Trap Eater" in order to Synchro Summon " Red Dragon Archfiend " ( 8/3000/2000) in Attack Position. 
 Since "Vice Berserker" was sent to the Graveyard for a Synchro Summon, its effect activates, inflicting 2000 damage to Jack (Jack 4000 → 2000) and increasing the ATK of "Red Dragon Archfiend" by 2000 ("Red Dragon Archfiend": 3000 → 5000/2000).

Jack's hand contains " Twin-Sword Marauder ", " Fiendish Chain ", " Battle Fader " and " Sword Master ".
 After a while, Ghost drops out of the Duel, so Jack and Kaz win.

"Driven Daredevil" attacks and destroys "Ally of Justice Garadholg" (Ghost 1 4000 → 3200).
 Turn 3: Sherry 
Sherry draws " Speed Spell - Overboost " and subsequently activates it, increasing her  Speed Counters  by four (Sherry's SPC: 2 → 6).

 Sherry then  Normal Summons  " Fleur Synchron " ( 2/400/200) in Attack Position. She then tunes "Centaur Mina" with "Fleur Synchron" in order to Synchro Summon " Chevalier de Fleur " ( 8/2700/2300) in Attack Position. "Chevalier de Fleur" attacks Ghost 1 directly (Ghost 1 3200 → 500). On Sherry's End Phase, the final effect of "Speed Spell - Overboost" reduces Sherry's SPC to 1 (Sherry's SPC: 6 → 1).
 Turn 4: Yusei

Yusei then activates the effect of "Quillbolt Hedgehog" to Special Summon itself ( 2/800/800) from the Graveyard in Attack Position. Since Yusei's opponents control Synchro Monsters and he doesn't, Yusei Special Summons " Reed Butterfly " ( 1/300/600) from his hand in Attack Position.

 Turn 5: Ghost 2 
Ghost 2's hand contains "Ally of Justice Comsic Gateway", "DNA Transplant", "DNA Surgery", "Ally of Justice Garadholg", and "Ally Salvo". Ghost 2 draws. Yusei activates his face-down " Synchro Prominence " to inflict 1000 damage to the opponent for each Synchro Monster on the Field. There are three (Ghost 1 500 → 0; Ghost 2 3100 → 2100; Ghost 3 1000 → 0). Ghost 2 Normal Summons " Ally of Justice Tractor " ( 1/0/0) in Attack Position.

 Ghost 2 then Special Summons three " Ally of Justice Cosmic Gateways " ( 8/2400/1200 for all) in Attack Position as his opponents control at least two monsters (including a  LIGHT  monster). One "Ally of Justice Cosmic Gateway" attacks Elsworth's "Driven Daredevil". Both monsters are then destroyed in a  Double KO . The remaining two "Cosmic Gateways" attack Elsworth directly (Elsworth 4000 → 1600 → 0). Ghost 2 sets a card.
 Turn 6: Ghost 4 
Ghost 4 draws. Ghost 2 activates his face-down " DNA Transplant " and declares LIGHT for its effect. Now all monsters on the field become the declared attribute. Ghost 4 then Normal Summons " Ally Salvo " ( 2/400/300) in Attack Position. "Ally Salvo" attacks "Chevalier de Fleur". "Chevalier de Fleur" destroys "Ally Salvo" (Ghost 4 4000 → 1700). The effect of "Ally Salvo" activates, allowing Ghost 4 to destroy "Chevalier de Fleur" and Yusei's "Speed Warrior".
 Turn 7-16: The rest of the Ghosts 
The rest of the Ghosts each Normal Summon "Ally Salvo" ( 2/400/300 for all) in Attack Position. The summoned "Ally Salvos" all attack Sherry directly (Sherry 4000 → 3600 → 3200 → 2800 → 2400 → 2000 → 1600 → 1200 → 800 → 400 → 0).
 
 Continued next episode... 
 Mistakes 
 " Speed Warrior  and " Road Fighter " still appear on the field after they were destroyed by the effect of " Ally Salvo ". This was on the DVD version of the episode and in the dub, in the original airing, Road Warrior isn't present, but Speed Warrior wasn't there either. 
 In the English version, when the  Ghost  that plays " Release & Reverse " uses its effect to tribute " Ally of Justice Nullfier " for its effect, he mistakenly says he is tributing " Ally of Justice Garadholg " for its effect. This is an error because if he tributed "Ally of Justice Garadholg" then he wouldn't have any monsters on his field to attack with. 
 When Yusei summoned " Swift Scarecrow " via the effect of " Junk Synchron ", it was summoned in Attack Position instead of Defense Position. 
 When Sherry and Elsworth arrive at the car park where Officer Trudge is discussing the highway disruptions with the others, Elsworth is on Sherry's left. When Kaz arrives, Elsworth and his Duel Runner are seen on Sherry and her Runner's right. This mistake was corrected on the Japanese DVD version of the episode and in the dub. 
 When  Kaz  got hit by " Ally of Justice Clausolas ", his life points went down to 1500 instead of 1700, since the attack of "Ally of Justice Clausolas" is 2300. 
 In the dub, Yusei says "Road Fighter" instead of "Road Warrior". However, he did the same in  episode 45 , this is to prevent any copyright to  Road warrior . 
 In the English dub, after Yusei summons " Quickdraw Synchron " and activates the effect of " Quillbolt Hedgehog ", the original Japanese card for the latter can be seen in his hand rather than the dub's design.
