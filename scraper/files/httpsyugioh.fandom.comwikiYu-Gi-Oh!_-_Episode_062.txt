 Major Events 
 Yami Yugi  summons " Dark Magician Girl " for the first time. With extra attack points from the " Dark Magicians " in both players' graveyard,  Arkana 's second "Dark Magician" is beaten, and Yugi wins. 
 Arkana tries to use a hidden key to break himself out. However,  Marik  plays tricks on his mind using his Millennium Rod (making it look as though Arkana didn’t have the key in his hand). Yami Yugi turns back into  Yugi , who breaks himself and Arkana out of their locks. 
 Marik speaks to Yugi through Arkana and tells him of his motives and plans. Just afterwards,  Téa ,  Solomon Muto ,  Mokuba  and  Tristan  find Yugi. 
 Featured Duel: Yami Yugi vs. Arkana, Part 3 
 Duel continued from previous episode. 
 Yami Yugi  has 700  LP  remaining and  controls  " Big Shield Gardna " (100/2600) in Defense Position and two set cards.
 Arkana  has 1500 LP remaining and controls no cards.
 Turn 16: Arkana 
 Arkana   Sets  a card.
 Turn 17: Yami Yugi 
 Yami Yugi  draws. He then  Normal Summons  " Gazelle the King of Mythical Beasts " (1500/1200) in  Attack Position .  Arkana  then  activates  his face-down " Shadow Balance " to  destroy   Yami Yugi 's  monsters  until he and Arkana has the same number of monsters. Since there are no  monsters  on  Arkana 's side of the  field , the effect of " Shadow Balance "  destroys  both "Gazelle the King of Mythical Beasts" and " Big Shield Gardna ".
 Turn 18: Arkana 
 Arkana  draws. He then  activates  " Dark Magic Curtain " to  pay  half his  Life Points  ( Arkana  1500 → 750) and  Special Summon  a " Dark Magician " from his Deck (2500/2100) in  Attack Position . He then  activates  " Anti-Magic Arrows " to prevent  Yami Yugi  from  activating  his  Set  cards. 
 Arkana 's " Dark Magician "  attacks  directly, but  Yami Yugi   activates  the effect of " Dark Magic Curtain " to  pay  half his  Life Points  ( Yami  700 → 350) and  Special Summon  " Dark Magician Girl " (2000/1700) in  Attack Position . Yami Yugi states that due to the effect of "Dark Magician Girl", it gains 300 ATK for each "Dark Magician" in the Graveyard. 
 A replay occurs, and Arkana, knowing that Yami Yugi has only one "Dark Magician" in his Graveyard (which would make the ATK of "Dark Magician Girl" 2300), uses his "Dark Magician" to attack "Dark Magician Girl". However, Yami Yugi then reminds Arkana that "Dark Magician Girl" gains ATK from "Dark Magicians" in  both  players' Graveyards ("Dark Magician Girl": 2000 → 2600/1700). "Dark Magician Girl" then destroys Arkana's "Dark Magician" ( Arkana  750 → 650) ("Dark Magician Girl": 2600 → 2900/1700).
 Turn 19: Yami Yugi 
"Dark Magician Girl"  attacks  directly ( Arkana  650 → 0).
 
 Changes to the dub 
 The pentagram of "Dark Magic Curtain" is given five more points. 
 The pentagram of "Dark Magician Girl" is changed to a red jewel. Also, a blue skirt is temporarily added to her costume at one point to conceal her thigh. 
 Marik explaining his family's past is cut. 
 A frame of Yugi with the three God cards behind him is cut. 
 The buzzsaw glows blue and its blades are obscured, to match the dub's depiction of them as "Dark Energy Disks". 
 A shot of the buzzsaw nearing dangerously close to Pandora/Arkana's leg is cut. 
 In the original, Marik wants to kill Yugi. In the dub, he wants to send him to the Shadow Realm. 
 The original Japanese version has Marik introduce himself, while the English dub did it much earlier. 
 Errors 
 From a close-up near the episode's beginning, the buzzsaw near Yami Yugi has its right side close to the number 1000, but the next view of the saw, from far-away, shows its left side closest to the number and the right side touching the vertical line that means 500 life points. Then the next close-up shows it as the first view again. 
 When Arkana places "Shadow Balance" on the field, he calls it a  Monster , when in fact "Shadow Balance" is a  Trap . 
 When "Gazelle the King of Mythical Beasts" is summoned, it's shown with three claws on its front paws. However, just before "Shadow Balance" "swallows" "Gazelle", it has four claws on its front paws, then back to three just moments before it's destroyed. 
 When Gazelle and Big Shield Gardna are first put into Shadow Balance's trays, they're both in the same tray but when they're destroyed, they're each in individual trays.
