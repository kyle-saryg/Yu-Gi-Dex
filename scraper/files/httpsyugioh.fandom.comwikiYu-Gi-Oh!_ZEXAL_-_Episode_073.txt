 " Kite's Plight: Part 2 ", known as " Impossible Great Clash!! Double Hope vs. Double Galaxy-Eyes!! " in the Japanese version, is the seventy-third episode of the  Yu-Gi-Oh! ZEXAL  anime and the last before the change to  Yu-Gi-Oh! ZEXAL II . It first aired in Japan on September 24, 2012, and in the United States on August 10, 2013.
 Yuma  unleashes the conflict dwelling deep inside  Kite 's heart. The two clash so hard and fierce and neither has a moment to catch their breath, as they Summon their ace monsters. At the end of a tight battle, Kite emerges the victor, finding new purpose in Dueling, while Yuma is content with the loss, but eager to try again someday.
 
 Summary 
 Staring down " Number 39: Utopia ",  Kite  tells  Yuma  he'll regret waking the sleeping lion (in the dub, Kite tells Yuma that he'll regret talking him back into the Duel). Yuma says that's just what he wanted to do and Kite  draws . He  activates  " Card of Adversity ", letting him draw two cards since he  controls  no  monsters  and his opponent controls  Special Summoned  monsters. He then activates " Accellight ", revealing that instead of  Normal Summoning  or  Setting  a monster this  turn , he can Special Summon a  Level  4 or lower  LIGHT   Warrior - Type  monster from his  Deck . He Special Summons " Daybreaker " in  Attack Position .  Astral  urges Yuma to be careful and Kite tells them that when "Daybreaker" is Special Summoned, he can Special Summon another copy from his  hand . 
 
       " Starliege Paladynamo "  destroys  " Number 39: Utopia ".     
 He does so and proceeds to  overlay  his two Level 4 monsters to  Xyz Summon  " Starliege Paladynamo " in Attack Position. Astral and Yuma agree that Kite's counterattack is coming now. Kite activates the  effect  of "Paladynamo",  detaching  an  Overlay Unit  to decrease the  ATK  of "Utopia" to 0 until the  End Phase  and  negate  the effects of all  face-up  cards besides "Paladynamo". Yuma says that means the effects of "Utopia" and " Zerozerock " are negated. Kite says that's right and due to that, "Utopia" can be destroyed by battle, even though it's a " Number ". "Paladynamo"  attacks  and destroys "Utopia" with " Photon Dividing ", launching a red energy ball from its sword. Yuma is blown backwards, his  Life Points  falling to 500. Kite smirks and ends his  turn .
 
       " Gagaga Clerk " and " Gagaga Caesar ".     
 Yuma rises to his feet and Astral says that was expected of Kite, with Yuma responding that it wouldn't be interesting if that wasn't the case. He calls it a good "wall" for " kattobingu ". Kite tells him that unfortunately for him, it's not a brittle wall, so Yuma won't be able to bear down on it. Yuma insists he will. He draws and activates " Card of Spell Containment "; in exchange for being unable to activate or Set  Spell  and  Trap Cards  this turn, he can draw two cards. Excited, he draws " Gagaga Clerk " and " Gagaga Caesar ". He Normal Summons "Caesar" and reveals that if he controls another " Gagaga " monster, he can Special Summon "Clerk" from his hand via its own effect. He activates the effect of "Caesar". By  banishing  a monster from his  Graveyard , he can change the Levels of all monsters he controls to that Level until the End Phase. He banishes the Level 4 " Ganbara Knight ", so the Levels of "Kaiser" and "Clerk" become 4. 
 Bronk  says there are two Level 4 monsters now, with  Flip  adding that he has a chance now.  Cathy  tells him "cattobingu" and  Tori  yells "Go, Yuma!". He overlays his two Level 4 monsters to Xyz Summon " Heroic Champion - Excalibur " in Attack Position.  Nistro  is excited that Yuma is using the card he gave to him and tells Yuma to use it to pack a punch.  Dextra  asks him whose side he's on (this scene is cut from the dub). Yuma attacks "Paladynamo" with "Excalibur". Both Flip and  Caswell  are puzzled, as the two monsters have the same ATK. Yuma activates the effect of "Excalibur", detaching all of its Overlay Units to double its ATK to 4000 until the End Phase. Kite is surprised and Yuma yells " Double Shock Sword Slash !" "Paladynamo" is cleaved in half and explodes, knocking Kite back. Dextra and  Orbital 7  both yell Kite's name as his Life Points fall to 200. He rises to his feet and reveals that when "Paladynamo" is destroyed, he can draw a card (Kite does not mention this effect in the dub; instead, he says that Yuma and Astral will have to do more than destroying "Paladynamo" if they want to win). Yuma ends his turn, the ATK of "Excalibur" returning to 2000.
 
       Dr. Faker  and  Hart  watch on.     
 Astral mutters Kite's name, while Flip and Caswell agree that was an amazing play (in the dub, Flip says that while Yuma may have ended his turn, he still has doubts on his winning chances). Cathy says her throat is burning (feeling the chills in the dub), but Tori says they are having fun - even Kite is enjoying himself.  Hart  says his brother is smiling - he's happy, from the bottom of his heart.  Dr. Faker  wonders if  Kazuma 's son will end up helping his own. Kite draws and activates " Galaxy Zero ", letting him Special Summon a " Galaxy-Eyes " monster from his Graveyard. Its effects will negated and it will be  equipped  with "Galaxy Zero". He Special Summons " Galaxy-Eyes Photon Dragon ". Yuma is excited to see "Galaxy-Eyes" and Kite adds that a monster equipped with "Galaxy Zero" will lose 800 ATK when is battles. Nistro mutters that it still has more ATK than "Exaclibur" then and Dextra yells "Go, Kite!" (in the dub, Nistro still believes that Yuma can gain the upper hand, with Dextra retorting with, "You wish!"). 
 
         " Heroic Champion - Excalibur " vs. " Galaxy-Eyes Photon Dragon ".     
 "Galaxy-Eyes" attacks and destroys "Excalibur" with " Photon Stream of Destruction ", reducing Yuma to 300 Life Points. As he hits the ground, Tori yells his name. With the battle over, the ATK of "Galaxy-Eyes" returns to normal. Kite Sets a card. Yuma backflips to his feet and says it's not over - he can still fight. Kite tells him to do as he wishes and Yuma draws. He activates " Gagagadraw ", letting him banish three "Gagaga" monsters from his Graveyard to draw two cards. He banishes "Gagaga Caesar", "Gagaga Clerk" and " Gagaga Magician ", which shoot from the Graveyard as energy beams into Yuma's  D-Pad . He activates " Xyz Revival ", letting him Special Summon an Xyz Monster from his Graveyard and equip it with that card. Kite tells Yuma to show him all he has - he will crush it regardless. Yuma says that's what he was going to say (in the dub, Yuma asks Kite if he's scared, but Kite calls Yuma's play very predictable, with Yuma responding that he uses what works for him).
 
         " Number C39: Utopia Ray " attacks "Galaxy-Eyes".     
 Yuma Special Summons "Utopia" with "Xyz Revival". Kite says it will fall short to "Galaxy-Eyes", but Yuma says they'll see about that. Yuma performs a  Chaos Xyz Evolution , overlaying "Utopia" to Xyz Summon " Number C39: Utopia Ray " in Attack Position. Kite mutters "hope" (the  OCG  name of "Utopia" is "Hope") and tells Astral that he once told him he no longer has to be tied to his past. Astral says that's right and Kite says that his Duel was always a Duel of a vow. Yuma asks what he means and Kite says he Dueled to save Hart. Hart mutters "brother..." and Kite continues that from now on, he'll Duel for himself. Looking at "Utopia Ray", he says "wishes, hope". Yuma says that's right - the future belongs to them and they will decide it. Faker mutters Kite's name and Hart says he'll live the same way (This entire conversation is cut from the dub). 
 Kite tells Yuma to come at him and Yuma activates the effect of "Utopia Ray", detaching an Overlay Unit to increase its ATK by 500 and decrease the ATK of "Galaxy-Eyes" by 1000 with " Overlay Charge ". The 3000 ATK "Utopia Ray" attacks the 2000 ATK "Galaxy-Eyes" with " Rising Sun Chaos Slash ". Kite activates the effect of "Galaxy Zero", preventing the destruction of "Galaxy-Eyes"  by battle  since it was  sent  to the Graveyard. Yuma says he'll still receive the  Battle Damage , but as the smoke clears Kite stands with 200 Life Points. Yuma is confused and Kite reveals that "Galaxy Zero" has another effect. When it leaves the field, the ATK of the monster it was equipped to falls to zero, with Kite reminding Yuma about one of his own cards. Astral says it was the effect of Yuma's own "Zerozerock".
 
         " Dimension Gate " saves  Yuma .     
 Yuma curses and Kite says that "Galaxy-Eyes" can't be an attack target since it has zero ATK. He adds that since the attack did not technically take place, the effect of " Battle Gravity " will do Yuma in now. Yuma activates his face-down " Dimension Gate ", banishing "Utopia Ray". Since he had no monsters, he could not attack with them, so "Battle Gravity" does not activate. Nistro says both players are in a good "mood" (he compliments on Yuma's play in the dub) and Dextra mutters Kite's name. Orbital tells Kite not to lose to "this dork". Bronk thinks this is an awesome Duel and Tori says they both keep moving forward, towards the hope that lies ahead. Yuma Sets a card and ends his turn.
 Astral compliments Yuma, saying he's really improved and that his spirit of "kattobingu" is really great. He says he can be on his own. Yuma says he can't - "kattobingu" is made up of Yuma and Astral (in the dub, Yuma says he Duels the way he does right now because of Astral). Yuma suggests they advance together, forever. Astral tells him they can start by winning. Kite addresses them both, insisting that he'll be the victor. Kite draws and Normal Summons " Galaxy Wizard ", whose own effect doubles its Level, to 8 and it can be treated as two Overlay Units. Kite overlays his two (treated as three) Level 8 monsters to Xyz Summon " Neo Galaxy-Eyes Photon Dragon " in Attack Position. Kite reveals that because it used "Galaxy Wizard" as an Overlay Unit, its ATK decreases by 2000, to 2500. He specifies that it should still be enough - Yuma's Life Points are 300. 
 
         "Utopia" and " Utopia Ray ".      He declares a  direct attack  with " Ultimate Photon Stream of Destruction ". Hart says that means his brother wins and Tori yells Yuma's name. Yuma activates another effect of "Dimension Gate", sending it to the Graveyard to Special Summon the banished monster, with its effect negated. Yuma tells "Utopia Ray" to revive. It bursts from the ground and Yuma says that its ATK is the same as that of "Neo Galaxy-Eyes - both monsters will be destroyed. Astral tells Yuma that now is the time. Yelling "kattobingu!", he activates his face-down " Xyz Double Back " (in the dub, he yells "I am feelin' the flow" and a scene of Yuma drawing "Gagaga Clerk" and "Gagaga Caesar" was added before he activates "Xyz Double Back"). When an Xyz Monster is destroyed and he controls no other monsters, he can Special Summon the destroyed Xyz Monster and another monster with equal to or less ATK. "Utopia" and "Utopia Ray" both descend to the field as lightning strikes, appearing in Attack Position. 
         " Neo Galaxy-Eyes " and "Galaxy-Eyes".     
 Yuma's friends are all excited and Nistro wonders if its been decided now. Dextra says Kite's name again. Tori says its amazing to see "Utopia" and "Utopia Ray" side-by-side. Astral says that in the next turn, victory will be theirs. Lightning strikes Kite's field and both "Galaxy-Eyes" and "Neo Galaxy-Eyes" appear. Astral and Yuma can't believe it - a copy of "Xyz Double Back" is face-up on Kite's field. Yuma asks if he really had the same card as him and Orbital says Kite has done it now. He calls Yuma "Tonma" and says that "kattobingu" is no match for "kaitobingu". Kite congratulates Yuma and Astral for their Dueling skills, but adds that there can only be one winner and that winner will be himself. He orders "Galaxy-Eyes" and "Neo Galaxy-Eyes" to attack "Utopia" and "Utopia Ray" respectively, yelling "Photon Stream of Destruction" and "Ultimate Photon Stream of Destruction". Yuma's Life Points fall to zero. 
 
         Kite offers Yuma his hand.      Yuma mutters that it hurts to lose. Kite walks over to him and extends his hand, helping him to his feet. Yuma promises he'll beat Kite next time and Kite says he'll be Yuma's opponent as often as Yuma likes (in the dub, Kite says that he will face Yuma again anytime, but he must improve first). Yuma says that if he keeps working and doesn't give up, he can surpass Kite someday (in the dub, Yuma exclaims that he is the World Duel Carnival champion, and didn't remember seeing Kite in the finals, but he is already looking forward to their next Duel). Kite smiles as he walks away and departs on Orbital. Yuma's friends run to him and Yuma falls over into Tori's arms. She kneels down and everyone seems concerned until they hear him snoring. Hart thanks both his brother and Yuma and Faker smiles. Nistro and Dextra leave, with Nistro saying it was a good Duel, muttering "bye, Yuma." (in the dub, Nistro comments that Yuma improved significantly) On a walkway nearby,  Shark  smiles, his chest heavily bandaged from his injuries. He mutters the names of both Yuma and Astral and leaves on his motorcycle (this scene was cut from the dub).
         The  four cloaked  figures.     
 Tori can't believe Yuma is asleep. Caswell says that's typical of Yuma and Cathy says they should let him sleep on her lap instead of Tori's. Tori turns to Astral, asking him to do something, but Astral says not even he can wake Yuma up once he's asleep. Yuma continues to snore, muttering "kattobingu" between snores. Tori says if it can't be helped, they'll just let him be. Astral declares his twentieth observation: "It appears one can feel good about a loss as well" (in the dub, "Even in a Duel lost, can a friendship be found"). In the  Barian World ,  four cloaked figures  gather in room full of  Baria Crystals .  One of the figures  says they didn't expect this of Yuma Tsukumo and Astral. His eyes glowing pink, he turns to the other three figures and says that they may have to intervene directly now.
 
 Featured Duel: Yuma Tsukumo vs. Kite Tenjo 
 Duel continues from  the previous episode . 
 
         " Starliege Paladynamo " is Summoned.     
 Turn 4: Kite 
Kite has just conducted his Draw Phase. As his opponent  controls  a  Special Summoned   monster  and he controls no monsters,  Kite   activates  " Card of Adversity " to  draw  two cards. As he controls no monsters, Kite activates " Accellight " to Special Summon " Daybreaker " ( 4/1700/0) in Attack Position (as it's a  Level  4 or lower  LIGHT   Warrior - Type  monster), though he may not  Normal Summon  or  Set  this  turn . As "Daybreaker" was Special Summoned, Kite activates its effect to Special Summon another copy of "Daybreaker" ( 4/1700/0) in Attack Position. Kite  overlays  his two "Daybreakers" in order to  Xyz Summon  " Starliege Paladynamo " ( 4/2000/1000, ORU: 2) in Attack Position. 
 Kite activates the effect of "Starliege Paladynamo" to  detach  an  Overlay Unit  ("Starliege Paladynamo": 2 → 1 ORU), decrease the  ATK  of " Number 39: Utopia " to 0 ("Utopia": 2500 → 0 ATK), and  negate  the effects of all other cards on the  field . "Starliege Paladynamo"  attacks  and  destroys  "Utopia" (Yuma: 2500 → 500 LP). At the end of the Battle Phase, the effect of "Starliege Paladynamo" expires.
 Turn 5: Yuma 
 Yuma  draws " Card of Spell Containment " and subsequently activates it to draw two cards at the expense of being unable to activate other  Spell Cards  or set cards for the remainder of the turn (Yuma draws "Gagaga Clerk" and " Gagaga Caesar "). Yuma Normal Summons "Gagaga Caesar" ( 3/1800/600) in Attack Position. He then Special Summons " Gagaga Clerk " ( 2/400/800) in Attack Position via its own effect as he controls another " Gagaga " monster. 
 Yuma activates the effect of "Gagaga Caesar" to  banish  " Ganbara Knight " from his Graveyard and change the Level of all  face-up  "Gagaga" monsters he controls to that of the banished monster ("Gagaga Caesar":   3 → 4; "Gagaga Clerk":   2 → 4). Yuma overlays "Gagaga Caesar" and "Gagaga Clerk" in order to Xyz Summon " Heroic Champion - Excalibur " ( 4/2000/2000, ORU: 2) in Attack Position. 
 "Heroic Champion - Excalibur" attacks "Starliege Paladynamo" and Yuma activates the effect of "Heroic Champion - Excalibur" (as he has at most 500 Life Points) to detach all Overlay Units of "Heroic Champion - Excalibur" ("Heroic Champion - Excalibur": 2 → 0 ORU) and double its ATK ("Heroic Champion - Excalibur": 2000 → 4000 ATK). "Heroic Champion - Excalibur" then destroys "Starliege Paladynamo" (Kite: 2200 → 200 LP). As "Starliege Paladynamo" was destroyed by a card used by Kite's opponent, Kite activates its final effect to draw a card. At the end of the Battle Phase, the effect of "Heroic Champion - Excalibur" expires ("Heroic Champion - Excalibur": 4000 → 2000 ATK).
 Turn 6: Kite 
Kite draws. He then activates " Galaxy Zero " to revive " Galaxy-Eyes Photon Dragon " ( 8/3000/2500) in Attack Position and equip it with "Galaxy Zero". Due to the second effect of "Galaxy Zero", its effects are negated. "Galaxy-Eyes Photon Dragon" attacks "Heroic Champion - Excalibur" and due to the third effect of "Galaxy Zero", "Galaxy-Eyes Photon Dragon" loses 800 ATK ("Galaxy-Eyes Photon Dragon": 3000 → 2200 ATK). "Galaxy-Eyes Photon Dragon" then destroys "Heroic Champion - Excalibur" (Yuma: 500 → 300 LP). At the end of the Battle Phase, the third effect of "Galaxy Zero" expires ("Galaxy-Eyes Photon Dragon": 2200 → 3000 ATK). Kite Sets a card.
 Turn 7: Yuma 
Yuma draws " Gagagadraw " and subsequently activates it to draw two cards by banishing "Gagaga Caesar", "Gagaga Clerk" and " Gagaga Magician " from his Graveyard. He then activates " Xyz Revival " to revive "Utopia" ( 4/2500/2000) in Attack Position. Yuma then overlays "Utopia" with itself via  Chaos Xyz Evolution  in order to Xyz Summon " Chaos Number 39: Utopia Ray " ( 4/2500/2000, ORU: 1) in Attack Position. Yuma activates the effect of "Utopia Ray" to detach "Utopia" ("Utopia Ray": 1 → 0 ORU), increase the ATK of "Utopia Ray" by 500 ('Utopia Ray": 2500 → 3000 ATK) and decreases the ATK of "Galaxy-Eyes Photon Dragon" by 1000 ("Galaxy-Eyes Photon Dragon": 3000 → 2000 ATK). 
 "Utopia Ray" attacks "Galaxy-Eyes Photon Dragon", but Kite activates the fourth effect of "Galaxy Zero" to  send  it to the Graveyard and prevent the destruction of "Galaxy-Eyes Photon Dragon"  by battle . As "Galaxy Zero" was removed from the field, its final effect reduces the ATK of "Galaxy-Eyes Photon Dragon" to 0 ("Galaxy-Eyes Photon Dragon": 2000 → 0 ATK). Due to the effect of Yuma's " Zerozerock ", the attack is nullified. Yuma activates his face-down " Dimension Gate " to banish "Utopia Ray". Yuma Sets a card.
 Turn 8: Kite 
Kite draws " Galaxy Wizard " and subsequently Normal Summons it ( 4/0/1800) in Attack Position. Kite then overlays "Galaxy-Eyes Photon Dragon" and "Galaxy Wizard" (whose first effect increases its Level by 4 and treats it as two monsters) in order to Xyz Summon " Neo Galaxy-Eyes Photon Dragon " in Attack Position with 2000 less ATK since Kite used "Galaxy Wizard" for an Xyz Summon while using its first effect ( 8/4500 → 2500/3000, ORU: 2). 
 "Neo Galaxy-Eyes Photon Dragon" attacks  directly , but Yuma activates the second effect of "Dimension Gate" to send it to the Graveyard and Special Summon "Utopia Ray" ( 4/2500/2000) in Attack Position with its effects negated. A  replay  occurs and Kite uses "Neo Galaxy-Eyes Photon Dragon" to attack "Utopia Ray", destroying both monsters in a Double KO. 
 As he controls no monsters and his Xyz Monster was just destroyed, Yuma activates his face-down " Xyz Double Back " to revive "Utopia Ray" ( 4/2500/2000) and "Utopia" ( 4/2500/2000), both in Attack Position. Kite activates his own "Xyz Double Back" to revive "Neo Galaxy-Eyes Photon Dragon" ( 8/4500/3000) and "Galaxy-Eyes Photon Dragon" ( 8/3000/2500), both in Attack Position. "Galaxy-Eyes Photon Dragon" and "Neo Galaxy-Eyes Photon Dragon" attack and destroy "Utopia" and "Utopia Ray", respectively (Yuma: 300 → 0 LP).
