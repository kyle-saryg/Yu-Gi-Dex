 Lyrics (TV Size) 
 Rōmaji English 
 Nani wo tsukameru no ka? Nani ga dekiru no ka? 
Fumidasu bokura de mitsukeru kitto 
Tomerarenai kimochi atsui mune no kodou 
 Shinjitsu no koe ga kikoetanda 
Kizutsuiteshitta yo 
Tsuyoku nareru basho wo 
Tenohira no yume kasane 
 Itsuka kimi ni tsunageyou 
Sutaato no aizu sakebe kokoro motomeru mama 
Kyuukutsu de hanpa na nichijou wa tobikoeteyaru 
Dasshu shite kagayaku mi ai zenbu te ni ireru sa 
 
Shinjiteru kizuna wo idaite kakateyuku ashita he  
 What are you grasping for? 
What good will it do you? 
We're moving forward and we'll make sure to discover what 
 Never-ending sentiments 
the passionate beats of our hearts 
and the voice of truth are all what we heard 
 We got busted up and we learned 
of where we can get stronger 
I'll search through the dreams in my hand 
and one day I'll lead them all to you 
 Shouting the signal for the START 
we'll do what our hearts want 
and vault over our cramped 
and mediocre lives 
 We'll make a DASH 
and attain every bit of our brilliant futures 
Embracing the bonds we so believe in 
 
we'll race toward tomorrow
