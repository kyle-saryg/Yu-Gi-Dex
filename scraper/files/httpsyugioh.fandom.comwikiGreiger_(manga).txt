 Biography 
 History 
       Greiger loses to Jack.      Greiger became the Mid-American Champion and developed a reputation as the "Undefeated Giant". However he was beaten by  Jack Atlas  in a Duel, after which Jack ridiculed him and was unimpressed with the fight Greiger had put up. [1]  Since then, Greiger has been set on getting revenge on Jack. [2] 
 Yu-Gi-Oh! 5D's 
 A silhouette of him was seen when  Lazar  explained the type of people who will be competing in the  D1 Grand Prix  to  Yusei . [3] 
 Greiger participates in the D1 Grand Prix. He was surprised when Jack patronizes the contestants, saying the Grand Prix seems to just be a consolation tournament. [2] 
 He faces  Yusei Fudo  in the first round and vowed to crush Yusei in order to get his rematch against Jack. [2]  Greiger aimed for a  One Turn Kill , which Yusei foiled. After Yusei started to put up a good fight, Greiger decided to bring out his " Sense  Pressure", which he had been saving for Jack. [1] 
 Even though Greiger Summoned his ace: " Blaze Fenix, the Burning Bombardment Bird " and put up a good fight, he was ultimately defeated by Yusei's tactics. After the Duel, Greiger looks upon his destroyed  Duel Runner  and his loss as his own fault for basing his Dueling and Sense off of his revenge and anger at Jack, he then wishes Yusei best of luck in the rest of the tournament. [4] 
 
 Deck 
 Greiger uses a  Fusion   Burn  Deck . He runs many cards which allow him to quickly  Fusion Summon , such as " Extra Fusion " and " Fusion Charge ", and his  Fusion Monsters  inflict heavy  effect damage .
