 Devack wears the black robes of the  Dark Signers  that were accented with yellow stripes. His  dark mark  is the monkey. 
 
 Personality 
 Devack had great loyalty to the  Dark Signers ' cause and to  Roman  in particular. His final words were an apology to Roman for losing. He also looked down on those who were not  Signers , and enjoyed the pain of others, as seen when he tried to show  Luna  more sadness by using " Ancient Fairy Dragon " against her. [1] [2] 
 
 Biography 
 It is unknown how Devack became a  Dark Signer . At some point upon his rebirth, he met  Roman  and the other Dark Signers, and pledged his loyalty to Roman. At some point, he was given  Ancient Fairy Dragon  by Roman to set up his eventual confrontation with  Luna .  He appeared out of the original  Ener-D  Reactor by arriving by helicopter in order to free  Greiger  from custody with an " Axe of Despair " card, as his transport guard's souls had been absorbed by the " Earthbound Immortal Ccaryahua ". Devack then invited him to join them and get revenge on  Rex Goodwin  for the destruction of his hometown. They later picked up  Misty Tredwell  and  Carly Carmine  from the destroyed  Arcadia Movement building  and returned to the Ener-D reactor.
 He finally showed himself to his rivals, the Signers, after Roman's  Shadow Duel  against  Yusei  concluded. Before their departure, he showed Luna that he possessed the "Ancient Fairy Dragon" card, and so in order to get it back, she must fight him. Later on, as each one of the Signers was set on defeating their respective opponent, they split up to each of the four control units of the Original Ener-D reactor. As Luna and Leo were taken by  Trudge  to where Devack was, she instead went into the  Duel Monsters Spirit World   in order to free  Ancient Fairy Dragon  from her imprisonment with the the help of her servant,  Regulus . However, when  Leo  found the control unit, Devack approached him while the Monkey geoglyph materialized. Leo then bravely challenged him, and stating that if he defeated the Dark Signer then Luna wouldn't have to Duel him.
 Despite Devack's warning that  Leo  wouldn't be able to save himself and his sister, as he was not a Signer, the Duel was still on. Devack was quickly able to inflict damage to his opponent at the start, but Leo counterattacked with " Power Tool Dragon ", his ace card. Devack then Summoned the  Dark Synchro Monster , " Zeman the Ape King ". Eventually, Leo was able to destroy his Dark Synchro Monster, at the exact same time that Regulus destroyed  Zeman  in the Spirit World, by utilizing his "Power Tool Dragon". However Devack Summoned his true ace card, " Earthbound Immortal Cusillu ". He attacked  directly , but Leo prevented himself from being defeated. Then, Luna arrived, and took Leo's  Duel Disk  and the twins Dueled together.
 
       Devack turning into dust.     
 However, Devack Summoned "Ancient Fairy Dragon", and later sacrificed her to prevent the destruction of "Cusillu". This ultimately backfired for him, as Luna used Leo's " Respect Synchron " to Summon "Ancient Fairy" to her side and used its  effect  to  destroy  " Closed Forest " thus  negating  all the effects of "Cusillu" and rendering it useless. Then Luna assaulted it with "Power Tool Dragon", weakening it and then destroyed it with "Ancient Fairy Dragon". The Duel ended with Devack's defeat.
 Regretting his defeat, Devack turned into dust while asking Roman for forgiveness for failing the Dark Signers (In the dub, he tried to drag Leo and Luna with him to the Netherworld, but failed when Yusei came in and saved them).
 
       Devack upon returning alive     
 When Rex was defeated in the final battle and the  King of the Netherworld  was destroyed, Devack was restored to life, along with the other Dark Signers, except for Roman and Rex himself. It is unknown if he kept the memories of his time as a Dark Signer.
 
 Trivia 
 Devack was the only  Dark Signer  whose death and transformation into a Dark Signer was never explored. 
 According to the  Yu-Gi-Oh! 10th Anniversary Animation Book , Devack was originally intended to be from a cult of demon worshippers. He was sacrificed to the cult's Gods and reborn as a Dark Signer.
