 Timaeus, like the other  Legendary Knights , is named after one of Plato's  dialogues , which are the source of many of the rumors pertaining to Atlantis.
 In his human form, Timaeus dons teal/green armor, and his distinguishing feature is a scar over his right eye having lost it in an encounter with  Dartz . Like the other knights, he bears a similar facial expression to his chosen Duelist,  Yami Yugi . Timaeus's humanoid color scheme continues into his dragon form, where he is also mostly teal.
 Timaeus has a  Duel Monsters  card form. The card, " The Eye of Timaeus ", along with its counterparts " Fang of Critias " and " Claw of Hermos " are unlike other cards. They have their own set of rules and are color coded blue. The Dragons were placed in the  Monster Card Zone , but played similar to if they were  Spell Cards  and could combine with other cards. Timaeus can combine with  monsters  to form new monsters. It has been shown to combine with two such monsters, " Dark Magician Girl " and " Dark Magician ", forming " Dark Magician Girl the Dragon Knight " and " Amulet Dragon " respectively (Yami attempted to combine Timaeus with " Poison Butterfly ", but it didn't work as Timaeus' concerns about Yami losing his self-esteem at this point).
 
 Biography 
 Ancient Atlantis 
 Timeaus and the other legendary knights,  Critias  and  Hermos  resided in the Spirit World, until  Atlantis  is corrupted by the  Orichalcos .  Ironheart  Summoned them to the human world to help him thwart Dartz's efforts to wipe out the population of Atlantis in the misled hopes of starting the kingdom anew. However Dartz was able to weaken the knights by trapping them in the forms of dragons.
 The  Legendary Dragons , fought alongside rebels from Atlantis and other Duel Spirits against Dartz,  Orichalcos Soldiers  and  The Great Leviathan . Timaeus successfully defeated a number of Orichalcos Soldiers. Dartz however teased his power, striking him with lightning and taking out his eye by means of the  Sword of Kings .
 The battle concluded with neither side victorious, and Atlantis sinking to the bottom of the sea. The Dragons were sealed in crystal prisons, to be freed if need should ever arise.
 
 Present time 
         Timaeus in his dragon form.     
 Yugi Muto  and his other-self  Yami Yugi  were chosen as a Legendary Duelist to wield Timaeus. In a dream, the Yugis are taken to the Duel Monsters Spirit World, where they are taken to Timaeus, trapped in his prison. By removing a sword they set Timaeus free and get the card " The Eye of Timaeus ", so that they may Summon "Timaeus" while playing  Duel Monsters .
 As a card, Timaeus had the ability to combine itself with Yugi's other monsters. He aided Yugi in his Duel against  Rafael , but it was concerned when Yami Yugi played " The Seal of Orichalcos ". After Yugi lost his soul, Yami Yugi tried to summon "Timaeus" against  Weevil Underwood , but Yami was deemed unworthy after his transgressions in his previous Duel. Yami Yugi came into contact with the spirits of Ironheart and  Chris . They, including Timaeus, helped Yami regain his self-esteem, allowing him to summon Timaeus once more. Yami did it while fighting Dartz's minions.
 When Yugi faced Dartz, he used " Legend of Heart " to change the dragons back to their true forms. Together with  Critias  and  Hermos , Yugi was able to defeat Dartz's " Divine Serpent Geh " and win the Duel.
 However, The Great Leviathan, was Summoned again. Timeaus took part in the battle against it, this time his side emerged victorious. He, Critias, Hermos, and  Dark Magician Girl  appeared on the beach to thank Yugi before returning to the spirit world.
