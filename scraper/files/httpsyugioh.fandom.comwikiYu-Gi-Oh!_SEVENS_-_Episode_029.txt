 " Heavy Duty Duel " known in Japan as " Galient Digging " is the twenty-ninth episode of the  Yu-Gi-Oh! SEVENS  anime. It first aired in Japan on December 19, 2020.
 Rayne  and  Rino  cross the mountains to join the Training Camp, but they stop when they heard a strange engine noise. The source is a boy riding on a blue cavarly,  Galient Tazaki  from Goha 6th Elementary! Hearing him hint that he might be sabotaging the training camp, Ranze challenges Galient to a Duel!
 
 Featured Duel: Rayne Nanahoshi vs Galient Tazaki 
 Turn 1: Rayne Rayne's hand contains two copies of " Flowerfang Wolf Kurobana ", " Flowerfang Warrior Rindo ", " Flowerfang Shadow Strike ", and " Flowerfang Spores ". Rayne Sets 3 Monsters and 2 Cards.
 Turn 2: Galient Galient's hand contains two copies of " Shovel Crusher ", two copies of " Bull Breaker ", and " Drilling Mandrill ". Galient Normal Summons two copies of "Shovel Crusher" (900/1200). He then Tributes both "Shovel Crusher" to Tribute Summon "Drilling Mandrill" (1700/2000). Galient Normal Summons 2 copies of "Bull Breaker" (1200/800). Since "Drilling Mandrill" was Normal Summoned this turn, Galient activates the effect of "Drilling Mandrill", allowing him to choose face-down Defense Position monsters Ranze controls up to the number of  Machine  monsters he controls, then switch them to Attack Position and change their original ATK to 0 until the end of this turn. Since he controls 3 Machine monsters, he changes Rayne's two Set "Flowerfang Wolf Kurobana" (800/1300 → 0/1300) and "Flowerfang Warrior Rindo" (1300/1400 → 0/1400) to Attack Position. The two "Bull Breaker" attack and destroy the two "Wolf Kurobana" (Rayne: 4000 → 2800 → 1600). "Drilling Mandrill" attacks "Warrior Rindo", but since a Plant monster Rayne controls was targeted for an attack, she activates her Set "Flowerfang Shadow Strike", allowing her to place 2  Plant  monsters from her GY on the bottom of her Deck to change all Attack Position monsters Galient controls to face-up Defense Position. She places her two "Wolf Kurobana" on the bottom of the Deck and changes "Drilling Mandrill" and the two "Bull Breaker" to Defense Position.
 Turn 3: Rayne Since Rayne has no cards in her hand, she draws five cards. Rayne Normal Summons " Flowerfang Oni Yuri " (500/500). She then Tributes "Oni Yuri" and "Warrior Rindo" to Tribute Summon " Flowerfang Kunoichi Etranzer " (2300/1000). Rayne activates her Set "Flowerfang Spores", allowing her to send the top card of her Deck to the GY to Special Summon a Level 4 or lower Plant monster from her GY, but that monster will be placed on the bottom of her Deck during the End Phase. She sends "Kunoichi Etranzer" to the GY and Special Summons "Warrior Rindo" (1300/1400). Rayne activates the effect of "Kunoichi Etranzer", allowing her to send a Plant monster from her hand to the GY to Special Summon another "Kunoichi Etranzer" from her GY, but that monster will be placed on the bottom of her Deck during the End Phase, also the "Kunoichi Etranzer" that activated its effect cannot attack directly this turn. Rayne sends "Wolf Kurobana" to the GY and Special Summons "Kunoichi Etranzer" (2300/1000). Rayne activates " Greater Piercing!! ", allowing her to send a card from her hand to the GY to choose 2 monsters she controls with the same Level to grant them the ability to inflict piercing battle damage this turn. She sends "Spores" to the GY and chooses her two "Kunoichi Etranzer". "Warrior Rindo" attacks and destroys a "Bull Breaker". One "Kunoichi Etranzer" attacks and destroys the other "Bull Breaker" (Galient: 4000 → 2500 LP). The other "Etoranze" attacks and destroys "Drilling Mandrill" (Galient: 2500 → 2200 LP). During the End Phase, "Warrior Rindo" and the Special Summoned "Kunoichi Etranzer" are returned to the bottom of Rayne's Deck.
 Turn 4: Galient Since Galient has no cards in his hand, he draws five cards. Galient Normal Summons "Bull Breaker" (1200/800). He then activates " Mequestrian Tactics ", allowing him to send an  EARTH  Machine monster he controls to the GY to Special Summon an EARTH Machine monster from his GY, but other monsters he controls cannot declare an attack this turn. He sends "Bull Breaker" to the GY and Special Summons "Drilling Mandrill" (1700/2000). Galient activates " Darkness Approaches ", allowing him to send 2 cards from his hand to the GY to change a face-up monster on the field to face-down Defense Position. He sends " Reward of Tyranny " and "Shovel Crusher" to the GY and changes "Kunoichi Etranzer" to face-down Defense Position. Galient activates the effect of "Drilling Mandrill", changing Rayne's Set "Kunoichi Etranzer" (2300/1000 → 0/1000) to Attack Position. "Drilling Mandrill" attacks and destroys "Kunoichi Etranzer" (Rayne: 1600 → 0 LP).
