 The Outcome of the Tag Duel!! 
 
 "Birth of the Ultimate Tag!!"  is the forty-seventh chapter of the  Yu-Gi-Oh! GX  manga . It was first printed in Japanese in the  V Jump  magazine and in English in the  Shonen Jump  magazine. Both of which were printed in  volume 7  of the  Yu-Gi-Oh! GX  graphic novels afterwards.
 Alexis  and  Bastion  continue their Tag Duel against  Adrian  and  Jesse .
 
 Summary 
 Alexis has just drawn her " Blizzard Princess ", and fortifies her defenses with " Ice Doll " and " Curtain of Hail " (a short explanation of Tag Duel rules is shown here). Adrian deduces her strategy and counters with his " Forbidden Beast Dharmjul ", using " Forbidden Mantra " to allow it to destroy one of Alexis's Spell or Trap cards. Alexis blocks his move, hoping for Bastion to cover for her until her next turn, but Bastion, eager to redeem himself, instead summons his own high-Level monster with Alexis's monsters, " Daidara-Bocchi ", and uses his " Phantasmagoria " Spell to make all other monsters  Yokai  and increase its ATK to 3500. Unfortunately for Bastion, Adrian counters his attack again with his " Mantra's Curse-Binding " Trap.
 Alexis angrily taps her foot (intimidating Jaden, Syrus and Bastion), and tells him to stop getting worked up over fighting the American Duelists (oblivious to the fact that, as  Jaden  and  Syrus  point out,  she  is the reason that he's getting worked up), pointing out that if he was as calm as he normally is, she'd be able to count on him. Bastion agrees, and thinks that this is where he shows them what he's really got before Setting two cards.
 Jesse begins his turn, inflicting the first damage to Bastion and Alexis with " Rose Papillon ", and using "Boa Bolan" to destroy "Daidara-Bocchi", much to Adrian's shock, as it also destroys Boa Bolan and causing them to take damage. Alexis is forced on the defensive, though she takes note of Bastion's Set cards and the " Mezuki " in his Graveyard - Jesse's move had in fact prevented her from summoning "Blizzard Princess" this turn. On Adrian's turn, he sacrifices Jesse's two "Papillon's" to Summon his " Forbidden Beast Bronn ", and attempts to destroy their Set cards, but Alexis uses Bastion's " Leaf of the Transforming Tanuki " to redirect it to " Forbidden Mantra ". Adrian isn't fazed, and simply activates another copy, giving "Bronn" immunity to card effects. When he ends his turn, noticing Jesse looking at him, he angrily asks if Jesse has anything to say to him, but Jesse tells him that he doesn't.
 Bastion draws " Ghostly Reinforcements ", and Sets it, thinking that they're all Set. On Jesse's turn, his plans are thrown off by not being able to Summon his " Butterfly Fairy ", so he Sets his " Insect Horde ", seemingly hoping to Summon his "Papillons" for use as sacrifices, along with his " Mirror Force ". On Alexis's turn, she uses "Fate of the Living" cause all the monsters in the Graveyard to become Yokai (which cripples Jesse's plans again), and allows her to remove "Mezuki" to resummon "Ice Doll". Alexis then uses "Ghostly Reinforcements" Summon two Yokai and sacrifices them to Summon "Blizzard Princess" at last, negating the activation and effect of all her opponents Spell and Trap cards. She uses her " Ice Doll Mirror " to have her "Ice Doll" take on the attack strength and form of "Blizzard Princess," and the two monsters attack, destroying Adrian's "Forbidden Beasts".
 
 Featured Duel: Alexis Rhodes & Bastion Misawa vs. Adrian Gecko & Jesse Anderson 
 Duel continues from  the previous chapter .
 Turn 5: Alexis 
 Alexis  draws "Blizzard Princess". She then  Normal Summons  " Ice Doll " (800/1000) in  Defense Position . She then  activates  " Curtain of Hail ". As long as it is  face-up , all  Level  3 and lower  WATER 
 monsters  are immune to destruction by both  battle  and  card effects . She then  Sets  a card.
 Turn 6: Adrian 
 Adrian  draws. He then Normal Summons " Forbidden Beast Dharmjul " (1200/1400) in  Attack Position . He then activates " Forbidden Mantra ", which will unlock the effects of his " Forbidden Beasts " as long it remains on the  field . He activates the effect of "Dharmjul" in an attempt to  destroy  "Curtain of Hail", but Alexis activates her  face-down  " The Ice-Bound God ",  negating  the effect of "Dharmjul" as she  controls  two face-up WATER monsters. Adrian Sets a card.
 Turn 7: Bastion 
 Bastion   draws  " Daidara-Bocchi ". He  Tributes  Alexis' "Ice Doll" and " Crystal Girl " to Summon " Daidara-Bocchi " (2900/2500) in Attack Position. He then activates " Phantasmagoria ", which will treat all face-up monsters as  Yokai Monsters . Therefore, "Daidara-Bocchi" gains 600  ATK  via its own effect ("Daidara-Bocchi": 2900 → 3500/2500). "Daidara-Bocchi"  attacks  "Dharmjul", but Adrian activates his face-down " Mantra's Curse-Binding ",  paying  800  Life Points  (Adrian/Jesse 4000 → 3200) to prevent the attack. During each of Bastion and Alexis'  End Phases , "Daidara-Bocchi" will lose 500 ATK. Bastion Sets two cards ("Daidara-Bocchi": 3500 → 3000/2500).
 Turn 8: Jesse 
 Jesse  draws "Rose Papillon". He then activates the effect of Adrian's "Dharmjul" to destroy "Phantasmagoria" ("Daidara-Bocchi": 3000 → 2400/2500). He Normal Summons " Rose Papillon " (1400/800) in Attack Position. "Rose Papillon" attacks  directly  via its own effect (Alexis/Bastion 4000 → 2600), as there is  another  face-up  Insect - Type  monster on the field. Jesse attacks "Daidara-Bocchi" with " Forbidden Beast Boa Bolan " (Adrian/Jesse 3200 → 2500). "Daidara-Bocchi" is destroyed at the end of the  Damage Step  via the effect of "Boa Bolan". Jesse Sets a card.
 Turn 9: Alexis 
Alexis draws "Ice Barrier". She then Normal Summons " Snowman " (900/1500) in  Defense Position  and Sets a card.
 Turn 10: Adrian 
Adrian draws "Forbidden Beast Bronn". He then Tributes Jesse's " White Papillon " and "Rose Papillon" to Summon " Forbidden Beast Bronn " (2700/2100) in Attack Position. He activates the effect of "Dharmjul" to destroy Bastion and Alexis' face down cards, but Alexis activates Bastion's face-down " Leaf of the Transforming Tanuki ", negating the effect and destroying "Forbidden Mantra" instead. Due to "Forbidden Mantra" leaving the field, all "Forbidden Beasts" lose their effects. Adrian activates a second "Forbidden Mantra" from his hand. "Bronn" attacks and destroys "Snowman". "Dharmjul" attacks directly, but Alexis activates her face-down " Ice Barrier ", reducing the ATK of "Dharmjul" to 0 and preventing it from attacking again and changing  Battle positions .
 Turn 11: Bastion 
Bastion draws. " Ghostly Reinforcements ". He then Normal Summons " Nurikabe " (900/2000) in Defense Position and Sets a card.
 Turn 12: Jesse 
Jesse draws " Insect Horde ", while his hand is shown to contain " Butterfly Fairy " and three unspecified cards. He attacks and destroys "Nurikabe" with "Bronn". He Sets " Mirror Force ".
 Turn 13: Alexis 
Alexis draws " Ice Doll Mirror ". She then activates Bastion's face-down " Fate of the Living ", which will treat all monsters in the  Graveyard  as Yokai Monsters. She activates the effect of the " Mezuki " in Bastion's Graveyard,  removing  it from play to  Special Summon  "Ice Doll" (800/1000) in Attack Position. She then activates Bastion's face-down " Ghostly Reinforcements ", paying 1000 Life Points (Alexis/Bastion 2600 → 1600) to Special Summon "Nurikabe" (900/2000) and " Long-Tailed Black Horse " (1400/800) from Bastion's Graveyard. She Tributes "Nurikabe" and "Black Horse" to Tribute Summon " Blizzard Princess " (2800/2100) in Attack Position. The effect of "Blizzard Princess" prevents the opponents from activating Spells and Trap cards this turn. She activates "Ice Doll Mirror" from her hand, which allows her "Ice Doll" to become "Blizzard Princess". She attacks "Dharmjul" and "Bronn" with the genuine "Blizzard Princess" and its double (Adrian/Jesse 2600 → 0).
