 This card's monster effect is meant to trigger the effects of various " Abyss Script "  Spell Cards  that are triggered when destroyed by an opponent's card effect - which this card is treated as because control of it was switched to your opponent. However, those effects will only trigger when you have an " Abyss Actor "  Pendulum Monster  face-up in your Extra Deck.
 The easiest means of achieving this setup is the use of "Abyss Actor - Extras'"  Pendulum Effect , followed by its monster effect, on the same turn.
