 Overview 
 To serve their interdimensional invasions,  Duel Academy  possesses these kind of devices. One of these machines is a vertical tube that, when activated, produces a purple plasma-like energy that quickly fills the tube and lets the traveler go through. They also developed minimized devices which look like a wristwatch. [1]  This kind of technology can be installed into  Duel Disks . [2] 
 The Resistance  also has access to this technology, which allows them to travel to the  Standard Dimension . [3]  By reverse engineering the technology in the  Xyz Dimension 's Duel Disk,  LID  was able to modify the  Lancers ' Duel Disks with the same technology, to be activated by activating  special Spell Cards , which contain the destination's coordinates.
 Jean-Michel Roger  also created his own "Interdimensional Travel Device" which he planned to utilize if he ever had to return to the Fusion Dimension, or if Duel Academy invaded the Synchro Dimension, he would teleport the entirety of  New Domino City  itself across the dimensions. In the end, he ended up using it in order to destroy New Domino, but it malfunctioned, which resulted a wormhole to opened up and sent Roger to be swept away and another wormhole sent Zuzu to an  unknown dimension . And one more wormhole sent Yuya, Gong, Sylvio, and Shay to the Xyz Dimension. [4] 
 Three years ago,  Declan 's research team created an "Interdimensional Travel Device", which  Yusho  used in order go to the  Fusion Dimension  and talk to  Leo Akaba . However, it sent him to the Xyz Dimension. [5] 
 
 Other methods 
 Yugo  claimed that he has been teleported by his " Clear Wing Synchro Dragon " card. 
 Zuzu's bracelet  was able to teleport Zuzu, Yugo and his  Duel Runner  from the Standard Dimension to the  Synchro Dimension .

 Wormholes can also teleport people to other Dimensions, but they have no set destination and its impossible to predict where they would lead to.

 After the events that led to the recreation of the ARC-V Dimension following  Riley  and  Ray 's victory and endeavor to seal  Z-ARC 's soul. The presence of power from ARC-V, an "Interdimensional Corridor" was generated allowing for the  Four Dimensions  to be connected with one another. [6]
