 Deck 
 It's unknown what Otes' real Deck is but it was shown to have the " Sevens Road Magician " card made by himself. The card was later given to Yuga.
 Otes in his Duel with Yuga uses a  " Blue-Eyes " Deck  capable of summoning the famed " Blue-Eyes White Dragon " at a fast rate with the aid of the  Rush Duel  Rules, and supporting it with his Spells or Trap Cards to quickly destroy his opponent's monsters, and use "Blue-Eyes" for a quick beatdown strategy.
 In his three-way Duel with  Luke ,  Gavin , and  Romin  he uses a " Red-Eyes " Deck which just like his previous Deck utilizes " Red-Eyes Black Dragon " with support cards to summon it at a fast rate along with using cards such as " Inferno Fire Blast " to damage his opponent critically.
 During his Duel against  Yuga Goha , he uses a " Dark Magician " Deck which utilizes " Dark Magician " and " Dark Magician Girl " with support cards to summon them quickly along with  Spell Cards  that destroy his opponent's cards and increases the ATK of his monsters. The  Trap Cards  tend to focus on protecting his "Dark Magician" from being destroyed by battle by switching the target to a different monster or returning "Dark Magician" from the GY to his hand (to prevent Yuga Goha from using " Monster Reborn " on it).

 Trivia 
 Otes' Deck is a reference to  Seto Kaiba 's own Deck filled with monsters which are mostly Dragons, along with Spells and Traps that support "Blue-Eyes White Dragon".
 His name can also be written as "Otes", which is "Seto" backwards.  Episode 24  spells his name this way in an on-screen graphic. 
 His Deck also references  Atticus Rhodes ' Deck filled with "Red-Eyes Black Dragon" cards when he was possessed by  Nightshroud .
