      Gold Eye of Anubis Hologram.     
       Silver Eye of Anubis Hologram.     
 The  Eye of Anubis Hologram  is a security foil symbol placed at the bottom right of all official  Yu-Gi-Oh!  cards, with the exception of some very early prints in the  OCG  such as those in  Starter Box . Contrary to its appearance, it is  not  a sticker, but is printed directly onto the card. It is also officially described as "images of the “Millennium Eye” as well as the text YU-GI-OH! on it."  [1] 
 The hologram serves as  counterfeit  protection as well as being used to identify the edition of a card. All  Limited Edition  and  1st Edition  cards, in addition to being labeled as such on the card itself, will have a  gold  Eye of Anubis Hologram, while  Unlimited Edition  cards will have a silver one.
 Stars were added to the hologram with the release of  Shadows in Valhalla  in 2018. All cards printed after this date have stars in the hologram. 
 
       Silver Eye of Anubis Hologram with Stars.     
 Official Proxy  images of cards lack this hologram, either missing it entirely or replacing it with a solid square.
