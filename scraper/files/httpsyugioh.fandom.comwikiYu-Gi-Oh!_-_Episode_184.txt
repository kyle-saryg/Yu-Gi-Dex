 Featured Battle: Yugi + Yami Yugi vs. Dartz & " The Great Leviathan " - Part 2 
 Battle continues from previous episode. 
 
 Yugi  attempts to help  Yami Yugi , but the latter tells him to stay back and that " this is [his] battle ", in which he's staking his 'justice' and his 'beliefs'. Yugi gasps: Yami Yugi said the same thing in  episode 158  when he used the "Seal of Orichalcos". 
 Yami Yugi tells him that this time it's different. He warns Yugi that, one day, they'll have to split and Yugi will have to handle on his own. And it's happening right now. Yami Yugi keeps on saying that they must accomplish his tasks. They're interconnected by everyone's thoughts. 
 Yami Yugi recalls the Duel he had with Yugi's spirit in the Stone Wastelands and Yugi's parting words. 
 By now, the "Great Leviathan" has become a blackish shape with yellow eyes, maybe meaning that it has lost part of its power and it's degrading into a more simpler form. It looms over Yami, apparently surprised at Yami's resistance. Yami claims that there's something inside of which cannot be erased no matter what. 
 Yami Yugi then recalls  the battle with the Orichalcos Soldier  and how  Ironheart ,  Chris  and  Skye  sacrificed themselves to hand " The Eye of Timaeus " to Yami Yugi. It's followed by  finding the soulless Joey ,  Rafael losing his soul ,  Kaiba's defeat , and, finally,  Dartz's hypnotizing words & the support of Yami Yugi's allies . 
 Yami Yugi then announces that the container of memories which he built together with his friends won't vanish. It's the container of 'Light'. He then commands for the 'Dark' of the heart of this planet to vanish within this so-called container. The "Great Leviathan" tries to hold on, but it's eventually assimilated and destroyed. 
 And just in time, since the tsunami generated by the rise of Atlantis is just looming over New York City. It vanishes all of sudden, leaving the military men on board the aircraft carrier totally baffled: the commander wonders if a miracle has occurred. 
 The Light Returns 
 Ironheart ,  Chris , and  Skye  appear in spirit. They welcome back the spirit of  Dartz , who thanks to  Yami Yugi  is no longer under the control of the Orichalcos God. Ironheart tells Dartz that Yami Yugi has shouldered all of Dartz's sins. 
 Ironheart tells Yugi & Yami Yugi to cross the portal: the future is awaiting them. They do so, and then Chris tells Dartz that they'll rejoin Iona's (Dartz's deceased wife and Chris' mother) spirit. 
 As Atlantis continues to crumble, the rest of the people in the temple flee since another tsunami is looming over it although Yugi & Yami are nowhere to be found. 
 Epilogue 
 Everywhere else in the world, trapped souls have been returned to their rightful bodies who wake up from their slumber. First  Weevil Underwood  and  Rex Raptor , then  Alister ,  Valon , and  Mai Valentine .
 Yugi  wakes up on a deserted island, alongside  Yami Yugi 's spirit. " Dark Magician Girl " appears before them, along with the 3  Legendary Knights  Timaeus, Hermos, and Critias. She thanks  Yugi  and  Yami  for their help: both worlds have been saved. She adds the following: "The souls of those whose flesh is already destroyed shall come back with us as well. I am sure that they wish to help build an idealistic world for the Duel Monsters to inhabit.". Yami also thanks the Legendary Knights for their help in making him get rid of his own 'Dark'. 
 
 The 3  Legendary Knights  return to the Duel Monsters' World. They will always keep a watchful eye on the world when their help is needed again. " Dark Magician Girl " follows them. 
 Yugi's " The Eye of Timaeus ", Joey's " The Claw of Hermos ", and Seto's " The Fang of Critias " Cards disappear into thin air. 
 The KaibaCorp helicopter arrives to pick up  Yugi  and  Yami Yugi 's spirit. Yugi knows that "Dark Magician Girl" wanted to add that, since Yami sealed the planet's curse inside of him, if he were to be stained by the 'Dark' of the heart again, the "Great Leviathan" would be able to come back. But Yugi is sure that it cannot happen and that Yami has achieved a new 'Light' and has become a true Pharaoh. 
 This concludes the Doma (season 4) story arc. 
 
 Differences in adaptations 
 The start of the episode is shortened - the original episode starts from around the last minute of the previous episode, whilst the dub episode cuts in before the second shot of Yami Yugi screaming as he endures the Great Leviathan's attack. 
 In the dub,  Yami Yugi 's flashback was different from the Japanese version. 
 In the first flashback, the scene was extended to have Yami Yugi activate " The Seal of Orichalcos ". 
 In the second flashback, it shows part of Yami Yugi and Yugi's  Duel . 
 In the third flashback, the scene where  Ironheart ,  Chris , and  Skye  tried to give Yami Yugi " The Eye of Timaeus " card was removed. 
 The scene where Yami and his friends found  Joey 's body was removed. 
 In the fourth flashback,  Rafael 's soul being caught in The Seal of Orichalcos and  Kaiba  losing the Duel with  Dartz  was removed. 
 In the fourth flashback, Yami's eyes are glowing green. 
 In  Alister 's flashbacks, he has a flashback about his brother  Mikey  instead of his Duel with Kaiba and him giving the broken  Dyna Dude  to his little brother. 
 In  Valon 's flashbacks, the end of his Duel with  Joey  is shown instead of him using " Burning Knuckle " to collide with Joey's " Big Bang Dragon Blow ". 
 In  Mai 's flashbacks, it shows the beginning of how she entered the  Doma  organization, when she met Yugi's friends and running towards Joey before he become unconscious. 
 All English letters are removed. 
 The spikes on the armor of " Cyber Harpie " were removed. 
 Mai's cleavage was removed. 
 The hexagram on " Dark Magician Girl " is removed.
