Falsification of history  is an ability which can be accessed via the machine,  Infinity , which allows the user to change the course of history by going to the past and changing things (as seen with Primo, who came out of a portal stating that removing Clark was already done and that he should vanish now). [1] 
 The  Three Pure Nobles  are able to harness this power. [1]

 Process 
       The shockwave above  New Domino City .     
 When history is about to be falsified, a shockwave is emitted from the sky. Wherever the shockwave passes becomes affected. Changes are made instantly and people's recollection of the previous timeline is erased. [1] 
 Some people are unaffected. Although they go to the altered timeline, they still have memories of the previous one. The nobles, being the ones who cast the falsification, are unaffected, the  Crimson Dragon  protects the  Signers  and people near them by emitting a protective bubble from their  Marks of the Dragon , and the members of  Team Ragnarok  are protected by the  Aesirs , whose card forms they possess.

 The first time this ability was seen in the series, though it was unknown how at the time, was after the duel between  Lester ,  Leo  and  Luna . [2]  The changes that were made included:
 
 The disappearance of the mansion Lester took Luna to when he showed her his Duel Board, leaving only an empty patch of land. 
 Any memories people had about the time Lester spent at Duel Academy were completely erased, seen when Leo questioned  Bob . 
 After  Jack Atlas  defeated the  Fake Jack Atlas , the seacave where he was captured in disappeared.
After  Yusei ,  Sherry  and  Bruno  gained knowledge of Yliaster through  Momentum Express , the emperors decided that it was necessary to make some changes. [1]  These included:
 
 Momentum Express was never built and  Clark Smith  was never born. [1] 
 The nobles are entered in the  World Racing Grand Prix  finals as  Team New World . [1] 
 Sherry and  Elsworth 's team is erased from the the World Racing Grand Prix finals, and their place is taken by Team New World. [1] 
 The  Three Pure Nobles  were never directors of  Sector Security , with that seat having been vacant since  Rex Goodwin 's death. Similar, the vice-director,  Lazar  was labeled as missing. This enabled him to step in and become the new director upon returning. [1] 
 An issue of  Monthly Duel  featuring  Team Ragnarok  on the cover was changed to feature Team New World. [1]
