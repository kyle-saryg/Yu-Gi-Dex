 Dark Glass 
 Is there a slightest possibility Bruno being actually  Dark Glass  (having a faster D-Wheel than Yusei would meen he's good with mechanics too) trying to infiltrate and help Yusei's gang ?! Just look at his hair color.  —This unsigned comment was made by  Fuel Synchron  ( talk  •  contribs ) 10:34, 14 October 2009 (UTC) 
 
 If it does turn out that they're the same character, we'll merge the two articles. But since that hasn't been confirmed, nor has there been any direct hints of it in the anime, that's just speculation and we're better off not mentioning it. --  Deltaneos  ( talk ) 11:54, October 14, 2009 (UTC) 
 Judging from  yugioh5ds-world , it's turned out that Bruno has the same voice actor with Dark Glass: Tanaka Hiroki (田中宏樹), so there are high posibilities that they're the same person (maybe Dark Glass is Bruno come from the future). -- 14:04, October 14, 2009 (UTC) 
 I was just asking if someone shares my opinion. Anyways, it's just a mere hint, we'll probably find-out either in the next few episodes , or never.  —This unsigned comment was made by  Fuel Synchron  ( talk  •  contribs ) 15:34, 14 October 2009 (UTC) 
 This place is for discussion about the article itself. It's not meant as a place to talk about and share opinions of a character. So I only really looked at how your question was of relevance to the article. --  Deltaneos  ( talk ) 16:10, October 14, 2009 (UTC) 
 Though the mention of Dark Glass, and the "coincidence" of Bruno sharing the same seiyu with him may not have any relevance to the article for the moment, the fact that he is left-handed may just be.  Rose Duelist  21:32, October 21, 2009 (UTC)
 I agree, also,  Dark Glass  and  Dark Glass  seems to also have met with the members of  Yliaster  before which is proven from how he knows how to stop  Machine Emperor Wisel Infinity  effect and the fact that the members of  Yliaster  seemed to know who he was (or atleast trouble for them) before we knew anything about him. These 2 facts help prove why he seemed to suddenly get atleast some of his memories back when he saw  Placido . -- RyuPhalian  15:28, October 22, 2009 (UTC)
 Just for more food for thought. Bruno uses boku like the other section says but Dark Glass uses watashi 70.107.184.244  01:26, December 22, 2009 (UTC)
 It could be due to the "memory loss" Bruno is supposedly suffering from that he's using boku. It could also be a guise to hide his possible identity as Dark Glass. Either way, he doesn't seem to be pretentious.  24.238.157.190 
 There is no doubt that Bruno is Dark Glass. I was thinking over of these two charaters. I think Bruno does uses those Glass for undercover. But when watching episode 103 recently. I think that the Yliaster are taking control of Bruno. I'm getting a pretty good visual that Bruno is Dark Glass. Both are left handed, both have the same hair color, same color eyes same skin color, same voice actor, and both are good at Mechanics. I also think after when Dark Glass was done facing Yusei the first time, I think Dark Glass was finding some evidence about the Yliaster. But there could be a chance that Bruno uses Glass to become Dark Glass in Disguised. But I think that's how Bruno end up on the beach in episode 79 -- Couldnotice  5:58 April 3, 2010 (Talk)
 
 From a  V-Jump scan . Bruno is confirmed as Dark Glass. -- Blackwings0605  14:12, April 17, 2010 (UTC) 
 The two pages have been merged now. --  Deltaneos  ( talk ) 00:05, April 18, 2010 (UTC) 
 For what happened to Bruno when he's end up on beach was that he drove away and nearly smashed kitty, which he held in recent episodes. But I don't get it how he change his jacket while he's out cold? -- FredCat100  00:11, April 18, 2010 (UTC) 
 Well, one possible explanation is that since Bruno uses computer code-like things to change his clothes, it's possible the clothing changed as a malfunction/survival instinct incase Yliaster caught him. 
 Personal pronoun 
 Should it be noted somewhere that Bruno uses "boku" as his pronoun instead of "ore"? Boku is the 'humble' version of I whereas 'ore' is the brash and boastful version used by Yusei for the non-Japanese speakers -- Blackstone Dresden  05:10, October 23, 2009 (UTC)
 
 TBH, I don't think it's really noticeable; plenty of other Yu-Gi-Oh characters have used "boku" to describe themselves, including Yugi and Syrus in the Japanese version. PoirotH  07:48, October 23, 2009 (UTC) 
 And Yugi and Syrus have it noted on their page that they use boku -- Blackstone Dresden  17:07, October 24, 2009 (UTC) 
 The "boku" part on Yugi's page is to differentiate him from Yami, as for Syrus, I can't find anything of him saying "boku". PoirotH  17:18, October 24, 2009 (UTC) 
 Oh sorry, I was mistaken, but I still think it belongs there (we have notes about Yami Bakura using ore-sama and whatever Darkness's pronoun was) -- Blackstone Dresden  23:19, October 24, 2009 (UTC) 
 Yami Bakura's pronoun, like Yugi's, is to differentiate him from his other self. As for Darkness, he uses a very unique pronoun that not many characters use, if any at all. PoirotH  04:59, October 25, 2009 (UTC) 
 Gomenasai! (I'm Sorry!) 
 I hope it doesn't get revised, but I'm the one that's been doing all the story info adds. I hope no one minds, and I know it's veeeery late to ask permission to do this. May I please continue? I try to get to it every week. SonofIvalice 
 
 No one is against you doing the additions. In fact, you're doing a pretty good job, with minor grammar mistakes. PoirotH  20:24, November 6, 2009 (UTC) 
 Thank you! XD. I usually don't make that many mistakes, but I was in a rushtoday, so there you go. Thx for fixing them and I'll keep updating it!  User:SonofIvalice 
 
 After watching episode 93.... 
 Has anyone reached the same conclusion that Bruno might be a robot? PoirotH  19:27, January 20, 2010 (UTC)
 
 I think Bruno is also a robot. To be exact, I think he's actually a Riding Roid. I also believe that Dark Glass and Bruno are not the same person. If they are, then that means that I don't know. 
 Yeah I had suscpicions for a little while now and 93 screams robot but I don't think. He's an RR because he's never shown to be a major rider
 A robot? I didn't think of that, now that you mention it maybe he is a robot. I thought he had Geass.  Falzar FZ  06:41, January 26, 2010 (UTC)
 Re: I think he is a spy made by the  Infinity Trio  and going to spy on  Yusei Fudo  team.  —This unsigned comment was made by  173.79.201.150  ( talk  •  contribs ) 00:49, January 27, 2010 (UTC) 
 But if  Bruno  is  Dark Glass . Then why did the  Infinity Trio  look confused when Yusei Dueled Dark Glass.  User: Elemental Hero Kid Neos 
 
 Something with when they went to cyber world 
 If you pause when the eye and that weird part of a monster is, you can see Jose's left eye if you look at it carefully. That part is probably the Infinity monster that Jose uses. -- ClubPenguinMaster  20:23, January 21, 2010 (UTC)Yu-Gi-Oh Master
 clearly not, Jose doesn't have the same color eyes, besides, the thing lookks nothing like the kikotei cores maybe you should pay closer attention.
 Who do you think he'll be voiced by in the dub? I think either Zane Truesdale or Seto Kaiba voice actors?-- 98.111.95.197  02:07, April 8, 2010 (UTC)
 
 Possible other "proof" Bruno is Dark Glass? 
 Well you can see clearly in the article Bruno's eyes glow red (for some unknown reason) and Dark Glass wears well Dark Glasses so couldn't this be a way for Dark Glass to stop people from noticing his eyes glow? (when triggered by some event)-- Berfomet  03:28, April 11, 2010 (UTC)
 However,now V Jump has been confirmed indeed Bruno and Dark Glass are same character ^^ (I'm really happy)
 
 Some kind of confusing things ^^ 
 Well, i have to say, i'm happy that bruno is dark glass (^^), but it doesnt make much sense:
 If Bruno is Dark Glass, he is fighting AGAINST the Machine emperors / infinity monsters, and of course Yliaster.
But when Placido saw him, Placido seemed to know Bruno, but he only said "This is no place for you to be" (or sth like this ^^) and knocked him out. If he really was an enemy of Yliaster and Placido knew him, Placido would've killed him or even took him away to the headquarters of Yliaster...
 I know, if V-Jump says Bruno is Dark Glass, i think he is, but this is still not making sense ^^.
I also believe, that Bruno is a Cyborg from some anti-Yliaster (^^) club (sorry im german XD i cant speak english well), because of his big forces...
But this is only Speculation ^^.
 Coasterfan
 Maybe Placido knew that Bruno was DG, and thought that  it wouldn't take much to kill him.  I'm probably wrong, though.
 
 Infobox image 
 What was wrong with including both the  Bruno  and  Dark Glass images  in the infobox? The Bruno one is equally if not more significant than the Dark Glass one. --  Deltaneos  ( talk ) 12:35, April 29, 2010 (UTC)
 
 I say nothing is wrong with that, people just pulling the "cool factor" bullcrap.  I think it should be changed back as the Bruno identity is his regular form and one you will see more often.  Moving it down is basically saying it's not important.  If anything it's more important, but both should be shown in the same box.   ShinobiPhoenix  12:47, April 29, 2010 (UTC) 
 In the German dub... and Tag Force 5 
 Dark Glass is called Vizor. I don't know if that will be the new 5D's English dub too, but here's proof.  http://i477.photobucket.com/albums/rr133/YukiJudai/Vizor.jpg?t=1277435843   OMG! You did it  03:32, June 25, 2010 (UTC)
 
 That's also his name in Tag Force 5 as proven by the demo version given at Comic-Con by Konami: -- Tag Force 5 Demo at Comic-Con  --  ShinobiPhoenix  ( talk  •  contribs ) 19:17, July 29, 2010 (UTC) 
 Jason Griffith??? 
 He sounds like Atticus/Nightshroud-- 98.111.95.197  ( talk ) 23:18, November 8, 2010 (UTC)
 
 Order of events 
 This may seem confusing, but do we know if the old Dark Glass we see in episode 135 is the current Bruno/Dark Glass much later in his life or if the current Bruno/Dark Glass is a part of the older one sent back in the time like Aporia? I'm wondering if we should place the section on the "apocalyptic future" at the start of the biography or the end. --  Deltaneos  ( talk ) 15:18, November 24, 2010 (UTC)
 
 My problem with most all of these entries is that they all seem to disregard  that NONE of them might be the originals .  I honestly believe the ones in the current timelines are all just androids in the resemblance of 3 of the 4 Yliaster Founders.  We know The Trio are just androids in the facade of the original Aporia and Present-time Bruno CLEARLY isn't human, so how can he age and die of old age in the future.  I mean he doesn't age and he has superhuman powers.  What's wrong with ZONE creating him as a separate plan to the Aporia Plan or the Paradox Plan.  Bruno already said  HE WAS CREATED  to stop the Trio.  So obviously he wasn't born human, not  that  Bruno.  It may seem like speculation now, but it makes the most sense.  The Founders died(as we all saw) and ZONE (Yusei if you want) made Androids in their likeness (Present-Time Bruno, the Trio who can reform into the adult Aporia, and Movie Paradox) to carry out the missions as well as honor to their memory.  Obviously, it makes more sense than trying to figure out how Bruno lives until this far into the future.  Answer:  He didn't.  The Human Bruno was already FROM the future and Droid-Bruno with info and abilities and sent back for the missions.   ShinobiPhoenix  ( talk  •  contribs ) 16:09, November 24, 2010 (UTC) 
 Evil 
 Is Evil Bruno ?
 I think that the current Bruno is an android (obviously) but when his human form died he was sent back as the android from the future and thats the Bruno we know now.  Wolfman of Light  ( talk  •  contribs ) 20:26, December 5, 2010 (UTC)
 
 That wouldn't be an android, that would be a cyborg.  This is an android.  It just has the likeness of the Human Bruno or whatever the name is.  Not the organic parts of the deceased Bruno made into a cybernetic entity.   ShinobiPhoenix  ( talk  •  contribs ) 14:16, December 6, 2010 (UTC) 
 I think that Bruno evil .  Bruno Because of memory . why  Bruno  Help yusei ?
 I don't think he himself is evil; he just follows orders from his "creator" ("ZONE") so far . He's the one that's going to introduce  "Delta Accel Synchro Summoning"  so far " Siguiendo la luna   no llegare lejos ,  tan lejos como se pueda llegar ♫  05:54, January 14, 2011 (UTC)" doesn't believe that until he/she sees it-- Wasn't  ( talk  •  contribs ) 02:29, January 16, 2011 (UTC)

 Rename 
 Hey, seeing as from the previews of the next few episodes, we know that Bruno/Vizor's actual name is Antinomy, should we change the name of the article to that? -- Blue-Eyes Starlight Dragon  ( talk  •  contribs ) 08:09, January 12, 2011 (UTC)
 
 I agree, he said in the episode that his name is Antinomy. But do we keep the names before he said his name is Antinomy Bruno? Because that would be logical...  HellKaiserN  ( talk  •  contribs ) 17:05, January 12, 2011 (UTC) 
 When someone uses multiple names their real name isn't necessarily the best name for their article. e.g. Wikipedia's article on  Jay-Z  isn't called "Shawn Corey Carter". I'm not saying we shouldn't call the article Antinomy, I'd like to see some of the upcoming episodes before I get an opinion on which is better. --  Deltaneos  ( talk ) 17:33, January 12, 2011 (UTC) 
 Why not just redirect Antimony to Bruno?  Jon Kovacs  ( talk  •  contribs ) 17:42, January 12, 2011 (UTC) 
 Regardless of the decision we come to, one should redirect to the other. I've gone ahead and redirected Antinomy to Bruno for now. We can always switch them later. That being said, I think it may be best to wait before we move the article.  Cheesedude  ( talk  •  contribs ) 19:23, January 12, 2011 (UTC) 
 Although I have to agree and that 144 and 145 finally reveal this characters' story, revising this episode again points out that this characters' memory seems to have been restored. Otherwise he wouldn't be calling himself like that in the first place and also remember that he too is a guardian of the Ark Cradle.  DracoX  ( talk  •  contribs ) 00:16, January 13, 2011 (UTC)
 
 Antinomy seems like a spoiler. Perhaps we could keep it as Bruno, but with the past events (like the apocalyptic future), we could change it appropriately for those parts (i.e. documenting his change of name from the background). Toob  ( talk  •  contribs ) 18:23, January 15, 2011 (UTC) 
 Antinomy 
 Whoever's in charge of this article can they change the name of Bruno to Antinomy? 
 superlogan7437  ( talk  •  contribs ) 20:35, January 12, 2011 (UTC)
 
 Nobody is in charge of the article. Anyone is free to edit it, but if editors disagree or are uncertain on something, they discuss it to find some agreement. There's a discussion on whether or not to rename this article Antinomy just above this one. You are free to comment there if you want. --  Deltaneos  ( talk ) 20:47, January 12, 2011 (UTC) 
 When was his memory wiped? 
 I think it had been assumed that he lost his memory after the incident with the cat. But now that episode 143 confirmed that ZONE wiped his memory and him opposing the three emperors doesn't seem like something he'd do with his memory, does that mean it was wiped before he first appeared? --  Deltaneos  ( talk ) 01:35, January 16, 2011 (UTC)
 
 Like Aporia's transfer from the ocean by his first loss against Yusei, ZONE had him there and repaired him back to normal. So that should be doing same with Bruno, as that's exact how he ended up with different cloth from before. He was in runner suit when he fell but by time he rest on the beach, he was in different cloth. Making sense? No? -- F red C at   Ta.P.  •  F.P.  •  J.R.  •  W.S.  •  Th.P.  •  S.C.  01:40, January 16, 2011 (UTC)

 Antinomy's Duel with the Unknown Duelist goes before his first duel with Yusei. Also the previews are saying that Yusei will win this time.

 He regained memory after the "light" hit him and shows his past (3 frames) in 5ds-143.  In 5ds 107 he thought "ZONE" created him to stop the trio so he really didn't gain any memory at that time too; he got his memory back after"..."  --Wasn't 21:32, January 31, 2011 (UTC)
 
 Relationships Section 
 Bruno needs a relationships section; his relation ship with ZONE, with Yusei, the others, etc. I'd do it myself, but I fail at editing and coding.  —This unsigned comment was made by  66.75.81.157  ( talk  •  contribs ) 02:25, 8 February 2011 (UTC)

 Real name 
 masyuu_nemunemu on Twitter  posted  settei which says that Bruno's real name is Johnny and he's a member of Team Delta. masyuu_nemunemu has  Shuji Maruyama  listed as a his real name. Can we assume that he is the Shuji Maruyama involved in making 5D's and that this information is true?  Katsumi Ono  has  said  that "Z-one" and "Aporia" are code names, so I'm sure we can assume that "Antinomy" and "Paradox" are also code names. --  Deltaneos  ( talk ) 15:21, April 3, 2011 (UTC)
 
 THIS IS TRUE. Uh, I believe why they named Antinomy/Dark Glass/Bruno such a mundane name such as "Johnny" is to follow the long-standing YGO tradition of combining two characters' names and forming the Japanese word for friendship, YuuJou. In DM there was YUUgi and JOUnouchi. In GX there was Juudai YUUki and JOHan. And now for 5D's there is YUUsei and JOHnny (as Bruno is more or less a blue-haired Johan. :/)  Huajun Chen  ( talk  •  contribs ) 01:58, June 8, 2011 (UTC) 
 Alright cool and thanks for dropping by. I've updated the page to mention Johnny and Team Delta. if anyone disagrees can they please let me know here? --  Deltaneos  ( talk ) 11:09, June 9, 2011 (UTC) 
 Amount of debuts 
 Is it really necessary to post two debuts in the infobox; One for his first Vizor appearance and one for his first Bruno appearance? It's the same character both times, just dressed different and doing different things. --  Deltaneos  ( talk ) 12:51, August 16, 2011 (UTC)
 
 I think it's just like Aporia. Aporia appeared in... what? Episode 134? But technically he also appeared in 65 as the three individual tenors. I think it's a good idea to leave Dark Glass' appearance for people who aren't as familiar with the anime as we are.  Huajun Chen  ( talk  •  contribs ) 16:23, September 11, 2011 (UTC)
