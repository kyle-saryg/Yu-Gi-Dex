 Summary 
 Pegasus  continues to read  Yugi 's mind in their Duel. Pegasus plays " Toon World ", turning his  monsters  into  Toon Monsters . Yugi knows from Pegasus' Duel with  Kaiba  that this is a powerful card.
 Meanwhile,  Bakura , under the control of  Yami Bakura , leaves the group to search for  Tristan . He finds him with  Mokuba 's body and being cornered by two guards. Bakura uses " Chain Energy " to trap the guards, allowing him and Tristan to escape. However while trying to escape, they quickly reach a dead end.
 
 Featured Duel: Yami Yugi vs. Maximillion Pegasus 
 
 This Duel uses  Duelist Kingdom  gameplay. Rules and  card effects  may differ from that of the  TCG / OCG . See the individual card articles for more information.     
 Duel continues from the previous episode . 
 Yugi  has 1800  LP  remaining and  controls  a  Set   monster  and no other Set cards. His hand contains "Summoned Skull", "Celtic Guardian", "Spellbinding Circle", "Magical Hats" and "Horned Imp". 
 Pegasus  has 2000 LP remaining and controls " Ryu-Ran " and " Red Archery Girl " (1400/1500) both in  Defense Position  and a Set card.
 Turn 7: Yami Yugi 
Yugi Sets a card and  Normal Summons  " Summoned Skull " (2500/1200) in Defense Position.
 Turn 8: Pegasus 
Pegasus  draws . He then  switches  "Ryu-Ran" to  Attack Position . "Ryu-Ran"  attacks  "Summoned Skull", but Yugi  activates  his face-down " Spellbinding Circle " to forbid "Ryu-Ran" from attacking or changing its  battle position  and decrease its  ATK  by 700 ("Ryu-Ran": 2200 → 1500/2600).
 Turn 9: Yami Yugi 
Yugi draws. He then switches "Summoned Skull" to Attack Position. "Summoned Skull" attacks "Ryu-Ran", but Pegasus activates his face-down " Trap Displacement " to transfer the  effect  of "Spellbinding Circle" to "Summoned Skull". This forbids "Summoned Skull" from attacking or changing its battle position and decreases its ATK by 700 ("Summoned Skull": 2500 → 1800/1200, "Ryu-Ran": 1500 → 2200/2600). "Ryu-Ran" then  destroys  "Summoned Skull" (Yugi: 1800 → 1400 LP).
 Turn 10: Pegasus 
Pegasus draws. He then activates " Toon World ", transforming "Red Archery Girl" and "Ryu-Ran" into their  Toon  counterparts: " Toon Mermaid " (1400/1500) and " Manga Ryu-Ran " (2200/2600) respectively. "Manga Ryu-Ran" attacks and destroys Yugi's Set " Giant Soldier of Stone ". Pegasus then uses the effect of "Toon World" to hide "Manga Ryu-Ran" within its pages. This means that Yugi cannot attack "Manga Ryu-Ran" while it's within "Toon World". Pegasus then switches "Toon Mermaid" to Attack Position.
 Turn 11: Yami Yugi 
Yugi draws. He then Normal Summons " Celtic Guardian " (1400/1200) in Attack Position. "Celtic Guardian" attacks "Toon Mermaid", with Yugi intending to destroy both monsters in a  Double KO  as they have equal ATK. However, only "Celtic Guardian" is destroyed because Toon monsters cannot be  destroyed by battle  with non-Toon monsters. Pegasus then uses the effect of "Toon World" to hide "Toon Mermaid" within its pages. This means that Yugi cannot attack "Toon Mermaid" while it's within "Toon World".
 Turn 12: Pegasus 
Pegasus draws. He sets two cards.
 Turn 13: Yami Yugi 
Yugi draws. Yugi's  hand  contains " Feral Imp ", " Monster Recovery ", " Magical Hats " and " Horn Imp ". Yugi Sets "Horn Imp". Pegasus activates his  face-down  " Gorgon's Eye ",  flipping  "Horn Imp" (1300/1000)  face-up  and turning it to stone. While "Gorgon's Eye" is face-up on the field, when a Defense Position monster Yugi controls is destroyed, Yugi will take  effect damage  equal to half that monster's  DEF .
 Turn 14: Pegasus 
Pegasus draws. He then activates his face-down " Doppleganger " and  targets  Yugi's "Summoned Skull" for the effect of "Doppleganger". "Doppleganger" is  Special Summoned  as "Summoned Skull" (2500/1200) in Attack Position. "Toon World" then transforms "Summoned Skull" into " Toon Summoned Skull " (2500/1200). "Toon Summoned Skull" attacks and destroys "Horn Imp". The effect of "Gorgon's Eye" activates (Yugi: 1400 → 900 LP). Pegasus then uses the effect of "Toon World" to hide "Toon Summoned Skull" within the pages of "Toon World".
 Turn 15: Yami Yugi 
Yugi draws " Dark Magician ".
 Duel continues in the next episode . 
 
 Errors 
 Before Pegasus activates " Toon World ", his " Ryu-Ran " is shown to be horizontal, suggesting  Defense Position , even though he just attacked Yugi's " Summoned Skull " with it. 
 Differences in adaptations 
 The hexagram design of " Trap Displacement " is replaced by a circle with hieroglyphics in it in the dub. 
 The guard's guns are removed in the dub. 
 The eye of " Gorgon's Eye " on the card is changed from red to blue in the dub. 
 " Doppleganger " is slightly changed in the dub.
