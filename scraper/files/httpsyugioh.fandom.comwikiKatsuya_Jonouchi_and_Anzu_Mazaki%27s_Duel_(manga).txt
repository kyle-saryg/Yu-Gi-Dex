 Katsuya Jonouchi  and  Anzu Mazaki  faced each other in a game of  Duel Monsters , once in the  Yu-Gi-Oh!  manga .
 Most of the Duel took place off panel. Anzu easily won, due to Jonouchi's unbalance pure- monster  Deck.

 Events 
 The Duel 
 Jonouchi  Summoned  " Rock Ogre Grotto #1 " in  Attack Mode  and bragged about how strong it was.
 Anzu activated " Wind of the Gods ", eroding Jonouchi's monster into dust and blowing it away. This caused Jonouchi's  Life Points  to drop to 0 and Anzu to win.
 
 Aftermath 
 Jonouchi threw his cards in the air in frustration, as Anzu called him lame.
 Jonouchi begged  Yugi  to tell him what he was doing wrong, so Yugi took a look at his Deck and was surprised to find it contained only  Monster Cards . Jonouchi grinned that he stuffed it with the toughest monsters he could find. However Yugi explained that the biggest strategy in the game is combining monsters with  Spell Cards  and if someone fights with monsters alone, the opponent can easily dodge their attacks. Jonouchi thought about that and then begged Yugi to help make him better, so Yugi invited him over to  his house  after school, since the  Japanese National Duel Monsters Championship  was on TV that night.
