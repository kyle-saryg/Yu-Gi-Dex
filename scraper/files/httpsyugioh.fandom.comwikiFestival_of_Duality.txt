 Etymology 
 Onmyō  (陰陽) represents cosmic dual forces, like the  Yin and yang  or the sun and moon. This may make reference to the  Duel Priest  representing a negative force (the yin or the moon/night) and the  Duel Priestess  a positive one (the yang or the sun/day).
 
 Story 
 The Ritual Duel used to be conducted between a  Duel Priest  and a  Duel Priestess  inside the  Aerial Fortress Seibal , and it involves the ressurection of the  Ultimate God . It used to be held annually 5000 years prior to the manga's present, with the Duel Priestess' win being a tradition. However, after  Akiza's predecessor  lost following  Rex Goodwin 's wish, a disaster occurred, and the ritual was never conducted again, until Rex and  Roman  conducted it once more in modern times. [1]  It was said that the enshrined deity of the ritual would grant any single wish they desire once they reach the end of the ritual, with Rex and Roman becoming Duel Priests in order to win the ritual and wish for  Ish , who had been offered as a sacrifice for the ritual, to return. [2] 
 
 Flow 
 The Ritual is begun with the  Turbo Duel  between a Duel Priest and Priestess towards Seibal, whose winner is declared the King of Earth's Lock (Supreme King of the Earthbound Lock in the Japanese version). [1]  Then, inside the Fortress, two more Duels occur between Duel Priests: one in the Corridor of the Northern Sky and one in the Corridor of the Southern Sky. The winners of these Duels Duel against each other, and the final winner becomes the King of Sky's Lock (Supreme King of the Heavenly Lock in the Japanese version). [3]  Both Kings then Duel each other in a final Turbo Duel toward the  Ultimate God 's tower. Meanwhile, the defeated Duel Priestess is offered to the Ultimate God as a sacrifice. [4]  The outcome of the Duel decides whether the Ultimate God will be resurrected or sealed again, and the final winner becomes the "King Who Unlocks" (Supreme King of the Unlocking in the Japanese version). [5]  Once the ritual is done, a voice, presumably the voice of the enshrined deity of the ritual, talks to the winner, asking them which wish they want granted. [6]
