 "Advent of the Ultimate Life-Form!!"  is the fifteenth chapter of the  Yu-Gi-Oh! R  manga. It was first printed in Japan on June 20, 2005 in  V Jump  magazine. It was later reprinted in volume 2 of Yu-Gi-Oh! R.
 Kaiba  defeats  Willa  and gains entrance to the building.
 
 Featured Duel: Seto Kaiba vs. Willa Mette 
 Duel continues from  the previous chapter. 
 Turn 6: Willa 
 Willa  switches both " Axe Dragonute " and " Lancer Dragonute " to  Attack Position . He then  activates  " Union Attack ", allowing "Lancer Dragonute" and "Axe Dragonute" to  attack  one  monster  together, with their  ATK  equal to their combined ATK - 3500, though no  Battle Damage  will be inflicted. They attack and  destroy  " Swordstalker ".
 Turn 7: Kaiba 
 Kaiba  activates his  face-down  " Silent Doom ",  Special Summoning  the " Blade Knight " (1600/1000) from his  Graveyard  in  Defense Position . He  Sets  a card and activates " Cost Down ", decreasing the  Level  of every  monster  in his  hand  by 2. He  Tributes  "Blade Knight" to  Normal Summon  the now-Level 6 " Blue-Eyes White Dragon " (3000/2500) in Attack Position. It attacks "Lancer Dragonute", but Willa activates his face-down " Delayed Summon ", Tributing his two monsters to  Normal Summon  " White-Horned Dragon " (2200/1500) from his hand in Attack Position as he did not Summon last turn. Its effect activates, increasing its ATK by that of "Blue-Eyes White Dragon", to 5200, as the latter card uses magical attacks. A  replay  occurs and Kaiba opts not to attack. At the End Phase, the ATK of "White-Horned Dragon" returns to its  original value .
 Turn 8: Willa 
Willa activates the effect of "White-Horned Dragon", increasing its ATK by that of "Blue-Eyes White Dragon", to 5200, as the latter card uses magical attacks. It attacks, but Kaiba activates his face-down " Magical Trick Mirror " to copy the effect of the " Synchronic Ability " in Willa's Graveyard. "Blue-Eyes" gains the effect of "White-Horned", increasing its ATK by that of the latter monster 8200 (Willa 4000 → 0)
