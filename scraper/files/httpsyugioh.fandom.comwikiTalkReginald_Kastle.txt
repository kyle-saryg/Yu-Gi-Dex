 Name 
 I saw the trailer, and it does indeed say "Ayer Shark" when the opposing side says "Yuma". But couldn't it just be  engrish  for " Aero Shark "?  Cheesedude  ( talk  •  contribs )
 
 V Jump is calling him "Ryoga" (I think the surname is "Kamishiro"). According to  XYZ on BBS , "Shark" (シャーク) is his nickname. Maybe "Ayer" is part of the nickname too. --  Deltaneos  ( talk ) 01:19, December 21, 2010 (UTC)
 According to someone on the Janime forums, the boards says "Player" above Yuma's name. The "p" and the "l" are cut off on Ryoga's side, so it looks like "Ayer". "Shark" is indeed underneath it. So "Shark" does seem to be a nickname (or one hell of a bizarre first name). So I think that's our answer.  Cheesedude  ( talk  •  contribs ) 01:31, December 21, 2010 (UTC) 
 Poseidon Waves/Zeus Breath 
 Is it possible that  Zeus Breath  is the anime version of  Poseidon Waves ? They are very similar in terms of artwork & effect, and both are also Normal Trap Cards. If that's the case, then there shouldn't be two different pages, just put Zeus Breath under anime appearance for Poseidon Waves, and state that it appears with slightly different artwork and a different name....  114.58.254.44  ( talk ) 03:45, April 14, 2011 (UTC)

 I think there is no need for a link for a separated deck page. His deck section already exists as a part of this article and it is not big enough to have a separated page yet. And... how do you know he has a Duel Runner? It looks like a motorbike from future, and a Duel Runner is a machine from 5D's not ZEXAL. -- 212.200.217.150  ( talk ) 23:38, May 30, 2011 (UTC)
 
 Agree with removing those links. Also, are different character's D-Pads and D-Gazers individual enough to even have their own articles? (I'm not very up-to-date with  ZEXAL , so I'm not sure.) --  Deltaneos  ( talk ) 23:45, May 30, 2011 (UTC) 
 Agreed. When some ZEXAL games come out, we can split the article into a Deck article. At this point, I'd say no about individual D-Gazers and Disks. There are nothing but some color variations at this point (and Tokunosuke's glasses gazer). I changed "Duel Runner" to "motorcycle", as we don't know that it's a Duel Runner at this point.

 Ryoga's Deck 
 I've posted  something  before with regards to it, which is why his Deck is previously listed as "Sea Creatures'. I believe it still holds true, with the lack of WATER-specific support and more on the Fish/Aqua/Sea Serpents, and the existence of DARK (and in the DT (probably in future episodes), WIND) monsters. What do you think?  MarxMayhem  ( talk  •  contribs ) 13:58, October 16, 2011 (UTC)
 
 Ryoga's Sister/Friend 
 In the article, on trivia section, it says that Ryoga has similarity to joey Wheeler as in having to enter a tournament for his Sister/Friend in hospital. Where is the sources for this?  —This unsigned comment was made by  Scourge The Hedgehog  ( talk  •  contribs ) 05:08, November 9, 2011 
 
 Rival? 
 In the anime ryoga can be seen as a rival of yuma but kaito is also a rival so its more like ryoga is the rival of yuma and kaito the rival of astral-- Yugx5dszexal  ( talk  •  contribs ) 03:34, December 16, 2011 (UTC) 
 
 Trivia 
 why was that taken off?  24.83.215.20  ( talk ) 21:45, April 6, 2012 (UTC)
 
 Rename? 
 I don't think this page should be called "Shark". There is also the archetype Shark. In the japanese Anime many people like his sister, the Arclight family, the math teacher and all his fangirls call him by his real name just Yuma and the Numbers Club are still saying Shark. Also a purple-haired kid is definitely not the first thing normal people think of when they hear the word Shark, they think of the animals called Sharks.  Dunkles Magiermädchen  ( talk  •  contribs ) 18:02, June 18, 2012 (UTC)
 
 Shark  is already the redirect page to this one because when people think of the word "Shark" in context to Yu-Gi-Oh!, they most likely are thinking of this character, not the archetype. During Duels in the anime the system lists his name as  Shark . What secondary characters call him is less important than what the main characters call him. And for consistency sake with the rest of the site, we should rename this page Shark. -- Golden Key  ( talk  •  contribs ) 19:28, June 19, 2012 (UTC)
 Yeah, you're right but in my opinion it is just a little bit strange to name someone's character page after an animal.  Dunkles Magiermädchen  ( talk  •  contribs ) 18:22, June 25, 2012 (UTC) 
 I do agree that it does seem sort of odd, but I also agree that we should move the article. On that note,  Keith Howard  should be moved to Bandit Keith.  Cheesedude  ( talk  •  contribs ) 22:55, June 25, 2012 (UTC) 
 Reginals is his name. Shark is his nickname. We put the actual names of characters on their pages. And Shark is already an archetytpe. ( Meklordsa5m  ( talk  •  contribs ) 14:43, June 26, 2012 (UTC))
 
 I disagreed because of their "first introduce" has being post here. We didn't know who was "Bruno" until his memory returned to him. Same for Tron and V. Reginald however was revealed first so that name stuck here. -- i F r e d C a t  15:02, June 26, 2012 (UTC) 
 Going by what a character was first introduced as is an alternative to going by a character's most referred to name. Both have about equal merit, I'd say, and either way, Keith Howard gets changed to Bandit Keith. We should decide which to make the "rule" for the site. I'm still in favor of renaming this page just "Shark". At the very least, all instances on this particular page should refer to him as Shark rather than Reginald. It looks weird for him to be referred to by a name he's rarely called. -- Golden Key  ( talk  •  contribs ) 15:43, June 26, 2012 (UTC) 
 Golden Key is right. There needs to be a rule that says weather or not to put either their proper name or their most used name. V and Tron are still like that because it says in the anime that they all changed their names since tron came. So I would stay with Regindald but there needs to be  rule. ( Meklordsa5m  ( talk  •  contribs ) 16:30, June 26, 2012 (UTC))
 
 You got a point, Goldy - but with Meklord's considering; I still stood my vote - No. -- i F r e d C a t  16:38, June 26, 2012 (UTC) 
 Actually Mekords, there is NO consensus on what to do in these cases. And no consistency. If we put the character's real names, Bruno's article would be called Johnny. And no, Tron and V are not at those names because they changed their names. They didn't. They use codenames. There is a difference. Also, seeing as a move-war is already starting, I'm move-locking this (it shouldn't be at "Shark (Character)" or "Shark (character)"). If we decide to move it, myself or another admin can move it to just "Shark".  Cheesedude  ( talk  •  contribs ) 16:59, June 26, 2012 (UTC) 
 I don't mean that - I only stated that we "started" their articles with the "first name" they confirmed. Like Bruno was first introduced as "Bruno" instead of "Johnny". Reginald was confirmed first before his "Shark" name was announcing. That's what I want this article to stay as - "Reginald Kastle", not "Shark (blah)" -- i F r e d C a t  17:09, June 26, 2012 (UTC) 
 I was still talking to Meklords, not you, Fred. And Shark came before Reginald. Ryoga came first.  Cheesedude  ( talk  •  contribs ) 17:18, June 26, 2012 (UTC) 
 Well, then making them in correct order. But you give a point; Ryoga was replacing by Reginald due to Dub-whatever and we had our old rulings to rename/replace them all from Japan into English, no? In that case, that's why I voted no in the first place; we are keeping this article in his own name instead of his own "code". -- i F r e d C a t  17:20, June 26, 2012 (UTC) 
 What about  Reginald "Shark" Kastle ? Nickname in quotes between given name and surname is a common convention for people who are often referred to by a nickname. Nickname alone is usually used when they're almost exclusively referred to by their nickname. 
 I don't think using the first name introduced is a good idea. It's possible for someone to be introduced using an alias, which goes on to have little significance on their overall appearance. Basing it on their more common name is better in my opinion. --  Deltaneos  ( talk ) 19:19, June 26, 2012 (UTC) 
 Now, I give a "Yes" vote only to Delta's idea - as I have writing few chapter and some characters had same affect as what he was explaining. -- i F r e d C a t  19:23, June 26, 2012 (UTC) 
 Following those guidelines, Bruno and the Tron family keep their names the way they are and Keith Howard gets moved to Bandit Keith, correct? I'm fine with this, since it brings consistency. -- Golden Key  ( talk  •  contribs ) 19:33, June 26, 2012 (UTC) 
 That's because Keith Howard got renaming into Bandit Keith by following Dub name. Tron's family didn't because they are yet to be revealing or if that is so, keep their name same, like Yusei Fudo/Jack Atlas. -- i F r e d C a t  19:35, June 26, 2012 (UTC) 
 I also agree with Deltaneos' idea.  Reginald "Shark" Kastle  sounds much better than  Shark (character) .-- Dunkles Magiermädchen  ( talk  •  contribs ) 14:54, June 27, 2012 (UTC) 
 I like that idea too. But do note that the article would just be at "Shark", not "Shark (character)".  Cheesedude  ( talk  •  contribs ) 17:02, June 27, 2012 (UTC) 
 Flip  and  Flip ? -- i F r e d C a t  17:21, June 27, 2012 (UTC) 
 The character isn't automatically the one that gets parenthesis. Its whatever the "less-likely" search term is. If you search "Flip", you expect the action, not the character. If you search "Shark" you're more likely to expect the character, not the archetype. So the archetype gets the parenthesis.  Cheesedude  ( talk  •  contribs ) 17:33, June 27, 2012 (UTC) 
 Ok, if there is a card that get "Shark" as name - it will be like this "Shark (card)", since of " Invader of Darkness ". -- i F r e d C a t  17:41, June 27, 2012 (UTC) 
 I agree into renaming it. Why not make it a majority vote? -- SharkTenjo   —Preceding undated comment added 00:34, June 29, 2012 (UTC) 
 We should  rename it 
 74.139.22.168  ( talk ) 17:41, July 14, 2012 (UTC)andrew
 I believe it should just be Reginald "Shark" Kastle. It would make alot of sense to name this article that.  —This unsigned comment was made by  Computer Bug  ( talk  •  contribs ) 14:51, July 24, 2012 
 
 Reginald "Shark" Kastle  seems to be the favoured name above. But it was  called that  once back in March and  reverted  soon afterwards. I'm just wondering if Cheesedude or anyone still disagrees with that name or should we finally get on with it and rename the page? --  Deltaneos  ( talk ) 16:23, October 15, 2012 (UTC) 
 I don't really like it, but I have no reason to disagree other than "I don't like how it looks". So I say go ahead.  Cheesedude  ( talk  •  contribs ) 16:34, October 15, 2012 (UTC) 
 If that's the best alternative we're going to get, then I vote for just keeping it as it is. -- Golden Key  ( talk  •  contribs ) 02:12, October 16, 2012 (UTC) 
 Shark's voice 
 Isn't Shark voiced by Wayne Grayson? It's currently shown as "Gary Mack", but his voice sounds the same as Grady and Jean from 5D's.  RedDrgn  ( talk  •  contribs ) 23:10, October 28, 2012 (UTC)
 
 Relationships 
 My Relationships section for this article was shot down because it was "poorly written". Though I cannot understand why someone thought this was the case, I will not protest it; however, I still think this page should include Shark's relationships with Rio, Yuma and Quattro (and possibly other characters, like Scorch and Chills).  RedDrgn  ( talk  •  contribs ) 02:46, November 14, 2012 (UTC)
 
 I personally thought it was well written and contained things worth noting. I would like to hear the opinions of others before I restore it, though. -- Golden Key  ( talk  •  contribs ) 02:53, November 14, 2012 (UTC)

 Implied Barian/Ambiguous Human 
 Everybody haves noted, but Shark haves a similar appearance to Nasch, one of seven Barians Emperors, also Astral has questioned the nature of Rio and Shark as humans, also they aura are be used to repairs Durbe BariaLapis, also Rio haves Barian powers and Shark without Astral or the Emperor Key (Yuma tanks both) obtains a Chaos Numeber (Natural not rank-up). Is not coincidence, Astral (the most improbable) or Ventrix influence (despite begin very probable), both really haves barian powers. Conclusion
 
 Nasch or possible Merag are mother/father of Rio and Shark. 
 Nasch/Merag go to earth to do experiences whit humans and chose Rio and Shark (and possible Haruto) as subjects gaining barian powers in the process. Can be divide in:
 Go to earth in intentions of search of Numeron code or the numbers and uses the humans to thys. 
 Nasch/Merag are studding the humans and resolves do experiments. 
 The first can be sustained by the fact of Rio and Shark parents are not appears in the serie and Shark haves similar appearance to Nasch. But the second are more plausible. but we can't forgot the summary of episode 109 in the end haves: "while confused over a recurring hallucination that keeps appearing. During the fierce battle, Rio Summons "Number 73: Abyss Splash the Roaring Waterfall Deity"!! Caught in the impact, Durbe and Astral see for themselves the hallucination tormenting Shark." The hallucination(A.K.A possible Nasch/Merag link whit Shark and Rio) sustains my theory of Nasch/Merag haves doing alterations on both, implanting (on purpose or accidentally) or just in consequences of experiments. In my personal opinion both are possible, coll if Shark number Barian Chaos Number whit Barian Force.  Dragonempeorslayer  ( talk  •  contribs ) 23:17, June 6, 2013 (UTC)
 
 The reason why Shark got C32 was because of  Number 32 , therefore that don't making him Barian. -- i F r e d C a t  23:40, June 6, 2013 (UTC) 
 That or Nasch would be the father of Shark/Rio, like Dr. Fudo is to Yusei Fudo (they have similar hair style, so why not?) -- i F r e d C a t  20:43, June 10, 2013 (UTC) 
 it dosent make much sense for Nasch/Merag to be thier father because 
1) why would Rio/Shark have memories of thier parent past lives? 
2) all the barians are depectied as humans(in the past a current) as relativly young people, around the same age as shark/rio 
3) why would they look exactly the same as thier parent past human selves? 70.191.246.23  ( talk ) 19:03, June 16, 2013 (UTC)
 
 So you're tell me that Nasch/Merag can split their personality just like Vector had done with  Rei Shingetsu ? -- i F r e d C a t  19:09, June 16, 2013 (UTC) 
 1) Some studies by scientists have shown that sometimes memories can be passed genetically (real studies, not just hours of Assassins Creed) 
 2) Nasch/Merag would have been young at some point in there lives. 
 3) Dopplegangers, and again genetics, a fair few people look like their parents. Photonkrios99  ( talk  •  contribs ) 19:24, June 16, 2013 (UTC) 
 Nasch/Shark 
 If it is true that Shark is Nasch, why is there a page (and links) to Nasch article?  E n e r g y   X   ∞  18:32, June 16, 2013 (UTC)
 
 Have you not read the above topic? Is my respond too neglect to noting? -- i F r e d C a t  18:38, June 16, 2013 (UTC)
 Well well well Mr Almighty FredCat100, it's about time you accept the merging of the two pages already. Shark admitted he is Barian, his Barian form is shown in episode 122 along with Merag and even Han Megumi said so. Please don't tell me you want to wait until Nasch explicitly says "I am freaking Shark for god's sake" to Yuma and the audience's face then you're willing to comply. 
 It is certainly not good when you're not willing to compromise at all and try to exploit your authoritarian status. What you're looking for now is similar to a tissue box having the words "tissue box" for you understand that it's a freaking tissue box or needing to confirm whether the word "word" exists by asking a Professor of the English Language. It's absurd, but if you still want to wait two more weeks for Nasch to say that he is shark and Merag to say she is Rio right in your face before you're willing to merge them, then fine by me. Not that it really matters, but you're shaming yourself.  Samhiuy  ( talk  •  contribs ) 11:36, September 22, 2013 (UTC) 
 there is no official proof they are related and also why would their names change all the other barians keep their same name20:27, June 17, 2013 (UTC)~
 
 Don't make sense merge the page if this is proved, Nasch is a evil side like Yami Marik, that haves a separated page-- Dragonempeorslayer  ( talk  •  contribs ) 01:27, September 2, 2013 (UTC) 
 There's no proof the Nasch is an "evil side", thats no more than speculation. F8lfire  ( talk  •  contribs ) 02:49, September 2, 2013 (UTC)

 Yes, that is true, not could be, because Reginald never knew he was Nasch, but now he called himself Nasch and people did as well. There is no doubt, but to say Reginald is not Reginald, he is Nasch.-- Shadowdarkone1  ( talk  •  contribs ) 19:44, September 8, 2013 (UTC) 
 What are you talking about? Shark and Nasch are the same person, its just that Shark is starting to get the memories of his past life back. Shark will always be Shark, but he will apparently be Nasch as well.  NMBRHNTR64  ( talk  •  contribs ) 19:51, September 8, 2013 (UTC)

 Leaving name as Reginald Kastle? 
 Shouldn't we rename this article Nasch? It seems more fitting considering that Shark doesn't see himself as Reginald anymore. Also, the  Seven Barian Emperors  Article calls him Nasch. Over-HundredLegendaryChaosShiningNumbers  ( talk  •  contribs ) 01:53, September 27, 2013 (UTC)
 i agree. the seven barian emperors pages have there barian name and barian picture. ( Superlmno  ( talk  •  contribs ) 02:37, September 27, 2013 (UTC))
 
 "Nasch" should only be a redirect. We know Shark more as "Shark" than "Nasch". Same thing for Rio/Merag.  HPZ - O.N.E.  ( talk  •  contribs ) 02:43, September 27, 2013 (UTC)

 Read this . No, this isn't Wikipedia, but this is always going to be my stance on such issues - use the most common name. Most of time, that is also a character's real name. In cases like this, it isn't.  Cheesedude  ( talk  •  contribs ) 03:07, September 27, 2013 (UTC) 
 Everything about this statement +1 Although if say ZeXal goes on for another 100+ episodes with him consistently being called Nasch ;) XD -- slave ( command )  03:55, September 27, 2013 (UTC) 
 Well then if your using that argument, the page should be named  Shark ... as thats his most common name, Ryoga/terrible dub name isnt used as much.-- RexGodwin  ( talk  •  contribs ) 00:39, September 28, 2013 (UTC)
 Hmm, good point. Both Reginald Kastle and Nasch are born names/pseudonyms, where as Shark is a nick name, does Shark count as an ambiguous name? if not then I suppose it is more common than both of the more, er "official" names... Gah IDK I think I'll leave this be -- slave ( command )  01:34, September 28, 2013 (UTC)
 all the barian pages are named for there barian name. since shark and rio are barians, they need there barian names. ( Superlmno  ( talk  •  contribs ) 01:41, September 29, 2013 (UTC))
 
 If we are actually going by the "common name" thing, then the page should be renamed "Shark", as that is his most common name. Otherwise, we wouldn't be following "common name" and we should use the true name, Nasch.  NMBRHNTR64  ( talk  •  contribs ) 17:12, September 29, 2013 (UTC) 
 Both are his true names, so I don't see why Nasch is the better option. The reason they don't want to use Shark is because it looks more professional to use a character's full name rather than a nickname. Or it could be called Reginald "Shark" Castle.  Simple Guillotine  ( talk  •  contribs ) 17:19, September 29, 2013 (UTC) 
 "The reason they don't want to use Shark is because it looks more professional to use a character's full name rather than a nickname." see all of the Arclight family. F8lfire  ( talk  •  contribs ) 17:25, September 29, 2013 (UTC)
 
 They don't have their real names revealed in the dub; I think.  Simple Guillotine  ( talk  •  contribs ) 17:28, September 29, 2013 (UTC) 
 V/Chris did in the dub. The other two went unrevealed. Regardless, they were called those names for all of one episode. Shark has been called Nasch, for like two episodes now (maybe like six if you count Durbe's previous speculation). Not enough to be moving the article. No one knows him as Nasch. Most fans are still gonna call him Shark, not Nasch. Common search terms make the best article names.  Cheesedude  ( talk  •  contribs ) 20:44, September 29, 2013 (UTC) 
 But in this case, the common name is Shark.  NMBRHNTR64  ( talk  •  contribs ) 20:47, September 29, 2013 (UTC) 
 "Shark" VS "Reginald Kastle" was discussed  before  and was pretty inconclusive. If we're reopening it, I also think "Shark" is the better choice, common name etc., and is better than the midway 'Reginald "Shark" Kastle'. --  Deltaneos  ( talk ) 12:02, September 30, 2013 (UTC) 
 I agree, but I think that is mostly because I hate his English name so much. But calling the page by his nickname just makes more sense as that is his "common name".  NMBRHNTR64  ( talk  •  contribs ) 12:22, October 1, 2013 (UTC) 
 I think depending on Ryoga's role for the rest of the series, we should open up this argument again. Considering he has accepted he is truly Nasch, and has lived as Nasch for like 3 lives now, compared to Ryoga's 1?
(original human  Nasch -original Barian  Nasch - Ryoga -2nd Barian  Nasch ). And depending on if he will come back to being a human and ally again, or if he tragically dies as a Barian.-- RexGodwin  ( talk  •  contribs ) 04:41, October 2, 2013 (UTC)
 
 I agree with you. We should change this page's name to Nasch as that is his true name, also when he was first born (not reincarnations, but his true first life's name) and ignoring Yuma and his dumb friends, Shark is/was only his nickname. We should change, but the page will redirect to Nasch.-- Shadowdarkone1  ( talk  •  contribs ) 01:44, October 6, 2013 (UTC) 
 If we rename Shark as "Nasch" then we'll have to rename Judai's page to "Supreme King" as it is his real identity according to this policy. So no, let's keep the current name with "Shark" and "Nasch" as a redirect.  HPZ - O.N.E.  ( talk  •  contribs ) 02:21, October 6, 2013 (UTC) 
 Well you^ clearly must not have payed attention then cause its not that simple...-- RexGodwin  ( talk  •  contribs ) 02:36, October 6, 2013 (UTC)
 
 Enlighten me then. Also.. Isn't the case of  Yami Yugi  and  Atem  the exact same case ? There are the exact same person (= same soul) but they have two pages..  HPZ - O.N.E.  ( talk  •  contribs ) 02:57, October 6, 2013 (UTC) 
 As a side note, what is the deal with when "Shark" was reliving his past life when he got #73 & #94, I believe he and Rio where called Ryouga and Rio not Nasch and Merag? was that because the memory was incomplete and he assumed/filled in the lack of a name mentioned with his own type thing Ala Yami Yugi before he discovered his true name...? I jsut feel that is kind of relevant to the whole " (original human  Nasch -original Barian  Nasch - Ryoga -2nd Barian  Nasch ) " argument... which I am not sure how much that actually changes things (from what viewers of the show actually see, he is called Shark the majority time anyway...) -- slave ( command )  02:42, October 6, 2013 (UTC) 
 Although Nasch and Merag would be nicer than their current names solely for consistency with the other Barian Emperors (yes I know there names are more common than there other if any other names) -- slave ( command )  02:44, October 6, 2013 (UTC) 
 Shark was actually reliving those memories directly. He was in control of what Nasch was doing. He was the one who called Rio by the name "Rio", since he'd have no idea her name was Merag. She and the soldiers were confused as to why he's acting so weird. Then he figures out what's going on and just goes with it, so his actions probably mirrored what Nasch actually did in the past from then on.

 Separate 
 Since nasch and merag are different people from shark and rio (most likely shark and rio are nasch and merag decedents), i think we should separate there pages ( Superlmno  ( talk  •  contribs ) 02:35, November 25, 2013 (UTC))
 
 See  here .  Cheesedude  ( talk  •  contribs ) 02:46, November 25, 2013 (UTC) 
 still, they had there own lives before they became one. so we have to make pages so represent who they were. ( Superlmno  ( talk  •  contribs ) 02:56, November 25, 2013 (UTC))
 
 In the future, please read the link that a person gives before replying. You clearly didn't, as Cheesedude didn't say anything about  not  splitting on that Talk Page. He agrees that they should be split (and so do I), but he wants to move the "Reginald Kastle" page to "Nasch", and create a new page for the real Reginald Kastle that died as a child. (This is because almost all of the content on the "Reginald Kastle" page is relevant to Nasch only.) -- UltimateKuriboh  ( talk  •  contribs ) 03:03, November 25, 2013 (UTC) 
 Yes and no. "Reginald Kastle" and "Reginald Kastle (original)".  Cheesedude  ( talk  •  contribs ) 03:09, November 25, 2013 (UTC) 
 I know he agrees, i'm just saying. plus i think we should wait a little while before separating. because episode 136 says it well reveal the rest of the vector and nasch memories. it will probably reveal to us why shark and rio look so much like nasch and merag human form(probably because there the decedents of those 2).

 That seems to be the case. Shark says in 114 that the crest on his family's grave is the same as the symbol of Nasch's kingdom. So its likely he is descended...from himself.  Cheesedude  ( talk  •  contribs ) 18:59, November 25, 2013 (UTC) 
 so nasch and merag entered the bodys of there decedents. plus theres more proof to back this up. shark and rio's mom has the same hair color as dumon's. which means that dumon and merag in there past life's might have had a child or 2 before vector attack nasch's kingdom, but merag having the power to sense danger, decided to send her children away for safety before vector came. ( Superlmno  ( talk  •  contribs ) 19:26, November 25, 2013 (UTC)) 
 Dear lord stop that right now. THAT is speculation in red alerts. Yes, his current form is likely descended from...himself...(being your own great-great-great(etc) granddad...that's enough to give anyone a headache) but it is also likely that there were other parts of the royal family that gave birth to his current body. Or, as Nasch was the only survivor of the battle between him and Vector, he could have had a child himself. Also we don't know the exact circumstances of his revival; we need subs. Even so, no more talk about exact lineage. That will come if and when it is brought up in the anime.  Aeron Solo wuz here   (If you wanna talk)  19:32, November 25, 2013 (UTC) 
 come on cheesedude, back me up here. ( Superlmno  ( talk  •  contribs ) 19:24, November 26, 2013 (UTC)) 
 I was not saying we should add all that, no. A split? Yes. Actually saying "his descendant?" No.  Cheesedude  ( talk  •  contribs ) 20:36, November 26, 2013 (UTC) 
 but the other day you agreed he might be ( Superlmno  ( talk  •  contribs ) 20:59, November 26, 2013 (UTC)) 
 Yes, and I was speculating.  Cheesedude  ( talk  •  contribs ) 21:06, November 26, 2013 (UTC) 
 In my opinion, I agree in creating an article for the real "Reginald" and "Rio" who have died in car accident. Repeating what Cheesedude said, we should mention that real Reginald and Rio and their family are descendant of  Nasch  himself. I still think we should wait for upcoming episodes and not speculate. We also know not to trust  Vector  because he might be lying or tell the truth. ( Bring   it   'em  ---  User:Avatarr ) 22:40, November 26, 2013 (UTC) 
 I thought it made sense but apparently having the same body but different soul means your the same person according to  these people  (please note my issue isn't that i disagree with them it is that their reasoning is  wrong )-- slave ( command • works )  00:52, November 27, 2013 (UTC) 
 (reset indent) Further more, my edits to both of those pages have disappeared without a trace, despite me checking at the time they were there via refresh etc... WHY? 
Did someone already delete both pages and then they were re-made without restoring history ?! Either the wiki server is effing up or someone better learn to use their brain or move to somewhere in whatever society where rational thought isn't required.  </rage>  -- slave ( command • works )  01:01, November 27, 2013 (UTC)
 just because people share the same body doesnt make them the same person. look at atem and yugi( Superlmno  ( talk  •  contribs ) 02:23, November 27, 2013 (UTC))
 
 ...I'm in favour of them having separate pages I was utalising sarcasm to show how idiotic what KasaiWolf said. Apparently it was to subtle -_- -- slave ( command • works )  03:00, November 27, 2013 (UTC) 
 Ok, there is a script for that part of the episode  here . Nothing is said about them being descendants, but yes, their souls enter the bodies of the real Rio and Reginald. I am going to make (or modify if they still exist the "original" articles now.  Cheesedude  ( talk  •  contribs ) 15:55, November 27, 2013 (UTC) 
 it doesnt say there the decedents now, but it may in the next episode. ( Superlmno  ( talk  •  contribs ) 16:10, November 27, 2013 (UTC))
