 Lyrics 
 I've got the need for speed, the need for speed! 
I've got the will to win. 
Success is guaranteed. 
So let the games begin.
 You can lock me up, you can tie me down. 
Throw away the key. 
Still breakin' outta this one horse town. 
Yeah, you can't catch me. 
Revving up, driving hard. 
Put my faith in the cards.
 I've got the need for speed, the need for speed. 
I've got the will to win. 
Success is guaranteed. 
So let the games begin.
 Nothing's gonna stop me now, stop me now! 
Once I take the lead. 
Got to feed my need for speed. 
My need for speed!
