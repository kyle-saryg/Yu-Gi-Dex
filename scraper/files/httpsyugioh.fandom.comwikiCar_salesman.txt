 The  car salesman  was a character who worked in a car dealership whose name started with "Perr". The rest of the company's name was not visible. In the English version the company's name was erased entirely.
 He spotted  Seto  and  Mokuba Kaiba  getting into a sports car and ran over to ask what they were doing. Mokuba told him that they were buying it, while Kaiba filled out a check. He was handed the check and told to keep the change before the two drove off. He yelled after them to come back to no avail and found that the check was for $500,000.
