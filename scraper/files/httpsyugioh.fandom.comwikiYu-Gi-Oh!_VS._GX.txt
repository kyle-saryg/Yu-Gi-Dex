Yu-Gi-Oh! VS. GX  (遊☆戯☆王 ＶＳ. ＧＸ) is a canceled proposed film, including characters from  Yu-Gi-Oh!  and  Yu-Gi-Oh! GX ; however the idea was scrapped.
 
 Plot 
 The students of  Duel Academy  went on a field trip to  Domino City . Among them was a tarot card reader,  Sartorius , who wished to defeat  Yugi Muto  and the other legendary duelists. Strange circumstances led  Jaden Yuki  to meet Yugi Muto and  Joey Wheeler . Sartorius contacted  KaibaCorp  to plot his scheme.
 
 Development 
 The idea of the film came from  Kazuki Takahashi 's unmet expectations from seeing  Mazinger Z Vs. Devilman  in his childhood. He came up with the idea about a year after  Yu-Gi-Oh! GX  had begun broadcasting.
 Takahashi contemplated reviving Atem, but didn't want to betray the theme of the original story.
 After the idea was dropped, Takahashi commented that it was fun to see Yugi and the others in his head after such a long time and that Yugi facing Jaden couldn't happen as it would be a hero facing his comrade.
 
 Legacy 
 Takahashi mentioned the rejected film in an afterword in  volume 8  of the  bunkoban .
 Ideas from the film were used in season 2 of  Yu-Gi-Oh! GX  when Jaden and his friends do take a field trip to Domino City and Sartorius was retooled to be the villain of that season, rather than of the movie.
 Despite Takahashi's comments, the  last   two  episodes of  Yu-Gi-Oh! GX  featured Yugi dueling Jaden albeit in a different context. The two also meet in  Yu-Gi-Oh! 3D Bonds Beyond Time , along with  Yusei Fudo .  Yu-Gi-Oh! The Dark Side of Dimensions  also brings Atem back to help Yugi out.
