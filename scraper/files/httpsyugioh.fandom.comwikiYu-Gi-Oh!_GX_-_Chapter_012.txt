 Showdown! Who Will Win? 
 
 "Duelist Instinct!!" , known as  "Duelist Sense!!"  in the Japanese version, is the twelfth chapter of the  Yu-Gi-Oh! GX  manga . It was first printed in Japanese in the  V Jump  magazine and in English in the  Shonen Jump  magazine. Both of which were printed in  volume 2  of the  Yu-Gi-Oh! GX  graphic novels afterwards.
 
 Summary 
 Jaden Yuki 's flashbacks to his childhood and his duel with  Koyo Hibiki  continues. Jaden has just  Summoned  " Elemental Hero Bubbleman ". Koyo urges him to show him his best, and Jaden  activates  " Bubble Shuffle ", switching "Bubbleman" and Koyo's " Elemental Hero Voltic " to  Defense Position . It then lets him  Tribute  "Bubbleman" to  Special Summon  an " Elemental Hero " in his  hand . He Summons " Elemental Hero Bladedge ", which greatly impressed  Midori . Jaden attacks with "Bladedge", but Koyo activates his  face-down  " Hero Barrier ",  negating  the attack as he has a  face-up  "Elemental Hero" on the  field . Jaden is disappointed, but Midori comments that he forced Koyo to activate "Hero Barrier" earlier than he may have liked to, as such a card could be vital later in the duel. Koyo chides Midori for the lecture, and she responds she was just giving him such encouragement, with Koyo saying that she shouldn't meddle, and her responding that a little advice never hurt. Jaden finds this interaction interesting, saying that as an only child, he's never seen it before. Midori offers to be his big sister, and Koyo advises Jaden against it, saying that she'll talk his ear off.
 Koyo  draws , telling Jaden that his Summoning of "Bladedge" truly gave him a jump. He Summons " Elemental Hero Heat " and compares the situation to baseball game, saying that there's always a chance to come back after the opponent's pitch. He activates " Hero Pressure ", which decreases "Bladedge's" attack points by 300 for each "Elemental Hero on Koyo's side of the field. Thus, "Bladedge's" attack points are reduced to 2000. Koyo attacks with "Voltic", destroying both monsters. He then attacks  directly  with "Heat", dealing Jaden 1600 damage. Koyo states that no matter how powerful a monster is, it can always be defeated by combining cards, even if that monster is called a "God". Jaden Summons " Elemental Hero Avian " in Defense Position and Sets a card.
 Koyo activates " Pot of Greed ", drawing two cards, and then activates " Polymerization ", fusing "Heat" with the " Elemental Hero Lady Heat " in his hand to  Fusion Summon  " Elemental Hero Inferno " in Attack Position. Koyo attacks, and Jaden activates his face-down " Negate Attack ", negating the attack and ending the  Battle Phase . Jaden begins his turn, activating the " Skyscraper "  Field Spell Card ". He then plays a "Polymerization" of his own, fusing "Avian" with the " Elemental Hero Burstinatrix " in his hand to Fusion Summon " Elemental Hero Flame Wingman " in Attack Position.
