Link: https://yugioh.fandom.com/wiki/Card_colors

Yu-Gi-Oh!  cards in the  OCG ,  TCG , and various  anime series , except in the  Toei anime series , are categorized according to the color of the card's frame (the background upon which the text, artwork, and various icons are overlaid). There are 15 colors used in total (though the dark gray of  Dark Synchro Monsters  only appears in the anime): various types of  Monster Cards , as well as the non-legal  Egyptian Gods  and the anime versions of the " Legendary Dragons ", use 14 colors, and  Spell  and  Trap  Cards use one color each. In addition, the card's name is also colored: most categories of cards use black text, but white text is used on Dark Synchro,  Xyz  (including Xyz  Pendulum Monsters ), and  Link  Monsters and on Spell and Trap Cards, to ensure enough contrast for the name to be readable.
 Cards in the  manga series  have black text on a white frame, regardless of the card's category; this is true even for cards shown on the covers of volumes or in full-color pages.
 Older video games usually do not distinguish  Ritual Monsters  from  Normal  or  Effect  Monsters, but do distinguish  Ritual Cards  from other Spell Cards, giving them the blue frame color used elsewhere for the monsters themselves.

 Notes 
 
 ↑  1.0   1.1   1.2   Only the non-legal version. 
 
 ↑   Effect Monsters that are also another monster type (for example, Synchro/Effect) use the color of the other type instead of the Effect Monster color. 
 
 ↑   Pendulum Monsters, because they are effectively a combination of another monster type and a Spell Card, use a vertical gradient that fades from the other monster type's card color to the green color used for Spell Cards. 
 
 ↑  4.0   4.1   Only in the anime. 
 
 ↑   Only in certain video games.
