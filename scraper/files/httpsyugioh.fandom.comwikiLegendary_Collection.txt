 Legendary Collection  is a  TCG  collector's set, and the first set in the  Legendary Collection  series. It contains an  Egyptian God  ring binder, six promotional cards and a number of  Booster Packs . It has been released in English, German and Italian.
 The promotional cards include the original versions of the Egyptian Gods; " Obelisk the Tormentor ", " Slifer the Sky Dragon " and " The Winged Dragon of Ra ", and the signature cards of  Seto Kaiba ,  Yugi Muto  and  Joey Wheeler ; " Blue-Eyes White Dragon ", " Dark Magician " and " Red-Eyes Black Dragon ".
 The North and Latin American version of the set contains one of each of the following Booster Packs, without -EN in their Set Numbers:
 
 Legend of Blue Eyes White Dragon 
 Metal Raiders 
 Spell Ruler 
 Pharaoh's Servant 
 Dark Crisis 
 Invasion of Chaos 
 The European and Oceanic version of the set contains two of each of the following Booster Packs.
 
 Legend of Blue Eyes White Dragon 
 Metal Raiders 
 Pharaoh's Servant 
 The reason why six specific packs were chosen for the North and Latin American version of this product is because they were "the 6 best-selling packs from the classic era," as quoted by  Kevin Tewart  in  one of his posts  on Pojo.
 This collection was later reprinted in a box more similar to later releases in the Legendary Collection series as  Legendary Collection: Gameboard Edition .
