 Link Summoning  this card with the listed Types ( Dragon ,  Dinosaur ,  Sea Serpent  and  Wyrm ) allows it to apply all of its effects in sequence. They do not have to be exactly one monster each from the  Main Deck  with those types, because you can Link climb into this card using  Link Monsters  of those types as well.
 " Reprodocus " (Dinosaur) can be Link Summoned with any two monsters, and " Berserker of the Tenyi " (Wyrm) can be Link Summoned using "Reprodocus" as material, thus, by opening with " Unexpected Dai " and " Deep Sea Diva ", you can set up the Link climb by doing the following: 
 Use "Unexpected Dai" to summon " Guardragon Justicia " (Dragon). 
 Link Summon " Imduk the World Chalice Dragon " using "Justicia". 
 Normal Summon "Deep Sea Diva" and use its effect to Special Summon " Deep Sea Artisan " (both Sea Serpent) from your Deck, whose effect revives "Justicia". You now have the four monsters to Link climb into this card. 
 " Slash Draw " can be used to mill your Deck before summoning this card. Its  Limited  status means one won't risk destroying their own cards for setting up "Agave Dragon’s" Link Summon. Additionally, "Slash Draw’s" second Effect allows you to return necessary cards from your Graveyard to your Deck, including cards that might have been accidentally sent there in the first place that can be Special Summoned from the Deck (I.e. " Hydrogeddon "). 
 Use " Rebirth Judgment " for greater effectiveness of one of this card's effects upon Link Summon while only being able to use that effect.
