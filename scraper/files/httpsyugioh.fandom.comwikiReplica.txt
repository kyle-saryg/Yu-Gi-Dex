Replica  is a term in the  TCG  and  OCG  that is printed on  reprints  of tournament promotional or prize cards. While used on many cards in the  OCG , in the  TCG  it is exclusively used in  World Superstars .
 This was an early attempt to track the value of cards for Duelists in the  OCG , as "replica" cards would be worth less compared to  Original Print  cards that were originally only obtainable by participating in or even winning an official tournament.
 
 Usage 
 In the Japanese and Asian-English  OCG , replica is used on reprints of cards that were originally printed as  invitation ,  attendance ,  participation , or  prize cards  for the  Yu-Gi-Oh! Duel Monsters II: Dark duel Stories Duelist Legend in Tokyo Dome  tournament; for reprints of the  Yu-Gi-Oh! Duel Monsters III: Tri-Holy God Advent Official Tournament Street Duel Legend of Power  prize card ; for all prints of  Match winners  (except " Victory Dragon "); for all reprints of the original  Egyptian God  Cards; for the  Ritual Monster  counterparts of the  Yu-Gi-Oh! Duel Monsters National Tournament  prize cards ; and (seemingly mistakenly due to being included in  Premium Pack 3 ) all reprints of " Meteor Dragon " and " Black Magic Ritual ".
 In addition to their original print, reprints in the  Asia Championship 2001 ,  Structure Deck: Yugi , the  Anniversary Pack , the  Yu-Gi-Oh! The Dark Side of Dimensions Duel Set , and  Structure Deck: Yugi Muto  are not marked as replicas. All Japanese and Asian-English prints of Match winners (except "Victory Dragon") and the Ritual Monster counterparts of the  Yu-Gi-Oh! Duel Monsters National Tournament  prize cards use replica, including the original  OCG  prints. Additionally, replica reprints of the original  Yu-Gi-Oh! Duel Monsters National Tournament  prize cards were released through some unknown means.
 In the Korean  OCG , prior to the release of  Millennium Deck , replica was exclusively used on  Match winners  (except " Victory Dragon "). From  Millennium Deck  onward, replica is printed on Korean cards that are also printed as replicas in the Japanese  OCG .
 In the  TCG , it is exclusively used on the  Match winners  printed in  World Superstars .
 
 Card layout 
 In the Japanese  OCG , replica is formatted "Replica" on cards that are not Match winners. In all other language releases as well as Japanese Match winners, replica is formatted "REPLICA".
 On cards that do not have  limitation text  and are not  Pendulum Monsters , replica is placed in the bottom left corner in lieu of the  passcode  (the cards simply lack a passcode altogether). 
 For Match winners that are not Pendulum Monsters, due to having  limitation text , instead of being printed in the bottom left corner in lieu of the passcode, it is instead printed on the left side of the card between the artwork and lore box, where Edition text like " Limited Edition " is printed in the  TCG  prior to  Series 9 .
 For Match winners that are Pendulum Monsters, due to having  limitation text  and no room between the artwork and lore box, REPLICA is placed to the right of the  Card Number . If a Match winner Pendulum Monster would have edition text and is a replica, the Edition text is simply omitted (even if the other cards in the same set are not  Unlimited Edition ).
 In the  TCG  and Korean  OCG , if a replica non-Pendulum Monster also has edition text, REPLICA is slashed with the edition text, with REPLICA being listed first.
