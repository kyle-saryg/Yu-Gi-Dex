 Summary 
 Nash 's body glows with purple energy and he thanks  Yuma  and  Astral , calling them his best friends. He admits that their  Duel  was the greatest Duel he'd ever played until the final second - and the greatest Duel he'd ever enjoyed. The " Numbers " fly from his chest and are absorbed by Astral. Tears in his eyes, Yuma calls out "Shark!", but Nash only fades away. Yuma screams out in anguish, but they find themselves back in  Heartland , at the spot where  Mr. Heartland  was defeated.  Vetrix  and  Kazuma  reappear in the merged worlds and Vetrix remarks that the worlds are drifting apart now (in the dub, Vetrix remarks that Yuma saved the day). Kazuma agrees, watching the  Astral World  drift off and stating that the three worlds have been saved. He seems concerned about his son though. Nevertheless, he thanks Vetrix for his help, calling him "old friend". Vetrix muses that with this, he's paid back a bit of the debt he owed (in the dub, Vetrix comments that pushing two planets back must have been hard work). Kazuma mutters his name, but Vetrix simply says "farewell, Kazuma" and fades away. Kazuma thanks him once more.
 
       Yuma  celebrates  Flip 's return.     
 Yuma is on his knees, still sobbing. Astral simply stares, worried. Behind  Tori , a blob of light appears and from it emerges  Flip . He mutters "ura" several times, then wonders what's happened (in the dub, Flip mutters that he does not want to Duel a monkey). He sees Yuma and Tori and smiles. Tori calls out his name. All around the city, the defeated Duelists reappear in the same spots they were defeated at -  Bronk ,  Anna ,  Nelson ,  Roku ,  Kaze ,  Dextra  and  Nistro  appear first. Astral muses that Shark's death has severed the fusion between  Earth  and the  Barian World , returning the stolen souls. Seconds after,  Quattro  reappears seeing he's made it wondering if Shark did then so do  Trey  and  Quinton . Quinton remarks that Yuma must have pulled through, then. Yuma calls out Flip's name, while Flip sobs that it's all thanks to Yuma. Yuma wonders if everyone is back, then.  Hart ,  Lillybot ,  Caswell  and  Cathy  run towards him from one direction, while Bronk comes from another. Overhead, Anna and Nelson appear riding Anna's cannon. Each of them calls out Yuma's name in turn and he yells back "everyone!"
 
       Numeron Dragon  speeds towards the  Sphere Field .     
 Yuma is ecstatic that everyone is safe. Bronk warmly remarks that it's just like Yuma to come through like that. Anna says she believed in him the whole time (in the dub, Anna congratulates Yuma for defeating the Barians). Yuma tells them that they deserve credit too. Hart calls out to him and asks if they won. Yuma closes his eyes, his expression pained. Hart mutters his name, while Yuma finally says " he  isn't alive, Hart." He says that in the end, he couldn't save everyone and thinks of Kite, Shark and  Rio  (Kite's death isn't mentioned in the dub though implied). He wonders what the point of Dueling was if he couldn't save them all (In the dub he thinks dueling made this chaos happen). Tori mutters Poor Yuma and cries. Astral floats up into the air and begin glowing an even lighter shade of blue. The "Numbers" fly out from him and form a blue  Sphere Field  above their heads. The others vanish and around Yuma and Astral the planets of the solar system come into view. The  Numeron Dragon  bursts up from the ground roaring and flies at the Sphere Field. Astral tells Yuma that the one hundred "Numbers" they gathered are all present now. After the energy from the dragon hitting the sphere fades, the  Numeron Code  floats before them.
 
       The  Numeron Code  appears.     
 Astral calls it the card that has written the history of both the past and future. Astral muses that his final mission is upon them - he must use the Numeron Code to rewrite the whole of history. Yuma asks what he means and Astral replies that the Barian World still exists. Yuma is incredulous, unable to believe Astral would do this. Astral claims he must annihilate the Barian World. Yuma asks if he's serious and Astral tells him that the Barian World is the root of all  Chaos  - it cannot be left as it is. Yuma asks if the Astral World has changed yet. He says there is no point to the future if they have to keep sacrificing things. He wonders if Astral learned anything from all this - if they keep fighting, they can figure out a better way. Yuma wonders if Astral would really give up this easily. Astral replies that his answer will not change. Yuma claims he'll never let Astral do something like that. Astral asks what Yuma plans to do, then. He replies that he'll Duel him. Astral wonders if he means to wager the future that the Code will write on the Duel. Yuma confirms this, but Astral reminds him that he possesses each and every last "Number". He claims no one in the universe can defeat him now. He wonders how Yuma can still intend to fight. Yuma demands that if he wins, he'll listen to Yuma. Astral agrees, but tells him that if he wins, he'll destroy the Barian World and delete every last memory of Astral from Yuma's mind. Yuma still agrees, so Astral tells him they'll fight tonight at the station square. Astral vanishes into the  Emperor's Key  and the planets fade, with Yuma finding himself back with his friends.
 
         Kazuma  confronts  Astral .     
 Bronk asks Yuma what's happened, while Cathy wonders where Astral has gone. Flip and Tori echo these concerns. Later, Yuma sits at  home , working on his Deck. He believes this Deck will be able to beat Astral and remarks that it will be their first and final Duel (in the dub, Yuma also doubts himself if he can beat Astral; the two of them fought together as friends and now they will have to face each other). He glances back at the Emperor's Key, hung on the wall. He muses that there's still things Astral doesn't understand about him and vice-versa. Within the key, Astral stands on top of the  Different Dimension Airship . Kazuma appears behind him, saying he sent Astral to take care of Yuma - and they exceeded his expectations (in the dub, Kazuma tries to cheer up Astral; this isn't the look of someone who saved the galaxy. He also thanks Astral for what he had done for Yuma). Astral tells him he isn't done yet - he still has the duty to use the Numeron Code (in the dub, Astral confesses that he forced Yuma into a Duel he did not want to do). Kazuma calls that conflict "the future of you kids" and says he won't intervene. Astral asks if everything went according to his plan. Kazuma replies that he's not so sure (in the dub, Astral asks Kazuma if he did not care if Astral broke Yuma's heart; Kazuma replies with, "maybe, maybe not"). Astral asks if he noticed, then. Kazuma responds with his own question, asking if he'll really fight Yuma. Astral tells him he will - with everything he's got (in the dub, Astral is puzzled by Kazuma's carefree personality, while Kazuma states that the Duel may be about more than just the Barian World). Still staring at the cards he's arranged, Yuma wipes his eyes and tells himself to get a grip. He realizes that Astral will have " Utopia " and all the other "Numbers". He hears a scream and suddenly Anna comes barreling through the wall of his room on her cannon, knocking his father's artifacts off the wall. She apologizes, admitting the brakes on her cannon are pretty bad (in the dub, Anna comments that Yuma wasn't using that wall anyway). Taking the mask that fell onto his face off, Yuma asks what she was thinking. Caswell, Cathy, Flip and Nelson emerge from the window, while Tori and Bronk come in through the ladder.
 
         Yuma's friends offer him their cards.     
 Yuma wonders what they're all doing here. Downstairs,  Kari  remarks at what a mess they've made.  Haru  tells her they'll need more Duel rice and Lillybot calls Yuma an idiot (in the dub, Kari is disappointed that Yuma's friends may have to stay for dinner, while Kari says she made enough seconds and thirds; Lillybot chimes in with "fourths, fifths, and sixths"). Haru says Yuma has made many friends in a short amount of time. Kari wonders if Dueling was really to thank for it. Haru says she thinks so and suggests Kari start Dueling and find herself a husband. Kari seems mortified at first, but admits that might not be too bad (in the dub, Haru suggests that Kari start Dueling to make her own friends to improve her social life). Yuma and his friends now gather on the roof. Yuma informs them he's rather busy building his Deck. Nelson claims he's come with a "lavish banquet" ("cavalcade" in the dub) of cards and holds out his own Deck, " Superdimensional Robot Galaxy Destroyer " visible on the bottom. As he looks around, Yuma sees everyone offering their cards to him - " Antidote Nurse ", " Tin Archduke ", " Flipangutan ", " Superdreadnought Rail Cannon Gustav Max " and " Cat Girl ". Caswell and Bronk tell him that Astral's Deck has all the "Numbers" and Flip thinks that in order to fight it, they'll need to combine their strength. Tori urges him to let them fight Astral together. Nelson says they are all indebted to Astral, while Anna asks which cards Yuma would like to use (Nelson's and Anna's remarks are cut from the dub at this point). Yuma thanks them, but tells them he has to Duel with his own strength. He believes that if he can't fight this Duel by himself, it wouldn't have a point. Tori mutters Yuma's name, but Bronk says he understands - this will be his first and last Duel with Astral (in the dub, Bronk still respects Yuma's decision, but tells him not to run crying if he loses). He urges Yuma and Astral to beat on each other as hard as they can. Yuma agrees, but tells them he will fight with everyone's feelings in mind, finishing with " kattobingu ".
 
         The Duel arena - the station square.     
 Later, Yuma walks with Tori. She remarks that it's odd - Astral was always with them when they've walked this way (in the dub, Tori is excited about the Duel; Yuma will be Dueling against his best friend). Yuma doesn't answer, but eventually comes out of it and tells Tori that she's watched them Duel all this time. He wants to talk to her about something alone before the Duel. Tori mutters his name (in the dub, Yuma makes Tori promise to keep a secret he is about to tell her). A short time later, Yuma and Astral stand at the station square. Astral asks if Yuma's finished his Deck. Yuma replies that it's perfect (in the dub, Astral asks Yuma if he is ready; Yuma replies that he's ready to win). Yuma's friends have all gathered and Nistro and Dextra also arrive. Dextra asks if Yuma and Astral are fighting at last and wonders what Yuma's thinking. Nistro replies that he's probably going to try to hit Astral with everything he has. Anna tells Yuma to do his best, while, Caswell wishes them both good luck (in the dub, Caswell hopes that Astral would win). Flip simply says "ura, ura", while Cathy cheers Astral's name (in the dub, Flip yells, "good luck!" and Cathy encourages Yuma to "show [his] fangs"). Tori thinks to herself that none of them realize the true point of this Duel. Up on the top of a nearby skyscraper, Trey, Quinton and Quattro stand. Quinton says there's a strange gravitational field in the air over the city now and believes that the Numeron Code's appearance has caused it (in the dub, Quinton remarks that they should feel privileged to watch the Duel, but he cannot help but feel uneasy about something concerning it). Trey and Quattro muse that they're Dueling over the Code itself then. Trey calls it the "ultimate card" that can rewrite the past and future. Quinton stares up at the moon and hopes that with the power of the Code, the one soul that has not returned will be able to. He mutters Kite's name. Quattro wonders what Yuma and his friends would intend to do with the Code if Yuma wins. Quinton replies that he's not sure, but that the answer should become clear through the Duel (the conversation about the Numeron Code is cut from the dub). Astral thinks back to his times with Yuma and believes that this day has been coming ever since they met. He tells Yuma that this is their first - and final - Duel. Yuma says he knew they'd eventually have to go their separate ways, but he didn't think it would turn out like this (Astral remembering his times with Yuma is cut from the dub). They agree to begin and Yuma yells "kattobingu!" Yuma activates his  D-Pad  and dons his  Duel Gazer , while Astral's D-Pad materializes on his arm and his yellow eye glows. The two yell "Duel!'
 Yuma says he'll go first and  draws . He  Normal Summons  " Gogogo Golem " and  Sets  three cards to end his  turn . Astral thinks to himself that Yuma has brazenly Summoned "Gogogo Golem" in  Attack Position . Astral draws and then  activates  a  Continuous Spell Card  called " Parallel Unit ". He explains that it will be treated as a  Monster Card  of the same  Level  as a monster his opponent  controls . A spectral "Gogogo Golem" appears on the  field . He then activates another Continuous Spell Card - " Solid Overlay ". He reveals that it can be used as an  Overlay Unit  for the  Xyz Summon  of a  Rank  4 monster. Dextra seems surprised that an  Xyz Summon  has been set up already. Astral overlays his two Level 4 monsters to Xyz Summon "Utopia" in Attack Position. Astral says his battle starts here and that he's entrusting his wishes to the white wings of the "messenger of light".
 
         Astral's  Double Rank-Up Xyz Change .     
 Nelson remarks that Astral is going full force right away. Yuma stares, finding it odd to be fighting against "Utopia". Astral then activates " Double-Rank-Up-Magic Utopia Force ", explaining that it lets him  target  two Overlay Units  attached  to "Utopia" and Special Summon two  Xyz Monsters  whose Ranks are 1 or 2 higher than that of "Utopia" and use those Overlay Units as Units for the new monsters. He declares " Double Rank-Up Xyz Change ". The Overlay Units fly off into two new  Overlay Networks  and Astral Special Summons " Chaos Number 39: Utopia Ray Victory " and " Number 39: Utopia Beyond ". Yuma is shocked to see three forms of "Utopia" so quickly. Astral tells him he is coming at him now and activates the  effect  of "Utopia Beyond", which reduces the  ATK  of his opponent's monsters to 0 during his  Battle Phase . "Utopia Beyond" fires a blue laser, prompting "Gogogo Golem" to fall forward onto its hands as its ATK becomes 0. Bronk says Yuma is in big trouble and Cathy remarks that he'll get "scratched" by the attacks of the three "Utopia" forms (in the dub, Cathy wonders how Yuma will claw himself out of this mess). Yuma activates his  face-down  " Guardraw ", explaining that it lets him change a monster to  Defense Position  and draw a card. Trey is impressed, while Quattro says he'll be able to hold off two attacks this way (in the dub, Trey is the one who makes Quattro's original comment; Quattro praises Yuma for the play). Quinton believes Astral will have a counter.
 
         " Guard Go! " augments Yuma's defenses.     
 Astral orders "Victory" to attack "Gogogo Golem". He activates the effect of "Victory",  detaching  an Overlay Unit to  negate  the effects of his opponent's monsters during  battle  and prevent the activation of  Spell  and  Trap Cards . Astral declares " Rising Sun Double Victory Slash ". "Gogogo Golem" is  destroyed . Yuma activates his face-down " Guard Go! ", revealing that during a turn where a " Gagaga ", " Gogogo " or " Dododo " monster he controls is destroyed, he can use this to revive that monster. "Gogogo Golem" reappears and Yuma specifies that he can then Special Summon up to two "Gagaga", "Gogogo" or "Dododo" monsters from his hand. He Special Summons " Gagaga Magician " and " Dododo Warrior ". Astral admits that Yuma had a better defense prepared than he expected. He orders "Utopia Beyond" to destroy "Gagaga Magician", while having "Utopia" do the same to "Dododo Warrior". Yuma is pleased he managed to avoid damage.
 
         Astral's " Hope " monsters and " Number 25: Force Focus ".     
 Astral asks if he really did and activates a  Quick-Play Spell Card  - " Rank-Up-Magic Dark Force ". Yuma is shocked to see a second " Rank-Up-Magic ". Astral explains that when an Xyz Monster he controls destroys an opponent's monster by battle, this card lets him send that Xyz Monster to the Graveyard to Xyz Summon two Xyz Monsters whose Ranks are 1 and/or 2 Ranks higher, but their effects will be negated. He sends the Rank 4 "Utopia" to the Graveyard to Xyz Summon the Rank 5 " Chaos Number 39: Utopia Ray V " in Attack Position and the Rank 6 " Number 25: Force Focus " in Defense Position. Yuma is surprised, but Astral tells him he's not done yet. He activates another Quick-Play Spell Card - " Grave Chaos ". As an Xyz Monster was sent to the Graveyard, this lets him Special Summon a " C " Xyz Monster with the same Rank with its effects negated. He Special Summons " Chaos Number 39: Utopia Ray ". Finally, Astral activates the effect of "Utopia Beyond", letting him detach an Overlay Unit to  banish  an Xyz Monster he controls to Special Summon "Utopia" from his Graveyard and gain Life Points equal to half its  ATK . He banishes "Force Focus" to Special Summon "Utopia" and increase his Life Points to 5250. Yuma stares at the five "Utopia" forms in awe.
 
         Yuma explains the Duel's true purpose to Tori.     
 Nistro is surprised at what an intense Duel this is already. Dextra wonders what Astral is planning, though. Trey says Yuma is holding on, but Quattro thinks it's a match he really can't win (in the dub, Trey comments that the Duel is unfair on Yuma's end; Quattro calls this an understatement). Nelson muses that this is what Astral is like when he's truly serious, while Anna calls his approach overkill. Cathy makes a cat pun, calling it "purr-tty scary" (in the dub, Cathy wonders what got into Astral). Bronk finally remarks that something is off about Astral. Tori thinks back to what Yuma had told her earlier - Astral will destroy the Barian World if he wins. Yuma tells her not to tell the others about this. She asks why and he replies that it doesn't matter if Astral wins or loses - this Duel has to happen. He wants the others to remember Astral as a good guy when this is all over. In the present, Astral orders "Utopia" to attack "Gogogo Golem". Yuma reminds him that once per turn, "Gogogo Golem" can't be  destroyed by battle  while it's in Defense Position. The attack rebounds off of "Gogogo Golem" and Astral says he was aware of that, but that he still has attacks left. He tells "Utopia Ray" to attack with " Rising Sun Chaos Slash ". "Gogogo Golem" explodes and Astral orders "Utopia Ray V" to attack Yuma  directly  with " Rising Sun Star Slash ". Yuma is thrown back violently and lands face-first in the dirt, his Life Points falling to 1400. Trey and Quattro are surprised Astral is really trying to crush Yuma this way. Bronk asks if this isn't overkill and even Flip thinks this is insane. Tori stares and just mutters Yuma's name.
 
 Featured Duel: Yuma Tsukumo vs. Astral 
         The Final Duel.     
 Turn 1: Yuma 
 Yuma  draws " Gogogo Golem " and subsequently  Normal Summons  it ( 4/1800/1500) in Attack Position. He then  Sets  three cards.
 Turn 2: Astral 
 Astral  draws " Parallel Unit " and subsequently  activates  it to target "Gogogo Golem" and allow himself to treat "Parallel Unit" as a  monster  with the same  Level  as the targeted monster and use "Parallel Unit" for an Xyz Summon. He then activates " Solid Overlay ", which can be treated as an  Overlay Unit  for the  Xyz Summon  of a  Rank  4 monster. Astral  overlays  "Parallel Unit" and "Solid Overlay" in order to Xyz Summon " Number 39: Utopia " ( 4/2500/2000, ORU: 2) in  Attack Position . 
 Astral activates " Double-Rank-Up-Magic Utopia Force " to target "Number 39: Utopia", Special Summon two  Xyz Monsters  from his  Extra Deck  that are one or two Ranks higher than the targeted monster,  detach  both of the Overlay Units from "Utopia" and  attach  one to each of the Summoned monsters. Astral Special Summons " Chaos Number 39: Utopia Ray Victory " ( 5/2800/2500, ORU: 1) and " Number 39: Utopia Beyond " ( 6/3000/2500, ORU: 1), both in Attack Position ("Utopia": 2 → 0 ORU).
 As Astral enters his  Battle Phase , the third effect of "Utopia Beyond" reduces the  ATK  of all monsters Yuma controls to 0 ("Gogogo Golem": 1800 → 0 ATK). Yuma activates his  face-down  " Guardraw " to switch "Gogogo Golem" to  Defense Position  and  draw a card . "Utopia Ray Victory" attacks "Gogogo Golem" and Astral activates the third effect of "Utopia Ray Victory" to detach an Overlay Unit ("Utopia Ray Victory": 1 → 0 ORU), increase the ATK of "Utopia Ray Victory" by the ATK of "Gogogo Golem" ("Utopia Ray Victory" does not gain any ATK here due to the ATK of "Gogogo Golem" being 0) and negate the latter monster's effects. Astral explains that due to the final effect of "Utopia Ray Victory", Yuma can't activate  Spell  and  Trap Cards  until the end of the  Damage Step . "Utopia Ray Victory" then destroys "Gogogo Golem". 
 Yuma activates his face-down " Guard Go! " to let him Special Summon a " Gagaga ", " Dododo ", or " Gogogo " monster that was destroyed and sent to the Graveyard this  turn , along with two of those kinds of monsters from his  hand . Yuma revives "Gogogo Golem" ( 4/1800/1500) in Defense Position and Special Summons " Dododo Warrior " ( 6/2300 → 0/900) and " Gagaga Magician " ( 4/1500 → 0/1000) from his hand both in Defense Position. "Utopia Beyond" attacks and destroys "Gagaga Magician" while "Utopia" attacks and destroys "Dododo Warrior".
 
         The five forms of "Utopia" gather.     
 As an Xyz Monster he controls destroyed a monster  by battle  this turn and sent it to the Graveyard, Astral activates " Rank-Up-Magic Dark Force " to target "Utopia", send it to the Graveyard, and Special Summon an Xyz Monster that is one Rank higher than the targeted monster, as well as Special Summon an Xyz Monster that is two Ranks higher than the targeted monster, but both monsters will have their effects  negated . Astral Special Summons " Chaos Number 39: Utopia Ray V " ( 5/2600/2000) in Attack Position and " Number 25: Force Focus " ( 6/2800/2400) in Defense Position. Astral then activates " Grave Chaos " to target "Utopia" (as it was sent to the Graveyard during this Battle Phase) in order to Special Summon " Chaos Number 39: Utopia Ray " ( 4/2500/2000) in Attack Position with its effects negated (as "Utopia Ray" has the same Rank as "Utopia"). 
 Astral activates the final effect of "Utopia Beyond" to detach an Overlay Unit ("Utopia Beyond": 1 → 0 ORU),  banish  "Force Focus" (an Xyz Monster), revive "Utopia" ( 4/2500/2000) in Attack Position, and gain  Life Points  equal to half its ATK (Astral: 4000 → 5250 LP). "Utopia" attacks "Gogogo Golem", but the effect of "Gogogo Golem" prevents its destruction since it's in Defense Position. "Utopia Ray" attacks and destroys "Gogogo Golem" and "Utopia Ray V" attacks  directly  (Yuma: 4000 → 1400 LP).
 Duel continues in the next episode .
