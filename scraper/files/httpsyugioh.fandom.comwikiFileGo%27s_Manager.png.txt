 Biography 
 Hanoi 
 The manager was first seen in  Gore's warehouse  trying to calm  George Gore  down after he threw his weights in anger of  Playmaker 's rising popularity. In a effort to do so, he encouraged Gore to learn about the new and popular  Speed Duels . When  Akira Zaizen  arrived at the warehouse, he did not recognize him. He then accepted Akira's business card on Gore's behalf and introduced himself to Akira. He then defended Gore's choice of not having a more lavish home when Akira questioned it. As Akira began his offer, the manager recognized Akira's gift as a  D-Board  for Speed Duels and questioned the purpose of such a gift. The manager approved Akira's offer, but asked for Gore's opinion as well. He was surprised when Gore rejected the offer. As Akira left, the manager commented that Akira acted like he knew everything and told Gore that the offer was also a threat. [1] 
 As Gore and Playmaker Dueled, his manager visited  the orphanage , intending to watch the reactions of the children there. He then showed that he didn't mind the children's change of heart as they were honest in supporting the coolest hero. He then agreed with the  owner and primary caregiver  that Gore would regain his popularity among the children if he won. When Gore lost half his  LP  and at the owner's concern, he then told the owner that Gore was fine and pretending to be in a disadvantage to exaggerate his opponent's strength was his style. When Gore  Link Summoned  " Gouki The Great Ogre ", he answered the owner's question that Gore's style entertained his viewers as well as his opponents and believed that Gore is in the lead. [2]  When Gore counterattacked, he agreed with the owner that Gore would win but privately felt there is something amiss with Playmaker. He was pleased when Gore saved his "Great Ogre" from destruction from Playmaker's " Decode Talker ". [3]
