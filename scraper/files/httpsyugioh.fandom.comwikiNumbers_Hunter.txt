 Possessed Duelists 
       Flip's  hands are marked with Numbers after taking control of  Yuma's  Numbers.     
 "Numbers" have the ability to possess people, and do so when they are initially released. Numbers can have varying control over people, from increasing their already present emotions (as in the case with  Flip ) to actually controlling and manipulating their mind (as with  Nelson Andrews ). Some "Number"-possessed wish to gain more "Numbers" ( Number 20's holder ,  Chills , and  Scorch ). Possessed Duelists can usually be seen with glowing purple pupils and a dark glowing aura around their body. " Number 7 " is the only one that does not possess the Duelist and instead gives them luck, which is seen as a rainbow aura, though like all Numbers it intensified Charlie's emotions to fulfill his goal. If a Numbers Holder were to possess the  Emperor's Key , or have used Numbers multiple times, they would become immune to the corrupting effects.

 Number Hunter 
 This article is about the people. For the card, see  Numeral Hunter .      
 A  Number Hunter  ( Ｎｏ． ハンター,  Nanbāzu Hantā ,  Numbers Hunter ) is any individual who collects "Number" cards for one reason or another.  Kite Tenjo [1]  claimed himself to be a Number Hunter, being the only one, but later he designated  Yuma Tsukumo  as a Number Hunter. [2]  Yuma probably does not consider himself a Number Hunter, after observing what  Kite Tenjo  does after he defeats a holder, but he falls into the category, as he and  Astral  both collect "Numbers", and have a motivation for it. Number Hunters have ways of detecting when a Number holder appears, and a method to take away that Number when they defeat it. A Number holder possessed by the card wanting more "Numbers" is not considered a Number Hunter, as their objectives are not their own, but by the "Number's" corruption.
