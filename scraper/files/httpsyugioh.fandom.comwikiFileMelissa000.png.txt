 Appearance 
 Melissa is dressed like a cowgirl. Her outfit consists of a white shirt that shows her midriff along with a yellow bow, a red vest, a cowboy hat, and yellow shorts. She uses a white microphone with a yellow top in her commentaries. Melissa is fair skinned.
 
 Personality 
 Melissa shows enthusiasm and pride in her broadcasting, even acknowledging her own popularity after jumping off her broadcast helicopter to land inside the  Duel Palace  safely with the help of a parachute. [4]   In the dub, she claims to have an allergy to cats. [5]  She does not co-ordinate well with her production team, appearing confused when  Riley Akaba  was replaced at the last minute by  Moon Shadow  with the hologram presented to her still showing Riley's name [6] , and can often be impatient when she does not have the chance to speak, as shown when  Sylvio Sawatari  passes her microphone to  Yuya Sakaki  in order for him to broadcast his intent to duel Jack Atlas. [7] 
 
 Etymology 
 Melissa means "bee" in Greek, and Claire means "clear" in French. Her initials of her translated Japanese name are "MC," which alludes to her jobs as a reporter and announcer. Her dub surname, "Trail", references her job as a reporter, who is required to trail important events and people for news coverage.
 
 Voice/Mannerisms 
 In the dub, Melissa has a Western accent and often uses euphemisms as well as typical Western lingo like y'all.
