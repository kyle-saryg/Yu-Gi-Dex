 Joey Wheeler  and  Weevil Underwood  faced each other in a game of  Duel Monsters , during the  Battle City  arc, in the  Yu-Gi-Oh!  anime . It is based on   Katsuya Jonouchi and Insector Haga's Duel  in the  Yu-Gi-Oh! (manga) .
 
 Prior Events 
 It's the second day of  Seto Kaiba 's Battle City tournament. Joey decides to try and find another duelist to beat. He soon encounters a kid who wanted his autograph. When he asks to see Joey's  Duel Disk , he runs off with it.  Téa Gardner ,  Tristan Taylor  and  Solomon Muto  notice Joey chasing after the kid and Tristan grabs him. The kid explains that a duelist with bug eyes and a head like a blue beetle ran off with his deck. The group can think of only one person matching this description: Weevil Underwood. Joey and his friends vow to find Weevil and get the kid's deck back. Unknown to then, the kid was actually working for Weevil himself, who double backstabs the kid.
 At the hospital,  Serenity Wheeler  hears a gust of wind being blown in. A nurse asks her if she has heard a young boy named  Kenta  come in to her room, as he is scheduled for an x-ray, but he ran off. As the nurse decides to look elsewhere, she tells Kenta, who was hiding under her bed, that it's safe to come out. As thanks to her for not ratting him out, Kenta goes to the battle city duel website to see if her older brother Joey was dueling.
 The gang soon encounter Weevil, who demands he return the kid's deck. When Weevil denies this claim, Joey challenges him to a duel, but Weevil raises the stakes, dueling not only for the rarest cards in each other's decks, but also for two locator cards. Joey accepts the terms as they both have two locator cards each, and Joey declares it would be an honor for him to kick Weevil out of this tournament  Just like Yugi did back at Duelist Kingdom .
 The duel begins.

"Flying Kamakiri #1"  attacks  "Swordsman of Landstar", but Joey  activates  his face-down " Shield & Sword " to switch the ATK and DEF of every  monster  on the  field  ("Flying Kamakiri #1": 1400 → 900/900 → 1400) ("Swordsman of Landstar": 500 → 1200/1200 → 500). "Swordsman of Landstar"  destroys  "Flying Kamakiri #1" (Weevil 4000 → 3700). 
 Since "Flying Kamakiri #1 was  destroyed by battle  and  sent  to the  Graveyard , its  effect  allows Weevil to  Special Summon  " Flying Kamakiri #2 " (1500/800) in Attack Position. On Weevil's End Phase, the effect of "Shield & Sword" expires ("Swordsman of Landstar": 1200 → 500/500 → 1200).
