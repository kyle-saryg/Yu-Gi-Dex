 The Legendary Dragon 
 
 "Princeton!!" , known as  "The Name is Manjoume!!"  in the Japanese version, is the second chapter of the  Yu-Gi-Oh! GX  manga . It was first printed in Japanese in the  V Jump  magazine on January 21, 2006 and in English in the  Shonen Jump  magazine. Both of which were printed in  volume 1  of the  Yu-Gi-Oh! GX  graphic novels afterwards.
 Jaden Yuki  is set to  Duel  the reputed  Obelisk Blue  prodigy  Chazz Princeton  for an extracurricular Duel. However, what Jaden doesn't know is that Chazz also had a card with a  spirit  on it, but has abandoned it.
 
 Summary 
 The opening of the chapter reveals that some  Duel Monsters  cards have spirits in them and that  Jaden Yuki 's " Winged Kuriboh " is one of them, before mentioning that  Chazz Princeton  has another  card  with a  spirit .
 Chazz recalls starting Dueling at an early age with his card. He won many junior championships and enrolled in the Academy, being placed into  Obelisk Blue  upon entry. However, rumors circulated that he had received his placement because of his family's wealth, as  Bastion Misawa , the top scorer on the entrance exam, was only placed into  Ra Yellow . In order to show that he could win with his own strength, Chazz sealed his card in a box and buried it, deciding to fight alone, and vowed that if he ever lost, he would leave.
 In the present, Jaden is set to Duel Chazz in an extracurricular duel. Chazz recalls that he initially did not consider Jaden worthy of his attention, despite his winning against  Dr. Crowler . One day, Jaden approached him, suggesting that he wanted to pit "Winged Kuriboh" against his card, and when Chazz insulted Kuriboh, Jaden defended it as his "partner." Chazz was surprised at Jaden's description of his card, as well as apparently seeing a spirit behind him.
 In the course of the Duel, Chazz decides to prove that fighting alone makes him stronger. Jaden recalls that when he saw Chazz duel in the junior tournaments, he seemed to be having fun, but he now appears to be suffering and dueling in anger. Chazz thinks that Jaden cannot be Duel King if he does not sacrifice anything to do so, and declares that he will become Duel King.
