 Celina , spelled  Serena [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7]  (セレナ  Serena ) in the Japanese version, is a character in the  Yu-Gi-Oh! ARC-V  anime. She is a reincarnation of  Ray Akaba , as well as a  dimensional counterpart  of  Zuzu Boyle  ( Standard Dimension ),  Rin  ( Synchro Dimension ) and  Lulu Obsidian  ( Xyz Dimension ). She is also from  Duel Academy  in the  Fusion Dimension , but despite her origins she was still chosen as one of the  Lancers . According to  Leo Akaba , Celina is crucial to his plans. [8] 
 Celina initially expressed a desire to prove herself to the Professor, but had a change of heart when Zuzu told her about Duel Academy's true motives. [9]  Celina was recruited into the Lancers, despite not actually taking part in the  Battle Royal . [10]  After an adventure with them in the  Synchro Dimension , she was recaptured by  Barrett  and sent back to Duel Academy, and placed under  control . [11]  When Celina reunited with some of  her teammates  in the Fusion Dimension, she betrayed them shortly afterward by capturing Zuzu for Duel Academy [12] , due to being under the mind control of  The Doktor , later being freed after he was sealed into a card by Leo Akaba. 
 As consequence of Leo's action, Celina's physical body perished when she rejoined to form  Ray Akaba . However, her spirit ultimately survives and lives on in  Zuzu Boyle .

 Appearance 
   Celina, as a Duel Academy student.   Celina, as a Lancer. 1/2 
 Celina has indigo hair tied into a ponytail with a large yellow ribbon, and green eyes. Her face is the same as  Zuzu 's. Her hair also features two light blue bangs that fall to either side of her face, similar to Zuzu. The colors themselves appear to be in reference to " Polymerization ". The first outfit she wears consists of the  Fusion Dimension 's version of the  Slifer Red  jacket, with a yellow stripe and a green-and-yellow star emblem on each sleeve, which is worn over a black shirt with a purple-brown collar. She also wears a red skirt held up by a brown belt with a silver buckle and ring connecting to two straps going over her torso while her thighs are covered by biker shorts and she wears all brown boots. In addition, like  her counterparts , she wears a  mysterious bracelet . She later switches clothes with Zuzu, but she retains her bracelet, hair ribbon, and Duel Disk. During the second season, Celina changes clothes again and returns Zuzu's clothes to  Yuya , this time wearing a more casual outfit resembling her Academy uniform, composed of a simple red jacket, a broad grey skirt, a black vest that is half unzipped over a white shirt and large black and red boots. She also wears a Turbo Dueling outfit during the  Friendship Cup , a form-fitting maroon jumpsuit with white, and light red markings and purple joint-pads, in addition to purple gloves and a purple helmet with a blue visor.
 In her youth, Celina wore a magenta short-sleeved shirt with purple lining and pointed shoulders over a peach shirt with three yellow stars in the middle and a white collar, white shorts with black shorts underneath and white boots with peach soles, magenta toes and yellow stars on the toes.
 
 Personality 
 As she has been trained largely in  Duel Monsters  and confined in  Duel Academy  castle since her childhood, Celina is serious-minded, but has no social skills as a result, not seeing what was wrong with changing her clothes in front of Moon Shadow and not understanding that not everyone is a  Duelist . When first introduced, she is constantly trying to prove herself worthy to  Leo Akaba  and wants to fight Duel Academy's enemies, and even members of Duel Academy when necessary. Celina is strong-willed and determined to prove her strength to the point that she is willing to put herself in danger to do so. Ironically, while desiring respect, she is very rude when addressing other people as she believes herself to be superior to them. After hearing about  Xyz Dimension  rebels in the  Standard Dimension , Celina heads to capture them. However, unknowing of that dimension having its own  Xyz  users, she started a bigoted hunt for anyone who used them. This lead to her attacking  Dipper O'rion , similar to how  Shay  would randomly attack any  LID  students and teachers prior to cooperating with  Declan Akaba , simply to prove her self-worth with little regard in how her actions affect others.
 Because of her obsession with demonstrating her skills, she takes her Duels seriously and seeks to fight the strongest Duelists she can find and is frustrated and disappointed when she defeats "worthless opponents". She is also proud and short-tempered as seen when  Dennis   Set  a monster and a  Spell / Trap Card , taking it as a provocation to her skills, all the while ignoring his reasons (namely a bad  draw ) as excuses. During her Duel with Yugo, she stated she believes only a well-honed strategy works, which Yugo called 'too by the book'. [6]  Even after her induction into the  Lancers  this desire persisted, partially due to their mission being to find strong allies. Celina's attitude regarding her Dueling changes during her Duel with Yugo; previously she had never found Dueling to be fun, but she enjoyed her Duel with Yugo and she even happily used one of Yuya's entertainment catchphrases.
 Although she is proud to serve Duel Academy and initially believed that what they are doing is right, she was shocked to learn the truth from Shay about how immoral Duel Academy was when they invaded the  Xyz Dimension , attacking defenseless citizens and laughing in joy at their suffering, treating it all as a simple game. Like most students of Duel Academy, Celina is prideful and arrogant, refusing to back down from any challenges she came across. She refused to run away from the  Synchro Dimension 's  Sector Security , though they outnumbered the Lancers. 
 Celina's pride is also her downfall, which leads to her being impatient and reckless. She left the Fusion Dimension with  Barrett  in order to prove herself to Leo. [13]  In the Synchro Dimension, Celina ignored Yuya's warnings about Sector Security twice, once when they arrived and were cornered by Sector Security officers, [3]  and again when she left  Crow 's hideout to recruit more Lancers and search for  Zuzu . [14]  In both cases, these led to dire consequences for her, which were being hunted down by the  Obelisk Force  and getting arrested, respectively. However, Celina is willing to accept responsibility for her actions, seen when she expressed remorse about Zuzu's disappearance. [15]  Ironically, she tends to Duel strategically and consistently, rather than recklessly using different strategies. [6]  She also appears to have honor in her Dueling, refusing to pick up an  Action Card  upon suspecting it was a clear set-up. [7] 
 When she is under the influence of the  Parasite Monster , her personality becomes very similar to  Yuri ; she enjoys taunting others in a playful arrogant manner similar to him, as seen during her Duel with Yuya/Yuto.
 
 Etymology 
 Celina's Japanese name is a common American and Greek name derived from the Greek  Selene  referring to the  Goddess of the Moon  in  Greek mythology . This is fitting given that she uses a Deck themed around the  Moon . In addition her Deck may also be a reference to the Roman moon and wild animal goddess  Diana , given the animal theme of the archetype. She has also been referred to as "Serena" (possibly due to the  "L"/"R" confusion  that is common in Japanese-English translations), which comes from the Latin  serēnus , meaning "clear, tranquil, or serene". It can also be derived of  Mare Serenitatis  ("Sea of Serenity"), which is a  lunar mare  located to the east of  Mare Imbrium  on the Moon. 
 Her dub name, Celina, means sky or heaven, which is a spelling variation of her Japanese name. It is also possible that she is named after the singer  Céline Dion  like her counterpart Zuzu. This is much more direct in the French dub as her name is Céline.
 
 Voice/Mannerisms 
 In both versions, Celina speaks with voice similar to Zuzu Boyle, but with notably rough and tomboyish tone.
 
 Biography 
 History 
       Celina's memories being scanned.     
 When Celina first met the Professor, her memories were scanned for any traces of  Ray ’s memories due to the resemblance and  bracelet , but the Professor found nothing. [16] 
 One day, she and  the Professor  met  Yuri  and told him of his crucial role in the  Arc Project . [17] 
 
       Young Celina.     
 Celina had never been outside  Duel Academy , and thus she didn't know much about the outside world. Three years ago, Celina attempted to escape the island and was chased through the halls of the school by several professors, who eventually corned her. She Dueled against them in a  Battle Royal , but just when she was about to get cornered,  Declan Akaba  who was observing the Duel from the top of the wall behind her, Summoned " D/D Cerberus " to protect her. She then took the hand he offered her, and he pulled her up over the wall. They fled to the harbor, where she realized that he wasn't from Duel Academy, and asked how he was able to get there without a boat. She said she wanted to leave to grasp her future, but then  Leo Akaba  appeared with several  Obelisk Force  members and told her that her future was there. She asked why Leo was keeping her trapped at Duel Academy despite understanding her abilities, to which he merely responded that the time was not right to use them. [18] 
 
       The Professor  seizes Celina.     
 She argued that now should be the time to add her to the vanguard squad, as the  invasion  of the  Xyz Dimension  was about to start. The  Obelisk Force  squad then grabbed her by the arms, and Leo told her that he would definitely find her and bring her back, no matter where she would run. The Obelisk Force carried Celina away as she struggled to free herself. [18] 
 
 Arc League Championship 
         Celina overhearing  Sora 's tantrums     
 After  Sora Perse 's return to the  Fusion Dimension , Celina eavesdropped his ranting as he was undergoing examinations. She overheard his demands to be let back into the  Standard Dimension , as there were remnants of the  Xyz Dimension   forces  and smiled, [19]  having found an opportunity to impress Leo. [18]  In the corridor, Celina told  Barrett  she would go to Standard even if he tried to stop her. Barrett replied that he wanted to go with Celina instead of trying to stop her, to which Celina commented that he was the first guard who didn't try to bring her back. [13]  They went to  Paradise City  and watched  Dipper  win his first-round  Arc League Championship  Duel on a giant screen by the roadside. She was noticed by  Allie  at that point, who was passing by that place and mistook her for  Zuzu Boyle . [19] 
 
         Celina as seen under her hood.     
 Soon after that, she cornered Dipper in an alley and sealed him in a  card . Her next target was  Kev Ravenwood , whom she had learned was an  Xyz  user after watching his Duel. She found him in a hallway at Paradise Stadium and proceeded to challenge him, but his appearance was a ruse by  Declan Akaba , who immediately appeared and warned Kev to leave. Celina tried to chase after him, but Declan held her off by grabbing her arm. Celina threatened to take Declan out first for getting in her way, until Barrett challenged Declan instead. Celina watched the Duel from the sidelines; after Barrett lost, she turned to leave, until Declan called her by name and told her to wait. [13] 
 He commented that she wasn't Zuzu Boyle, and Celina asked who Zuzu was. Declan explained that Zuzu was someone from Standard that resembled Celina and introduced himself, asking her if she remembered him and if she had been sent by Leo Akaba as a vanguard for an invasion. Celina denied working with Leo, having come to Standard of her own free will, and she admitted that she remembered Declan too, as she'd been trapped in that castle since Declan's appearance in her world. Declan explained that he was opposing Leo and offered an alliance, but Celina refused, explaining that she was after the Xyz users in Standard under the belief that defeating them would make Leo Akaba acknowledge her abilities. She gave Declan the card containing Dipper, calling him a disappointment. Declan informed her that neither Dipper nor Yuu were her target, though he claimed to not know  the Duelist  from the Xyz Dimension who had defeated Sora. Declan warned Celina that he would be considering her an enemy even if she wasn't working with Leo and would take appropriate action. Barrett, overhearing this, activated the forced return function of his  Duel Disk , returning to the Fusion Dimension, but alerting them to Celina's location. Celina explained that there would be people from Duel Academy coming after her, which would cause more than just a disturbance, but claimed that once she'd defeated them and the Duelist from the Xyz Dimension, Leo would have no choice but to acknowledge her abilities before departing. The next day, she waited outside the stadium where the Top 16 of the Junior Arc League Championship were, knowing that the Xyz Duelist had to be in there. [18] 
 
         Sun Shadow  saves Celina.     
 While she was in the Jungle Area, Celina saw  Dennis McField  using an  Xyz Monster  during a Duel on a TV screen and headed to the Volcano Area, just missing seeing another Xyz user,  Shay Obsidian , who, unbeknownst to her, was her real target. [20]  She arrived in the Volcano Area where Dennis had just defeated Zuzu Boyle, the girl Declan had told her about. [21]  Celina ignored Zuzu, who thought Celina was another girl,  Lulu , and immediately challenged Dennis, accusing him of being a remnant of the Xyz Dimension. Zuzu tried to protest that they were in the middle of a tournament, but Dennis accepted the challenge. Celina  Fusion Summoned  " Lunalight Cat Dancer " on her first  turn , but rather than  Xyz Summon , Dennis played defensively. Celina was furious at his continued denial of being an Xyz remnant and his defensive play and she dealt massive damage to him on her next turn. Dennis claimed that he was going to get serious, but upon apparently getting a bad draw he desperately  Set  a monster and a card. Thinking that Dennis was underestimating her, Celina prepared to end the Duel. Dennis was about to counter, but he was distracted and defeated by Celina's attack. Six  Obelisk Force  members arrived and advanced on Celina and Zuzu, but the girls were saved by the Senior Lancers arrival and evacuated from the area by  Sun Shadow  and  Moon Shadow . [1] 
 
         Celina using her likeness to  Zuzu  as a disguise to approach  Shay .     
 They ended up in the Iceberg area, where Celina brashly claimed that she didn't need the assistance. Zuzu again asked Celina if she was Lulu, however Celina denied it and she introduced herself to Zuzu. She explained why the Obelisk Force were after her and why she'd come to the Standard Dimension, stating that she was hunting the Xyz remnant. Zuzu claimed that Duel Academy's members had sadistically hunted the people of the Xyz Dimension, an accusation that Celina denied, as she believed Duel Academy's Duelists to be honorable warriors. As she claimed that the Xyz Duelists should have had pride even if they lost, Zuzu angrily pointed out that the Duelists' families were also being affected. She explained the history of  Yuto , Lulu and Shay to Celina and clarified that it was Shay that Celina was after, suggesting that Celina confirm what Zuzu had told her with him. Celina agreed, and Zuzu offered to switch clothes with Celina to act as a decoy for Duel Academy though Zuzu had to remind Celina to hide behind a rock so that Moon Shadow wouldn't see them. After the switch, Zuzu and Celina narrowed down Shay's probable location to the Ancient Ruins area and the two parted ways. [9] 
 
         Celina saves Shay.     
 Celina arrived at the area just in time to see Shay defeated by Sora, and she reacted in horror to Shay's brutal defeat. [22]  Running to Shay and noting his horrible injuries, Celina saved him from Sora with " Lunar Eclipse ," and she and Shay escaped to the Volcano Area, but with Sora hot on their tail and knowing who Celina was. Shay's injuries allowed Sora to catch up to them, though Sun Shadow challenged Sora to a Duel and Moon Shadow guided them away. Three Obelisk Force members approached them and requested that Celina return with them. Celina refused and entered a Duel with them with Shay and Moon Shadow, the latter of whom protected them from the Obelisk Force's attacks. Celina took the next turn, attempting to counterattack with "Lunalight Cat Dancer", but her Deck was well known to the Obelisk Force and they countered with " Fusion Dispersal ". Celina witnessed the arrival and subsequent defeat and sealing of  Reed Pepper  and  Trout  and  Sylvio 's rescue of Moon. [23]  With the combined effort of Sylvio,  Gong  and Shay, they were able to defeat the Obelisk Force. Afterwards, she went to Sora and  Yuya 's Duel, where it ended without a result as the Battle Royal timer had run out. After  Aura  mistook her as Zuzu after Gong had made the initial mistake in the Duel, she clarified that she was not Zuzu, leading Sora to escape when Yuya suspected that Zuzu had also been turned into card. Declan then showed up and informed the group that they passed the Battle Royal Test of becoming  Lancers . [10] 
 
 Friendship Cup 
 When Yuya blamed Declan for what happened, Celina said that if anyone was to blamed for Zuzu's disappearance, it should be her. Celina revealed that she was a Duel Academy Duelist, earning her suspicion from Sylvio who accused her as a spy, but she further revealed that the reason for the Obelisk Force's arrival was to take her back to Duel Academy and assumed that they mistook Zuzu as her. She explained that she swapped clothes with Zuzu so she could meet  Shay  while Zuzu used herself as bait to turn the Obelisk Force's attention away from Celina, much to Yuya's dismay. As Declan and Yuya's Duel started, she began a conversation with Shay to confirm Zuzu's story behind the  Xyz Dimension  tragedy, also revealing to Shay why she had come to  Standard . Shay confirmed the story and told Celina the horrors done to the Xyz Dimension, the effects that it had on him, and  Lulu 's abduction, which visibly shook Celina as she had believed that her comrades fought with pride and honor. She was further shocked when Shay wondered why she also resembled his sister, Lulu. [24] 
 After Declan defeated Yuya, she was present at the stadium along with the other  Battle Royal  survivors when  Henrietta Akaba  announced the cancellation of the  Arc League Championship  and the existence of  Fusion Dimension  to the world. Celina returned Zuzu's clothes to Yuya, promising that if Zuzu was indeed taken by Duel Academy, she would assist in saving her as one of the  Lancers , since she was partly responsible for what happened to Zuzu. [15] 
 The next day, Celina was present for the Lancers meeting. After Declan announced that they were going to the  Synchro Dimension  instead of the Fusion Dimension, Celina convinced Shay that it would be impossible for him to fight Duel Academy all by himself since the students were trained in endurance, and also noted that Declan believed that Zuzu was in the Synchro Dimension. She also agreed with Declan's plan to form an alliance with the Synchro Dimension. After that, Celina and the other Lancers were given upgraded  Duel Disks  with the ability to summon Action Field. With the use of " Dimensionizer ", they were teleported to the Synchro Dimension. [25] 
 
         Celina arriving in the  Synchro Dimension  with Yuya, Sylvio, and Riley.     
 After arriving in the Synchro Dimension, Celina ended up with  Riley Akaba , Sylvio, and Yuya.  Sector Security  showed up and blocked off all exits. They placed Yuya and Celina under arrest. Yuya tried to explain that they just got to  New Domino City , but Sylvio and Celina jumped right into the Duel that Sector Security forced them into, with the former activating the " Crossover " Action Field Spell. [3]  After noticing Yuya's Duel and seeing her opponent use the same cards as well, Celina concluded that Sector Security were using mass-produced Decks. On her next  turn , Celina used her " Lunalight Cat Dancer " and " Lunalight Blue Cat " combo to win against the officer she was Dueling. However, as the " Gate Blockers " were removed, more Sector Security officers arrived to apprehend them. Even after the insistence of Yuya to retreat with Riley, Celina still insisted on fighting all of the officers. Just as they were being cornered by Sector Security,  a Synchro Dimension native   Synchro Summoned  his " Assault Blackwing - Raikiri the Sudden Shower " to create the perfect cover for him and his crew to grab the Lancers and escape. [26]  The Synchro user,  Crow , invited them to stay at his place until things quietened down. Two of the orphans that Crow took care of,  Frankie  and  Tarren  returned with stolen food, and they asked Yuya and Celina why they'd seen them at a café earlier. Celina and Yuya realized that the boys had seen Zuzu and  Yugo , and Crow offered to go and look for them. [27]  Despite this, Celina remained frustrated at the lack of progress, especially when Crow returned without news, as Sector Security were all over the area. Accusing him of coming home with his tail between his legs and concluding that Crow's assistance was all for naught if there were no results, Celina headed out to find news herself, accompanied by Sylvio, ignoring Yuya and Crow's protests. [14] 
 
         Celina gets arrested by  Sector Security .     
 She defeated eight Duelists, seeking strong opponents, and asked the eighth who the strongest Duelist was. The boy replied that the strongest Duelist was  Jack Atlas , a man on posters throughout the City. Sylvio took note of them and asked Celina if she was really looking for Zuzu, given that all she seemed to be doing was Dueling. Celina replied that she was, but she was also fulfilling the Lancers' mission to find strong Duelists. They returned to Crow's hideout to see him Dueling Yuya, but they had unwittingly led Sector Security there and were arrested, with Celina witnessing Moon Shadow rescuing Riley. [4] 
 Celina was put in "special confinement" in the  Facility  by  Jean-Michel Roget , who was intrigued by Celina's  Fusion Summoning  strategies. [28]  After Jean asked his worker on how Celina was doing in her room, the man said that Celina resisted but later calmed down. Jean decided to pay Celina a visit. [29]  Celina was sulking in her room when Dennis arrived to break her out. [30]  When she and her allies attempted to escape the Facility, they were re-arrested by Jean. They were taken to the  High Council  and after Declan suggested that the Lancers take part in  Friendship Cup , she agreed to the proposal. [31]  Celina later Dueled  Tony Zomboni  in the last Duel of the first day of the Friendship Cup. She Summoned her " Lunalight Panther Dancer " to defeat him. [5] 
 Celina watched the Duel between Dennis and Shay and was surprised when Dennis Summoned " Chaos Ancient Gear Giant ". [32]  After learning that Dennis was from Duel Academy, she suspected that he joined the Lancers to keep an eye on her. [33] 
 
 Friendship Cup Finals 
 Celina watched the Duel between Zuzu and  Sergey Volkov , and she expressed confusion at Sergey's Dueling style and pride at Zuzu's Dueling. She was horrified when Sergey brutally defeated Zuzu, which caused her to blast through a building. [34]  She watched Yuya's Turbo Duel against Shinji and noticed that Yuya wasn't concentrating because of what happened to Zuzu. [35]  She was then surprised to see Yuya developed a  Pendulum - Synchro Summon  with " Enlightenment Paladin " which led him to win against Shinji. [36] 
 After Crow and Shay's Duel, she and Yugo were the last two remaining to Duel in the quarterfinals. [37]  When she arrived, she commented on how Yugo was staring vacantly into the sun, calling it insulting to her as his opponent, only to nearly be smothered by Yugo who mistook her for  Rin . Yugo then persistently tried to hug "Rin", only for Celina to punch or kick him after each attempt, until  Melissa Trail  had to start the Duel. Although she took an early lead in the starting sprint due to Yugo's antics, Yugo shot ahead when she reminded him of Rin again by complementing him for his Duel with  Sylvio . When Yugo only summoned a relatively weak monster, " Speedroid Den-Den Daiko Duke ", on his first turn, she berated him for his thoughtless style, only for Yugo to call her too "by the book" when she declared she would end the match on her next turn. She was continually advantaged by Jean during the Duel, who changed the Duel Lanes to make it easier for her to find an Action Card and more difficult for Yugo to do so, as Roget wanted her to win. Yugo managed to prove his luck with " Re-dyce-cle ", bringing out " Clear Wing Synchro Dragon ". [6] 
 
         Celina ignoring the  Action Card  provided by  Roget 's interference.     
 Celina attacked "Clear Wing" with " Lunalight Panther Dancer ", only to be countered by " Dicetadium of Fate ", another one of Yugo's luck-based cards. She managed to save her monster with " Miracle ". When Roget changed the Duel lanes again so Celina could pick up another Action Card, she decided to pass it, unwilling to win with assistance. Yugo replied that Celina should always take the chances that she got, and he snatched it up instead. [7] 
 
         Celina prepares to perform a  Pendulum Summon .     
 Celina activated " Lunalight Reincarnation Dance ", to add her  Pendulum Monsters  " Lunalight Tiger " and " Lunalight Wolf " to her hand. She activated them on her next turn, thus beginning her counterattack by using the Pendulum Effects of both cards, bringing out " Lunalight Leo Dancer " to take down "Clear Wing". Yugo saved "Clear Wing" with " Rejuvenation ", so Celina attempted to use the effect of "Leo Dancer" to destroy it. Yugo was able to protect his Dragon with its effect, though the effect of "Leo Dancer" prevented Yugo from destroying it. Yugo used " Miracle Mirror " to protect "Clear Wing" from destruction this turn and hung on with 200 Life Points left. Yugo turned the tables by Summoning " Crystal Wing Synchro Dragon ". Yugo then attacked "Leo Dancer" with his "Crystal Wing", using its effect to overpower Celina's monster and win the Duel. [7] 
 
         Celina congratulates  Yugo  for his win.     
 Celina congratulated Yugo for winning, and she noted both Yuya's Dueling philosophy and Yugo's resemblance to Yuya. Despite punching Yugo in the face when he mistook her for Rin again, she left Yugo on friendly terms, and she headed for the  Underground Labor Facility . [7] 
 
         Celina under the effects of the nerve gas, watching as  Riley  Duels Sector Security.     
 While Celina was on her way to the underground, three Security officers knocked the stadium staff unconscious, which prompted Celina to challenge them to a Duel. However, before she could react, one Security member gassed her, which almost rendered her unconscious. They attempted to take her to Roget, but  Riley  showed up to rescue her. Celina tried to convince Riley not to fight, but he declined. She continued to watch his Duel against Security and was worried about Riley's well being. After Riley defeated the three Security members with a triple  One Turn Kill , she noticed how much he had changed. Moon Shadow arrived and take Celina and Riley to the Underground Labor Facility. [38] 
 During Yuya's Duel against  Crow Hogan  while she was on her way to the underground with Moon Shadow and Riley her  bracelet  glowed, causing her to wonder what was happening. [39]  The trio eventually began to tire, and Celina urged them to abandon her, but Riley and Moon refused to do so. Her bracelet eventually stopped glowing as they moved into the sewers. [40] 
 The Obelisk Force soon arrived but by then Celina and Riley were both so exhausted that they could no longer move on. Celina urged Riley and Moon Shadow to flee, but they refused. Celina helplessly watched as Riley defeated two groups of Obelisk Force by himself while Moon Shadow left to gather the Lancers in the Underground. She became concerned about Riley as he began to panic and remember the terror of his past. The two were rescued by Yuya, with him and Celina praising Riley. [41] 
 
         Yuya  saving Celina.     
 However, Barrett arrived on the scene and tried to convince Celina to surrender, but Celina refused to return to Duel Academy. When Barrett attempted to bribe her by claiming that he would convince Leo to let Celina out and fight as a Duel soldier, Celina refused the offer, disgusted with her former association and furious with Duel Academy's lies to her and their actions in Heartland, which went against her beliefs. She angrily declared that she would never associate with the Academy again. Celina watched Yuya struggle with Barrett and was touched with Yuya's promises that he would protect both her and Zuzu from Duel Academy. [42] 
 When Yuri arrived, Celina had enough with her helpless state. She tried to Duel to help Yuya and Riley, but struggled. She was surprised by Sora's sudden appearance and rescue. Remembering his malicious actions against Shay back in Standard, she became skeptical of Sora's defection, but was convinced as he prepared to duel  Yuri , only to be interrupted by Yugo's arrival and the Obelisk Force blocking her with "Ancient Gear Hunting Hound". Celina was stunned at " Starving Venom Fusion Dragon " after Yuri Summoned it, and was further shocked to see her bracelet resonating again due to the presence of the  Four Dimension Dragons . [43] 
 
         Celina sent back by  Barrett .     
 Celina was shocked when Yuya, Yugo, and Yuri started to  act   strange  but was surprised when Zuzu arrived and her bracelet teleported Yugo and Yuri away as well as ending her bracelet resonance ended. She quickly realized the danger Zuzu was in, and yelled at Zuzu to run away from the Obelisk Force. When Zuzu got trapped by Sergey's effects, Celina showed increasing fury at her inability to help get Zuzu away. Eventually, during the Duel between Yuya, Barrett, and Sergey, Barrett lost and activated the dimensional transporter on his Duel Disk, transporting him and Celina away. [11] 
 
 Heartland City 
         Celina capturing Zuzu.     
 After being brought back to Duel Academy, Celina was brainwashed by  The Doktor . [44]  When the Lancers and Zuzu couldn't find a boat to catch up to the ship that  Yusho Sakaki  was on, Celina appeared and told them to follow her to a ship. [45]  As they boarded the ship, Celina introduced the ship's captain,  Captain Cutter . While sailing, Celina told the Lancers how she escaped and found out where Lulu and Rin are. Duel Academy soldiers arrived by helicopter and Celina took Zuzu hostage. As they returned to Duel Academy, Celina reported that she had captured Zuzu and ignored her question about being comrades. [12]  She threw Zuzu into a cell and told her the Lancers would lose for the Professor's sake. When Celina left, a  small parasite tail  was seen retreating into her ear. [44] 
 
         Celina tells Yuya that one of the Doktor's parasites is in her brain.     
 Celina remained next to the Doktor, who was watching  Lulu  and Yuya on separate screens. He called her a  queen  as the insects were  drawn  towards something. [46]  She watched Lulu look for Kite and Duel Yuya until Shay arrived. She was sent to deal with Shay by the Doktor and tased him upon arriving. She joined the Duel, receiving the intrusion penalty while promising if Yuya wins she and Lulu will listen to him. She summoned " Fusion Parasite " and activated " Parasite Factory " to fuse her "Fusion Parasite" and Lulu's " Lyrical Luscinia - Independent Nightingale " equipped with "Fusion Parasite" to Fusion Summon " Parasite Queen ", equipped with both "Fusion Parasites", and she destroyed " The Phantom Knights of Cursed Javelin ". She told Yuya that not all of them were Duel Academy's enemies, and when Yuya tried to make her remember her leaving Duel Academy, she revealed that she did remember but claimed that it was all in the past. She showed Yuya the insects created by the Doktor, and revealed that the insects were in their head, and that Zuzu had one inside her head as well. She tried to tell Yuya to give up, but Yuya ordered her to be quiet and erupted in a rage over what had been done to Zuzu. To her and Lulu's shock,  Yuto  took over Yuya's body. [47] 
 Celina and Yuto's "Parasite Queen" and "Dark Rebellion Xyz Dragon" traded blows, and Celina eventually forced Yuto back, leaving Yuya in control. Yuya went after an Action Card, and Celina tried to grab it first but couldn't, however she noticed a Parasite Monster entering Yuya's ear. The Parasite struck and Yuya passed out. Believing him under the Parasite Monster's control, Celina called him their comrade but was surprised when he furiously denied that he was their ally. She and Lulu were annoyed that Yuya took all of their "Fusion Parasites", and they replenished them. The Doktor contacted Yuya and taunted him over Zuzu's control. Celina and Lulu smirked at Yuya's despair, but they noticed something was wrong when the "Fusion Parasites" recoiled in fear as they noticed a  dark aura  emanating from Yuya. Yuya and Yuto Xyz Summoned " Odd-Eyes Raging Dragon ". Despite the protection effects of their "Parasite" cards and facing Yuya two-on-one, the vicious effects of "Odd-Eyes Raging Dragon" negated their  Spell  and  Trap Cards  and allowed it to attack twice, defeating them both. She kicked Yuya in the stomach when he was distracted by Shay and escaped with Lulu, returning to the Doktor. Yuya pursed them and was trapped in the lab, and Celina left with her counterparts and the Doktor. [48] 
 
 Duel Academy 
         Celina and her counterparts in tubes behind the Professor.     
 Celina was summoned to  the Professor's  inner chambers in tubes with  her counterparts  and freed from  the Doktor 's control when the Professor sealed him into  a card . She asked the Professor what he was planning and learned how the Professor's daughter  Ray  defeated the  Supreme King Z-ARC  using  four cards  and split the  United World  into  Four Dimensions . Celina was surprised when the Professor revealed that she and her counterparts were reincarnations of Ray and would be fused back into her using  ARC-V . The Professor revealed that  Yuya , who had just broken into the room, was one of  Z-ARC 's reincarnations, and Celina didn't believe it was true. [16] 
 To Celina and her counterparts' shock, the Professor revealed that he had started the process to turn them back into one; their capsules started to move next to ARC-V, which would fuse them back into Ray and the Four Dimensions into the United World.  Rin  was surprised when  Declan   Synchro Summoned , and Celina told her it wasn't over, as Declan could use all Summoning methods. When Leo set the  Pendulum Scale , Celina noted that he couldn't  Pendulum Summon  due to the low Scales. Celina was worried when Leo destroyed " Odd-Eyes Pendulum Dragon " and when her capsule started to glow. Yuya entered his  Awakened  state and Leo revealed that Z-ARC was the demon dwelling inside Yuya, to Celina's surprise. She watched Leo take damage from the effect of Yuya's " Performapal Gatling Ghoul ", and noted that Yuya would win with the second effect of "Gatling Ghoul". [49] 
 
         Celina faints as ARC-V continues to power up.     
 The Professor managed to survive the effect, and Celina was surprised by the Professor's power when he Fusion Summoned " Master Spirit Tech Force - Pendulum Ruler " on Declan' turn. As the Duel progressed, Celina wondered whether was Yuya still himself or Z-ARC; Leo believed that Yuya was already Z-ARC, but  Rin  believed that Yuya was still there. She and her counterparts were surprised to see a dragon's silhouette form from Yuya's  dark aura . Celina still believed in Yuya when Zuzu asked him and Yuto to return to their real selves. However, when ARC-V powered up even more, Celina's capsule glowed brighter and they screamed in pain, prompting Yuya and Yuto to reawaken.  Yusho Sakaki  stepped in and restrained Yuya, and to the surprise of Celina and her counterparts were surprised Yusho agreed that they were Ray's alter egos and that Yuya was Z-ARC's. [50]  Although Yusho had asked Leo to stop ARC-V, he continued the process. Celina and her counterparts passed out due to the machine sucked out their life energy as ARC-V's energy input increased to fifty percent. [51]  While they were unconscious, purple energy passed from Celina and her counterparts' bodies into Riley. She shed tears while she was unconscious [52]  and she was transferred into ARC-V last, causing its completion, [53]  and joining her with the other girls to revive Ray, albeit only in spirit form due to Leo rushing the process, with Celina's spirit supposedly remained dormant.
 In the English Dub, it is implied that her spirit within Ray, along with Rin's and Lulu's, helped Yuya broke free from Z-ARC by reminding him of his goal to bring back peace and restore everyone's smile once more. [54]   [55] 
 
         Celina's spirit revived inside Zuzu.     
 Following the battle with Z-ARC, Celina's fate was unknown but Declan theorized that she most likely still inside the remnants of ARC-V. [56]  Leo managed to collect what appeared to be Ray's spirit, though he was unsure that it was Ray and theorized that Ray's fragments would eventually revive as Zuzu. [57]  After Yuya defeated Declan, Celina's spirit revived within Zuzu when Ray reacted to their Duel. [58] 
 
 Relationships 
 Yuya Sakaki 
 When he first saw her, he mistook her for Zuzu due to their similar appearance.  Yuya  and Celina generally get along well, given their shared goal of rescuing Zuzu, but Celina's impatience and hot-headed nature tend to clash with Yuya's more patient and cautious nature. Despite that, Yuya does value her as an ally and cares for her well-being, as he refused  Sora 's offer to trade her in exchange for Zuzu's safety from Duel Academy, saying he couldn't abandon Celina. Yuya continues to defy Barrett and refused to stand down and hand over Celina or Zuzu.
 Celina's Duel with Yugo later made her understand Yuya's intention of trying to make people smile through Dueling. Making her at some point to say Yuya's catchphrase "ladies and gentlemen". Her bond with Yuya and Zuzu has also softened her character and personality, and she has come to be deeply concerned for her fellow Lancers' well-being, especially Riley, Yuya, and Zuzu.
 
 Zuzu Boyle 
 Despite only meeting for a short time, Celina values  Zuzu  dearly and above all others, expressing remorse after she thought that her counterpart had been sealed in a card by the Obelisk Force and promising to help Yuya find her in the  Synchro Dimension . She was shown expressing pride at Zuzu's Dueling initially prevailing against  Sergey Volkov 's, and she was horrified at Zuzu's brutal defeat. [34] 
 Zuzu is the first counterpart Celina physically interacts with, and arguably the closest person to Celina. As such Celina is very protective of her. Celina was very alarmed when she reunited with Zuzu in an area surrounded by the Obelisk Force again, telling Zuzu to run away while struggling to get up. She was upset to see Zuzu trapped by the effects of Sergey's cards, and continued to worry for her as she was transported away. 
 When they reunited with each other in Fusion Dimension, Zuzu was happy and glad that she was actually safe. But, Celina had no problem in capturing Zuzu for Duel Academy without any hesitation. She also showed no remorse for what she done to her counterpart, much to Zuzu's sadness. However, this was due to the Doktor's Parasites controlling Celina's actions than of Celina's own will.
 
 Yugo 
 Celina initially respected Yugo for the skill he displayed in his Duel with  Sylvio Sawatari , but changed her opinion upon meeting him. She was annoyed by Yugo's attempts to hug her for mistaking her for  Rin  and derided his more spontaneous Dueling style compared to her own. Celina later changed her assessment of Yugo during their Duel, and they parted friends afterwards. Celina was surprised to notice Yugo's resemblance to Yuya, but she kept this surprise to herself.
 
 Deck 
 Celina plays a  " Lunalight " Deck  focused on  Fusion Summoning . Her ace card is " Lunalight Cat Dancer ", which she reinforces with cards such as " Lunalight White Rabbit ", " Lunalight Perfume " and " Lunalight Dance " to disrupt the opponent's  field  and allow "Cat Dancer" to  attack  multiple times via its  effect . Celina usually defaults to this strategy, seeing a consistently used strategy as being the best in Dueling. [6]  Celina's  Fusion Monsters  focus on an ascending series of "Dancer" monsters that use their preceding counterparts as  Fusion Material . During the  Friendship Cup , Celina uses  Pendulum Monsters  in her Deck to support her previous strategy.

 Trivia 
 Unlike  her   dimensional   counterparts  and their relationships with  their   male   companions , Celina does not have any sort of relationship with  Yuri .
 She is also the only one among them who uses a second  summoning method  outside of her brainwashing by the " Fusion Parasite " (like Rin and Lulu) or picking up temporary Pendulum Monsters during the Arc League Championship Battle Royale (like Zuzu). 
 With the exception of Yuri, Celina has dueled against each of  Z-ARC 's reincarnations at least once.
 This is parallel to Yuya, who dueled against three out of four of  Ray Akaba 's reincarnations.
