 Appeareance 
       Full-body image of Rayne.     
 Rayne is a bespectacled fair-skinned girl with hazel eyes and blonde hair in a severe hairstyle, similar to her brother,  Rino . She dresses smartly in a grey waistcoat and green sleeveless, neck-less top resembling a corset over a white shirt, red tie, and grey miniskirt, with knee-length blue socks and brown slip-on shoes. Rayne wears rectangular spectacles with a blue half-frame.
 When  Gavin  Duels using Sogetsu Style (and later when aided  Romin  in cooking, Rayne dons  Kuroko  stagehand clothing; a charcoal veil with a black band, a grey top and pants, black tunic and shoes, and a blue sash. [2] [3] 
 
 Personality 
 Rayne is very devoted to Gavin and her duties, to the point of acting in the manner she views as the best course of action, regardless of Gavin's wishes. She attempts to convince Gavin to abandon his interest in Rush Dueling and return to his duties, showing satisfaction at the notion that Gavin would not be dealing with Yuga and his friends again. [2]  Rayne is somewhat snarkier than her twin, being more outwardly critical of Romin's cooking while she was aiding her. [3]  It's later revealed that in her free time she secretly spies on Yuga in order to find out if he is a good choice as a friend for Gavin. By doing so she developed feelings for Yuga, even though she denies this.  [4]  It's revealed by her brother that she actually has the habit to fall very fast in love with different people. According to Rayne herself she has so far 75 love diaries, one for each love interest. When in love she also to misinterpreted what her love interest is actually saying and fantasizes a love declaration towards her. This has the nickname "Rayne Eyes". [5]
