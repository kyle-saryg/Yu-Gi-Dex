 " Frightfur ", known as " Death-Toy " (デストーイ  Desutōi ) in the  OCG , is an  archetype  of  Fiend   monsters  used by  Sora Perse  in  Yu-Gi-Oh! ARC-V  anime and  manga . The majority of its members are  DARK   Fusion Monsters . The "Frightfur" monsters serve as "bosses" for both the " Edge Imp " and " Fluffal " archetypes since the  Fusion Materials  used for their  Fusion Summon  reside in these archetypes.

 Design 
 Appearance 
       " Frightfur Bear ", " Frightfur Leo " and " Frightfur Sheep ".     
 "Frightfur" monsters are based off of corrupted versions of animals from " Fluffal " archetype. They feature a destroyed plush toy that was re-fabricated with their respective " Edge Imp " tools or weapons inside them, giving them a more demonic and terrifying appearance, in contrast to the "Fluffal" monsters. The artwork of " Frightfur Factory " depicts the transformation of "Fluffal" to "Frightfur" monsters. In the  TCG  and English  ARC-V  anime, the blades of the "Frightfur" monsters are given a glow to avoid references to actual weapons.
 
 Etymology 
 "Frightfur" is a pun on "frightful" and "fur". Their Japanese name "Death-Toy" directly describes their menacing appearances, and can also be a pun on "destroy".
 
 Members 
 This archetype is classified into three types of monsters.
 
 Mini-Boss 
 The Mini-Boss monsters use "Edge Imp" and "Fluffal" monsters as material. In the anime, they use a specified "Edge Imp" and "Fluffal" monster instead of any.
