 Featured Duel: Seto Kaiba vs. Joey Wheeler - Part 2 
 Duel continues from previous episode. 
 Joey has 2200  Life Points  remaining and controls "Swordsman of Landstar" (500/1200) in Attack Position.
 Kaiba has 2800 Life Points remaining and controls no cards.
 Turn 5: Seto Kaiba 
Kaiba draws. He then Normal Summons " Blade Knight " (1600/1000) in Attack Position. "Blade Knight" attacks and destroys " Swordsman of Landstar " ( Joey  2200 → 1100). Kaiba Sets a card.
 Turn 6: Joey Wheeler 
Joey draws. He then Normal Summons " Little-Winguard " (1400/1800) in Attack Position. Joey then activates " Legendary Sword " with the intention to equip it to "Little-Winguard" and raise its  ATK / DEF  by 300, but Seto activates his face-down " Absorb Spell " to switch the target of "Legendary Sword" to "Blade Knight" instead ("Blade Knight": 1600 → 1900/1000 → 1300). Joey then Sets a card.
 Turn 7: Seto Kaiba 
Kaiba draws. He then activates " Enemy Controller " to pay 1000  Life Points  ( Seto  2800 → 1800) and take control of "Little-Winguard". Kaiba then activates " Cost Down " to downgrade the  Level  of every monster in his hand and field by two this turn. Since Seto has at most one card left in his  Hand , the effect of "Blade Knight" increases its ATK by 400 ("Blade Knight": 1900 → 2300/1300). 
 Kaiba then  Tributes  "Little-Winguard" in order to Tribute Summon " Blue-Eyes White Dragon " (3000/2500) in Attack Position. "Blue-Eyes White Dragon" attacks directly, but Joey activates his face-down " Scapegoat " to  Special Summon  four " Sheep Tokens " (0/0 for all) in  Defense Position . "Blue-Eyes White Dragon" and "Blade Knight" attack & destroy two of Joey's "Sheep Tokens".
 Turn 8: Joey Wheeler 
Joey draws "Battle Warrior". He then Sets a card and Normal Summons " Battle Warrior " (700/1000) in  Defense Position .
 Turn 9: Seto Kaiba 
Kaiba draws " Card of Demise " and subsequently activates it to draw until he has five cards in his hand (his hand is empty so he draws five cards). Five turns after "Card of Demise's" activation, Seto must discard his entire hand during his Standby Phase ("Blade Knight": 2300 → 1900/1300). Kaiba then Normal Summons " Kaiser Sea Horse " (1700/1650) in  Attack Position . "Blade Knight", "Kaiser Sea Horse", and "Blue-Eyes White Dragon" attack and destroy Joey's "Battle Warrior" and two remaining "Sheep Tokens".
 Turn 10: Joey Wheeler 
Joey draws " Pot of Greed " and subsequently activates it to draw two cards. Joey then activates his face-down " Graverobber " to steal "Enemy Controller" from Seto's  Graveyard  and activate it as his card, allowing Joey to pay 1000  Life Points  and activate the second effect of "Enemy Controller", which will destroy one of Seto's monsters. Joey chooses to have "Enemy Controller's" second effect destroy "Blue-Eyes White Dragon" ( Joey  1100 → 100). 
 Joey then activates " Monster Reborn " to revive Seto's "Blue-Eyes White Dragon" (3000/2500) in Attack Position and under his control. "Blue-Eyes White Dragon" attacks & destroys "Blade Knight" ( Seto  1800 → 700). Joey then Normal Summons " Hayabusa Knight " (1000/700) in  Defense Position  and Sets a card.
 Turn 11: Seto Kaiba 
Kaiba draws "Monster Reborn". He then Tributes "Kaiser Sea Horse" in order to Tribute Summon "Blue-Eyes White Dragon" (3000/2500) in Attack Position (as "Kaiser Sea Horse" counts as two Tributes for the Tribute Summon of a LIGHT monster). Kaiba's "Blue-Eyes White Dragon" attacks Joey's "Blue-Eyes White Dragon". Both monsters are destroyed in a  Double KO . Kaiba then activates "Monster Reborn" to revive one " Blue-Eyes White Dragon " (3000/2500) in Attack Position.
 Duel concludes next episode.
