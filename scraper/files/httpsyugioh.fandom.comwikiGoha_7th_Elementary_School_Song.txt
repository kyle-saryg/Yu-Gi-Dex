 Trivia 
 The song is performed by the voice actors of Yuga, Luke, Gakuto, and Romin, with there being multiple different versions.
 For the first 26 episodes, only the three male characters are singing, with each character having solo parts, and the rest sung as a trio. 
 Starting with the ending of the 27th episode, Romin's voice actor also joins the song, there being five versions from this point onwards, one where each of the four main characters is singing most of the song solo, and one where the entire piece is sung together. 
 Romin's solo version also has an additional electric guitar track that is not featured in any of the other solo or group versions of the song. 
 The end credit visuals from the first 26 episodes mainly feature Yuga, Luke, and Gakuto, and their respective  signature monsters . Romin and her monster were added more prominently beginning from episode 27.
 The scenes during the ending also seem to relate to which version of the song is played, with the solo versions mostly showing scenes focusing on the performing character, while the quartet versions show different scenes featuring supporting characters.
