 Legendary Collection 4: Joey's World Mega Pack  is a  Mega-Pack  released with  Legendary Collection 4: Joey's World  boxes.
 The set contains close to 300 cards, featuring ones used by or related to ones used by  Joey Wheeler ,  Mai Valentine ,  Yami Marik ,  Rex Raptor ,  Bandit Keith ,  Bonz , the  Paradox Brothers ,  Duke Devlin ,  Serenity Wheeler  and  The Big Five , as well as a number of presumably Halloween-themed cards such as  Zombie  monsters and cards from the " Vampire ", " Archfiend ", " Dark World " and " Gravekeeper's "  archetypes .

 Trivia 
 True to the product page's claims, any single Common card is harder to find than any single Secret Rare card in this set, as the probability of getting a particular Secret Rare card is 1/26 per pack while the probability of getting a particular Common card is only 1/44 per pack. This is the opposite from the vast majority of other sets. 
 Nine of Joey's Normal Monsters in this set have their English flavor texts written in his Brooklyn accent: "Alligator's Sword", "Meotoko", "Skull Stalker", "Wolf", "Kageningen", "Stone Armadiller", "Hero of the East", "Anthrosaurus" and "Little D". Except for "Alligator's Sword", all of these were released in English for the first time in this set. 
 Following the  reprint  of " Axe of Despair " in  Battle Pack 2: War of the Giants , this set printed the  archetype condition  text "(This card is always treated as an "Archfiend" card.)" on the remaining "Archfiend" cards that originally lacked the word "Archfiend" in their English names for the first time, clarifying them as archetype members. As of the release of this set, there are no longer any "Archfiend" cards that lack such clarification.
