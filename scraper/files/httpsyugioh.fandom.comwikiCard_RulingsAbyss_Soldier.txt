 While an effect like that of " Banisher of the Radiance " or " Macro Cosmos " is active, it is impossible to discard a card to the Graveyard.  The activation costs of the effects of " Jowgen the Spiritualist ", " Abyss Soldier " and " Return of the Doomed " require you to discard a card to the Graveyard, which is impossible, so you cannot activate their effects.  However, the activation costs of effects like " Magic Jammer " only require you to discard a card, so you can activate their effects since the card does not need to be discarded to the Graveyard.
