For the card(s), see " The Eye of Truth " or " Senri Eye ".            The Eye of Anubis on  Dark Yugi 's forehead.     
 The  Eye of Anubis , commonly called the  Millennium Symbol  in the anime and referred to as the  Millennium Eye  in the  OCG / TCG [1] , only appears when a  Millennium Item  holder is either using "Shadow Magic," or when someone else is under the control of another  Millennium Item . It also appears on all of the Millennium Items, except for the  Millennium Key .
 Uniquely among its depictions on the other Millennium Items, the Eye of Anubis on the  Millennium Puzzle  closely resembles the  Eye of Wdjat  (which is fitting given the Puzzle's association with the  Pharaoh ).
 In the  TCG  and  OCG , cards from  Series 2  onward have an  Eye of Anubis Hologram  in the lower right-hand corner.
