 Summary 
       Art 's comic sketch of  Yuma .     
 At  Heartland Academy ,  Yuma  and his friends are walking along, talking about their test scores. Their conversation is interrupted by a boy in a beret calling out to Yuma, who asks who he is. He introduces himself as  Art Stanley , the president of the school's  Comic Book Appreciation Club .  Bronk  doesn't seem to know what the club is and  Caswell  comments that it has only one member. Spinning his pencil, Art tells Yuma he has a request. He's currently dedicated his club to a "great masterpiece" and he wishes to use Yuma as his model for the main character.  Ray  thinks that sounds like a great idea. Yuma seems excited and Art says that as Yuma is the champion of the  WDC , there is no better model. He holds up a sketch of Yuma, dressed in a superhero costume. Yuma seems impressed, while Art suddenly asks Yuma what his weakness is. Yuma claims he has no weakness, causing his friends to wince. Art says that's good to hear and then tells Yuma to hold on (in the dub, Art responds that all heroes have weaknesses before leaving).
 
       Art's comic sketch of  Shark .     Seeing  Shark  nearby, Art rushes over and calls out to him, asking if he'll become a model for his manga as well. He shows him the sketch he based on him, featuring Shark with metallic claws and demonic wings. Shark says the design makes no sense (in the dub, he calls it lame) and walks off. Art chases him and places his hand on Shark's shoulder, asking him to wait. Shark tells him to get his hand off of him and Art begins by saying he's begging Shark. Shark repeats that he needs to take his hand off him and pushes him away, one of the  rings  flying off of his finger in the process. Art reaches for the dropped ring, but Shark yells for him not to touch it and picks it up before walking off. Handing Art his dropped sketchbook, Yuma asks if he's alright. Art thanks him, saying his sketchbook is more important than his life - it contains all of his ideas and designs for comics. Yuma says he'll look forward to his comic then and rushes after Shark, his friends following. Yuma comments that Shark's tongue is as sharp as always. Shark asks what's wrong with stating the truth. (in the dub, Yuma asks how well Shark did on the test, with the latter responding with "Whatever".) 
       Shark  and  Rio  as children.     
 Later, Shark visits  Rio  at the hospital. Standing by her bedside, he wonders just when she'll finally awaken again. Opening his palm, he stares at the two rings. He recalls when he and Rio attended a carnival years ago. Rio held out the rings to him and Shark had responded he didn't want to wear one of them in a pair with her and adds that a man shouldn't wear a ring anyway (in the dub, Shark says he's Rio's big brother, not her big sister). Rio angrily throws the rings on the ground and walks off, calling him an idiot (in the dub, Rio calls Shark's comment a mean thing to say). Now, Shark slides one of the rings onto her finger, before staring at the one of his own. From the doorway, Art watches, having apparently followed Shark. Back at the Comic Book Appreciation Club, Art discusses things with  Girag , who asks why they'd attack Shark now. Art tells him that though he was unable to find out Yuma's weak point, he did discover Shark's. Art claims every step of the plan is illustrated in his sketchbook. 
 
         Girag  shows off his artwork.     Girag approves the plan and Art vows to do his best for the glory of the  Barian World . Girag then tells him he tried to draw some manga as well and holds two sheets of paper up, which feature poorly drawn black-and-white figures. He asks if they're pretty good and Art responds with "I guess..." (in the dub, Art didn't say anything, but his sweatdrops are still present). 
 The next day, Yuma,  Tori  and Ray approach  Heartland Hospital . Ray says they brought enough food for a hospital visit and Tori tells him that she already informed him that Shark's sister is still unconscious, so she won't be able to eat. Yuma says that's fine, he'll eat them in her place. As they near the steps, Shark runs down the steps in a panic. Yuma says they're here to visit his sister and Shark mutters that Rio has disappeared from her room. Yuma wonders where she is now then. Art approaches them, saying it's a coincidence that they're all here. He wonders if they're looking for Rio. Shark asks what he would know about her and Art laughs, saying he'll tell Shark where she is on one condition: Shark must  Duel  him. Yuma tells him to stop this nonsense, (in the dub, Yuma asks where Rio is) while  Astral  appears from the  Emperor's Key , telling Yuma he can feel a strange aura coming from him. Art, glowing with a red aura, asks what Shark's answer is and Shark agrees to Duel him, with both players setting up their  D-Pads  and  D-Gazers . 
 
         " Lancelot, Knight of the Lake " and " Tristan, Knight of Tragedy ".     Shark says he won't forgive Art and takes the first  turn ,  Normal Summoning  " Shocktopus ", who appears in a wave of water. Explaining that he's  Tributing  his  WATER - Attribute   monster , "Shocktopus" vanishes and Shark  Special Summons  " Sharkraken " from his  hand  via its own  effect  in  Attack Position .  Setting  a card, he ends his turn. Art laughs and begins his turn,  activating  a  Field Spell Card , " Comic Field ". The hospital is replaced with a medieval castle, while the ground around them becomes a rocky expanse. Art reveals that his field is from his comic, and within it everything will be decided by the stories he's already written. He adds that this means the real hero is one of love, courage and frankness - a hero created by Art. This match will end in Shark's defeat. Art Normal Summons " Lancelot, Knight of the Lake " and activates " Vow of the Sword ", explaining that when he  controls  a  Warrior - Type  monster, he may Special Summon another  Level  4 or lower Warrior from his hand. He Special Summons " Tristan, Knight of Tragedy " in Attack Position. Astral comments that there are two Level 4 monsters and Art  overlays  them to  Xyz Summon  " Comics Hero King Arthur " in Attack Position. The effect of "Lancelot" activates; when it is used as an  Overlay Unit , he can reduce the  ATK  of an opponent's monster by 800. The ATK of "Sharkraken" drops to 1600 and Art orders "King Arthur" to  attack  it. 
         Rio  in Art's comic world.     
 Shark calls him naive and explains that his  face-down  card is " Zeus' Breath " and that it will  negate  the ATK and inflict 800  damage  to Art. Shark moves to activate it, but Art asks if he's really sure he wants to do that (in the dub, Art asks if Shark truly cares about his sister). He says he'll tell him something about Rio right now. She is in Art's fantasy world (in the dub, Art struggles to think of a name for his world before settling for "Artopia"). A picture of Rio appears, unconscious on the floor of a cell, with her eyes still wrapped in bandages. Shark says this is impossible and Art claims that if Shark defeats him, his fantasy world will be destroyed. Art wonders what would become of Rio if that happened, laughing maniacally. Tori calls that a despicable tactic. Art tells Shark that he can't win and to allow him to recover his " Number " now. He resumes his attack, yelling " Radiant Sword ". "King Arthur" fires a beam out of its sword, which obliterates "Sharkraken", drops Shark's  Life Points  to 3200 and throws him onto his back. Art Sets a card to end his turn.
 
         Tori  suggests a course of a action.     
 Yuma muses that at this rate Shark will lose. Astral says it's as he expected; Art is an assassin of the  Barian World . From the top of one of the cliffs formed by "Comic Field", Girag stands, laughing and claiming its over for Shark now (in the dub, Girag congratulates Art on a job well done, while also adding that Shark's "Number" is as good as theirs). Tori asks if there's something they could do to save Rio. Astral responds that the world is Art's creation. Remembering the sketchbook from earlier, Tori suggests Yuma goes to find it. The world itself should be drawn in that sketchbook. Yuma thinks she may be right - the sketchbook could have some hints. He, Ray and Astral rush off to find it, with Yuma vowing to save Rio. Shark begins his turn by Normal Summoning " Hammer Shark ". Art is annoyed at the weak monster and insists Shark Summon his "Number" now. He adds he'll have to help Shark Summon it, then. He activates his face-down " Ordeal of the Hero ", explaining that when he controls a " Comics Hero " monster and his opponent Summons a monster, this card will Special Summon two monsters from his opponent's  Deck  with the same Level as the Summoned monster. 
 
         Art allows Shark to Summon more monsters.     
 Shark Special Summons " Spear Shark " and " Double Shark ", with Art insisting that Shark bring out his "Number". Shark complies, overlaying his three Level 4 monsters to Xyz Summon " Number 32: Shark Drake " in Attack Position. Shark asks Art what to do next - he shouldn't attack, after all. Art urges him to attack this time as all of Shark's attacks have already been predicated by Art's story. He adds that when forced into a pinch by a strong opponent, a true hero can always rise up (In the dub, the story has Shark raid Artopia to kidnap Princess Rio to steal her power, with Artimus Stanleyus coming in to save Rio with the forces of good, resulting in a battle). Shark wonders what Art is planning, but determines he has no other option but to do as he's told. He orders "Shark Drake" to attack "King Arthur" with " Deep Sea Destruction ". "King Arthur" explodes and Art is pitched to the ground, his Life Points at 3600. Art seems shaken, saying he can't believe "King Arthur" was defeated. He yells for "King Arthur", saying that world peace and the hope of all are entrusted to him. Smiling, he explains the effect of "Comic Field". When a "Comics Hero" monster is  destroyed by battle , this card will prevent its destruction and increase its ATK by 500. "King Arthur" reappears, its ATK rising to 2900. Now he activates the effect of "King Arthur",  detaching  an Overlay Unit as its ATK was changed. The difference between the old and new ATK will be inflicted to Shark as damage. He declares " Storm Sword " and a fierce cyclone is fired from the sword of "King Arthur", dropping Shark to 2700. Tori yells Shark's name, while Art asks how the "underling of evil" ("spawn of evil" in the dub) feels after such an attack. Shark responds by Setting a card and ending his turn.
 
         " CXyz Comics Hero Legend Arthur " is Summoned.     
 Art starts his turn,  equipping  "King Arthur" with " Miracle Sword ", which increases its ATK by 500. Tori is concerned as the ATK changed again and Art repeats his previous move, detaching an Overlay Unit to inflict more damage to Shark with "Storm Sword". Saying he's not done, he orders "King Arthur" to attack "Shark Drake" with "Flash Sword". Shark's Life Points fall to 1600, but Art comments that he can't destroy "Shark Drake" since "King Arthur" isn't a "Number", but that even that was already written in the story. Art activates the other effect of "Miracle Sword". If the equipped monster fails to destroy a monster by battle, he can  send  it to the Graveyard to activate a  Spell Card  from his hand. The  Barian Emblem  appears on Art's forehead as he vows to defeat the evil for the Barian World and activates " Rank-Up-Magic Barian's Force ". He  Ranks-Up  "King Arthur" and performs a  Chaos Xyz Evolution  to Special Summon " CXyz Comics Hero Legend Arthur " in Attack Position. Shark comments that this must be the new power of Barian, then (in the dub, Shark comments on the 3000 ATK of "Legend Arthur"). Art reveals that when a " CXyz " is Summoned with "Barian's Force", it steals the Overlay Units of an opponent's monster with " Chaos Drain ".
 
         Art's sketch of Rio.     
 "Legend Arthur" absorbs the Units from "Shark Drake". The ATK of "Shark Drake" then decreases by 300 for each absorbed Unit. Art says the battle isn't over yet and specifies that monsters Summoned with "Barian's Force" can destroy "Numbers". He orders "Legend Arthur" to attack and destroy "Shark Drake" with " Shockwash Slash ". Shark's Life Points fall to 500. Yuma contacts Shark through his D-Pad, telling him he's found Art's sketchbook at the Comic Book Appreciation Club. Yuma clarifies that there are pictures of Rio in there as a captured heroine. Shark is enraged, but Art says that while Yuma found the sketchbook, that fact won't change the ending. Tori asks what he means and Art tells his story. In order to release the captured princess, Shark, who is the "devil's messenger" fights Art, who is the hero. Art wins (Art's sword piercing Shark is removed from the dub), but it's too late to save the princess; she is already in her eternal sleep. This means Shark will lose and his sister will not be saved.
 
         Rio awakens and immediately chides Shark.     
 Ray asks Yuma if there's really nothing they can do. Yuma says he can't accept the future being decided by something like that. He urges Shark to get up and fight; he's the only one who can save his sister. He tells him to crush everything in his way - he is still Shark, isn't he? (in the dub, Yuma asks if even a little fanfiction can stop Shark) Hearing his sister's voice in his memories, Shark rises to his feet. He may not know what his future holds, but he vows he'll always protect her. He begs Rio to wake up. Both rings glow with pink energy and the fantasy world shatters. He hears Rio's voice again and she's now standing on one of the ramparts that are part of "Comic Field". The wind blows her bandages off and she opens her eyes. Art is in disbelief, while Tori smiles. Ray cheers and Astral comments that his feelings for his sister have broken Barian's curse. Rio looks at Shark and asks if he's really going to lose this Duel. She asks how he dares lose in front of her and turns away. Shark asks who she thinks he's Dueling for (in the dub, Shark retorts that he's losing because of her). Art yells he can't allow this and activates the effect of "Legend Arthur" by detaching an Overlay Unit. When it destroys a monster by battle, he can  banish  that monster from the Graveyard to inflict damage to Shark equal to the monster's ATK. Shark smiles as Art is blasted backwards instead of him. He explains he's activated his face-down " Torrential Reborn ", which can be activated when a WATER monster is destroyed - it will Special Summon the WATER monster and inflict 500 damage to Art. "Shark Drake" reappears and Art's Life Points fall to 3100.
 
         Shark carries Rio off.     
 Shark's turn is next and he immediately performs a Chaos Xyz Evolution, overlaying "Shark Drake" to Special Summon " Number C32: Shark Drake Veiss " in Attack Position. Shark activates its effect, detaching an Overlay Unit and banishing a " Shark " monster from his Graveyard to decrease the ATK of "Legend Arthur" by the banished monster's ATK. He banishes "Shark Drake", dropping the ATK of "Legend Arthur" to 200. He then activates " Surging Erosion ", which can destroy a Field Spell Card. "Comic Field" vanishes and the rampart where Rio stands is revealed to be a water tower. Art is devastated by the destruction of his masterpiece. Shark continues that "Surging Erosion" will also increase the ATK of all WATER monsters by 500. The ATK of "Shark Drake Veiss" rises to 3300 and Shark orders an attack with " Chaos Stream ", destroying "Legend Arthur" and dropping Art to 0 Life Points. 
 
         Art's new concept for Shark.     
 The Barian Emblem vanishes from Art's forehead as Yuma cheers for Shark's victory. Girag is annoyed, saying it was so close, but now dismissing Art as a "useless loony" before vanishing. (in the dub, Girag says he is sick of being left empty-handed and that he needs to find better puppets) Shark gets to Rio, who mutters his name. (in the dub, Rio tells Shark to bring her home) He silently proceeds to carry her away. The next day at school, Art approaches Shark again, saying he has a new character model based on him - a samurai hero. Yuma likes the design, but Shark dismisses it as "silly" ("solidly lame" in the dub) and walks off again. Yuma asks about his design and Art shows another picture, featuring Shark's character fighting a golem who has just crushed Yuma's character beneath his foot. Astral and Tori agree it's a fitting place for Yuma. (in the dub, Astral makes Observation Number 21: Yuma would make a good cartoon character in real life) Enraged and embarrassed, Yuma leaps up in the air, screaming why he isn't the main character after all.
 
 Featured Duel: Reginald "Shark" Kastle vs. Art Stanley 
         Shark  vs.  Art .     
 Turn 1: Shark 
 Shark  draws. He then  Normal Summons  " Shocktopus " ( 4/1600/800) in Attack Position. Shark then  Tributes  "Shocktopus" in order to  Special Summon  " Sharkraken " ( 6/2400/2100) from his  hand  in  Attack Position  via its own  effect  (as "Shocktopus" is a  WATER  monster). Shark  Sets  a card.
 Turn 2: Art 
 Art  draws. He then  activates  " Comic Field ". Now, when a " Comics Hero "  monster  would be  destroyed by battle , it will gain 500  ATK  instead. Art then Normal Summons " Lancelot, Knight of the Lake " ( 4/1500/1700) in Attack Position. As he  controls  a Warrior-Type monster, Art activates " Vow of the Sword " to Special Summon " Tristan, Knight of Tragedy " ( 4/1400/1800) in Attack Position (as "Tristan, Knight of Tragedy" is a  Level  4 or lower  Warrior - Type  monster). Art  overlays  "Lancelot, Knight of the Lake" and "Tristan, Knight of Tragedy" in order to  Xyz Summon  " Comics Hero King Arthur " ( 4/2400/1200, ORU: 2) in Attack Position. 
 As "Lancelot, Knight of the Lake" was used as an  Overlay Unit  for the Xyz Summon of "Comics Hero King Arthur", Art activates the effect of "Lancelot, Knight of the Lake" to decrease the  ATK  of "Sharkraken" by 800 ("Sharkraken": 2400 → 1600 ATK). "Comics Hero King Arthur"  attacks  "Sharkraken". Shark begins to activate his  face-down  " Zeus' Breath ", but ceases his action after Art threatens  Rio 's life. "Comics Hero King Arthur" then destroys "Sharkraken" (Shark: 4000 → 3200 LP). Art Sets a card.
 Turn 3: Shark  
Shark draws. He then Normal Summons " Hammer Shark " ( 4/1700/1500) in Attack Position. As Shark Normal Summoned a monster while Art controls a " Comics Hero " monster, Art activates his face-down " Ordeal of the Hero " to force Shark to Special Summon two monsters with the same Level as "Hammer Shark" from his  Deck  with their effects  negated . If he cannot, he will take 400  damage . Shark Special Summons " Spear Shark " ( 4/1600/1400) and " Double Shark " ( 4/1200/1600) in Attack Position. 
 Shark overlays "Hammer Shark", "Spear Shark", and "Double Shark" in order to Xyz Summon " Number 32: Shark Drake " ( 4/2800/2100, ORU: 3) in Attack Position. "Shark Drake" attacks "Comics Hero King Arthur" (Art: 4000 → 3600 LP), but Art activates the effect of "Comic Field" to prevent his monster's destruction ("Comics Hero King Arthur": 2400 → 2900 LP). As its ATK was changed, Art activates the effect of "Comics Hero King Arthur" to  detach  an Overlay Unit ("Comics Hero King Arthur": 2 → 1 ORU) and inflict damage to Shark equal to the change in ATK (Shark: 3200 → 2700 LP). Shark Sets a card.
 Turn 4: Art 
Art draws. He then  equips  "King Arthur" with " Miracle Sword ", increasing its ATK by 500 ("Comics Hero King Arthur": 2900 → 3400 ATK). Art activates the effect of "Comics Hero King Arthur" ("Comics Hero King Arthur": 1 → 0 ORU) (Shark: 2700 → 2200 LP). "Comics Hero King Arthur" attacks "Shark Drake", but the latter isn't destroyed as "Comics Hero King Arthur" is not a " Number " (Shark: 2200 → 1600 LP). As "Comics Hero King Arthur" failed to "Shark Drake" in battle, Art activates the second effect of "Miracle Sword" to  send  it to the  Graveyard  and activate " Rank-Up-Magic Barian's Force ",  Ranking Up  "Comics Hero King Arthur" via  Chaos Xyz Evolution  in order to Xyz Summon " Chaos Xyz Comics Hero Legend Arthur " ( 5/3000/2400, ORU: 1) in Attack Position. The third effect of "Rank-Up-Magic Barian's Force" then detaches the Overlay Units of "Shark Drake" ("Shark Drake": 3 → 0 ORU), attaches them to "Comics Hero Legend Arthur" ("Comics Hero Legend Arthur": 1 → 4 ORU), and decreases the ATK of "Shark Drake" by 300 for each Overlay Unit it lost ("Shark Drake": 2800 → 1900 ATK). 
 "Comics Hero Legend Arthur" attacks and destroys "Shark Drake" (Shark: 1600 → 500 LP) as the second effect of "Rank-Up-Magic Barian's Force" allows the summoned monster to negate effects which prevent destruction by battle. As "Comics Hero Legend Arthur" destroyed a monster by battle and sent it to the Graveyard, Art activates its effect, detaching a Chaos Overlay Unit ("Comics Hero Legend Arthur": 4 → 3) to  banish  the destroyed monster and inflict damage to Shark equal to its ATK. Shark activates his face-down " Torrential Reborn " (as a  WATER  monster he controlled was destroyed by battle) to revive "Shark Drake" ( 4/2800/2100) in Attack Position and inflict 500 damage to Art (Art: 3600 → 3100 LP). This makes the effect of "Comics Hero Legend Arthur"  resolve  without effect.
 Turn 5: Shark 
Shark draws. He then overlays "Shark Drake" with itself via Chaos Xyz Evolution in order to Xyz Summon " Chaos Number 32: Shark Drake Veiss " ( 4/2800/2100, ORU: 1) in Attack Position. Shark then activates the effect of "Shark Drake Veiss" to detach "Shark Drake" ("Shark Drake Veiss": 1 → 0 ORU), banish "Shark Drake" (a " Shark " monster) from his Graveyard and decrease the ATK of "Comics Hero Legend Arthur" by the ATK of "Shark Drake" ("Comics Hero Legend Arthur": 3000 → 200 ATK). Shark activates " Surging Erosion " to destroy "Comic Field" and increase the ATK of all face-up WATER monsters by 500 ("Shark Drake Veiss": 2800 → 3300 ATK). "Shark Drake Veiss" attacks and destroys "Comics Hero Legend Arthur" (Art: 3100 → 0 LP).

 When " Comics Hero King Arthur " was  Xyz Summoned , it looks as if it is a  LIGHT - Attribute   monster  due to its  Overlay Units  being yellow even though it is an  EARTH -Attribute monster. 
 During the episode preview after the opening,  Art 's sketch of  Shark  has a blank text box in it. In the episode proper, the text box shows the letters "UGU". 
 At a certain point, the cards in Art's  hand  have the old  card backings . The new card backings is correctly shown throughout the rest of the episode.
