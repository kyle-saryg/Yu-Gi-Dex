 History 
 Ancient Egypt 
 Many pharaohs were buried here along with their treasure.
 After  Aknamkanon  learned of how the  Millennium Items  were created, he fell into a depression which led to his death. Subsequently, he was buried here.
 While Aknamkanon's son  Atem  ruled as pharaoh,  Thief Bakura  raided the tomb of Aknamkanon, stealing its treasures and dragged Aknamkanon's corpse to the temple.
 Atem defeated  Zorc Necrophades , sacrificing his life in the process. A portion of Atem's soul was sealed in the  Millennium Puzzle , which was laid to rest along with Atem in his tomb in the valley, which later became known as the  Tomb of the Nameless Pharaoh .
 
 Solomon Muto's expedition (1960) 
       Solomon Muto  enters  Pharaoh Atem 's Ancient Tomb     
 During his younger years [1] ,  Solomon Muto  visited the Valley of the Kings and found the  Millennium Puzzle  in the " Tomb of the Nameless Pharaoh ", which was actually the tomb of  Pharaoh Atem . Later on, the Solomon give the Puzzle to his grandson  Yugi Muto .
 At the time of Solomon's visit in the 1960s, over 60 ancient tombs had been discovered in this valley [1] , but no one had dared enter the inner chambers of  Pharaoh Atem 's tomb. The one person that did and survived, was a villager known by Solomon's guides. He was driven mad and repeated the same phrase over and over: "The Shadow Game" (Game of Darkness,  Yami No Game  in Japanese).
 
 Yoshimori and Kanekura's expedition (1990s) 
 The archaeologist,  Yoshimori , was part of an exhibition sponsored by the museum curator,  Kanekura . They found a tomb from the New Kingdom Era (1550-1077 BC). The treasures and mummy were taken and put on display in the museum. However Kanekura allegedly stole treasures which he sold for his own profit. [2] 
 Shadi , a guardian of the valley, sought to punish Kanekura and Yoshimori for defiling the territory of the Gods. He traveled to Japan, where he performed a  Weighing of the Heart   Shadow Game  on Kanekura, killing him in the process. [2]  Shadi also intended to kill Yoshimori, but used him to lure  Dark Yugi  into a game to test him. [3]

 The Tomb of the Nameless Pharaoh 
 Main article:  Tomb of the Nameless Pharaoh 
 Before reaching the end of  Pharaoh Atem 's Tomb and the  Millennium Puzzle ,  Solomon Muto  and his guides had to go through a variety of trapped rooms as the ancient treasure was well defended. Each room was treated like a "game", with the ultimate sacrifice awaiting those who lost: death.
 
 The Tomb of King Aknamkanon 
       Thief King Bakura  raiding the tomb of King  Aknamkanon     
 It is fair to assume that as all other Pharaohs, King  Aknamkanon  also had a tomb in the  Valley of the Kings  waiting for him when he died. The tomb was then raided by  Thief King Bakura  during the  Dawn of the Duel  story arc [4] . 
 Before he stormed the Royal Palace to confront  Pharaoh Atem , Bakura stole several treasures from King  Aknamkanon 's tomb, including Aknamkanon's sarcophagus and his  DiaDhank . The DiaDhank then permitted Bakura to Summon any monster from Aknamkanon's  Monster Shrine [5] .
