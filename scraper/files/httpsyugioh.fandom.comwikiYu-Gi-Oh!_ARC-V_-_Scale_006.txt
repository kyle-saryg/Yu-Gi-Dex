 Genesis Omega Dragon! 
 
 "Feeling Alive!!"  is the sixth chapter of the  Yu-Gi-Oh! ARC-V  manga .
 This chapter was first printed in Japanese in the March 2016 issue of  V Jump , released on January 21, 2015, and in English in the January 25, 2016 issue of  Weekly Shonen Jump .
 When it seemed  Shun  was on the verge of defeat, he Summons his ace monster and corners  Yuya , who stands against it with his " Odd-Eyes " monsters.
 
 Summary 
   This summary is currently incomplete. 
 Yuya  is bit unnerved by  Shun 's sadomasochistic ideology of how one best enjoys a Duel. But even if Shun gives off a scary vibe, Yuya sees some truth in his opponent's words but considers being a  Dueltainer  to cheer up others to be as equally effective. Shun takes offense to Yuya's counterargument, using his " Raidraptor - Napalm Dragonius " with another he summoned to  Xyz Summon  " Raidraptor - Blade Burner Falcon " whose effect embodies his ideals. As Yuya finds his monsters being taken out,  Yuzu 's attempt to save her  father  causes the branch he is tied to snap. Luckily, though furious that they forced him to stall his turn, Shun saves the Hiiragis from certain death to Yuya's relief. When Yuya's turn comes, he  Pendulum Summons  " Odd-Eyes Phantom Dragon " back from his  Extra Deck  and uses " Odd-Eyes Persona Dragon 's" effect to have the dragons switch places to avoid Shun's  Sky Meteor . Yuya then uses OddEyes Persona Dragon's effect to negate Blade Burner Falcon before destroying it and winning the duel.
 Furious over his lost and being outwitted, Shun sees Yuya's smiling face and relents while accepting his fate as he falls to his death once his Raidraptor fully dissolved. But Yuya saves Shun's life, the youth asking Shun if he enjoyed their duel. As Yuya spirits Yuzu and her father off when they attempt to a quick and embarrassing sales pitch for  Syu Zo Duel School  targeted at the LC Duelist, Shun seems to have had a change of heart about Yuya and intends to return the favor someday. Back at the Duel School, after Yuzu tells her father that she got the Phantom as an member of their facility, they find Yuya in the middle of an argument with  Yuto  over the Hiiragis' promotional pitch. While the Hiiragis assume he might be suffering from some sort of Dissociative Identity Disorder to have two personalities having a heated discussion, Yuya admits that  he   actually   has   four .
 
 Featured Duel: Yuya Sakaki vs. Shun Kurosaki 
 Duel continues from the previous Scale . 
 Turn 3: Shun 
 Yuya  attempts to catch an  Action Card , but  Shun  intercepts him using " Raidraptor - Napalm Dragonius " and catches the Action Card himself. Shun  Normal Summons  a second copy of "Napalm Dragonius" and Overlays his two  Level  4  monsters  to  Xyz Summon  " Raidraptor - Blade Burner Falcon " (1000/1000). As Shun has 3000 or more LP less than Yuya, the effect of "Blade Burner Falcon" increases its  ATK  by 3000 ("Blade Burner Falcon": 1000 → 4000 ATK). He  attacks  and  destroys  " Odd-Eyes Phantom Dragon " with "Blade Burner Falcon" (Yuya: 3100 → 1600 LP), with "Phantom Dragon" going to Yuya's  Extra Deck . Since it destroyed a monster  by battle , the  effect  of "Blade Burner Falcon"  activates , allowing Shun to destroy Yuya's " Enter-Mate Uni " and " Enter-Mate Corn ". Next, Shun activates the Action Card " Second Attack " from his  hand , allowing "Blade Burner Falcon" to attack twice. "Blade Burner Falcon" attacks Yuya  directly , but Yuya activates the effect of "Uni" in his  Graveyard , banishing her alongside "Corn" in order to reduce the  battle damage  by their total  DEF  (Yuya: 1600 → 100 LP).
 Turn 4: Yuya 
Yuya  Pendulum Summons  "Odd-Eyes Phantom Dragon" from his Extra Deck. Shun catches an Action Card, " Sky Meteor ", and activates it, attempting to  banish  "Phantom Dragon", but Yuya activates the Pendulum Effect of " Odd-Eyes Persona Dragon ", Special Summoning it (1200/2400) and placing "Phantom Dragon" ( PS : 4) in his right  Pendulum Zone , thus causing "Sky Meteor" to miss its  target . Yuya then activates the effect of "Persona Dragon",  negating  the effect of "Blade Burner Falcon" ("Blade Burner Falcon": 4000 → 1000 ATK). "Persona Dragon" attacks and destroys "Blade Burner Falcon" (Shun: 100 → 0 LP).
