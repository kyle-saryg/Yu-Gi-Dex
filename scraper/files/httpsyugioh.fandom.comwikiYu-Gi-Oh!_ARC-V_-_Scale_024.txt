 Adam and Eve! 
 
 "The Reason They're After Us!"  is the twenty-fourth chapter of the  Yu-Gi-Oh! ARC-V  manga .
 This chapter was first printed in Japanese in the September 2017 issue of  V Jump , released on July 21, 2017, and in English in the July 24, 2017 issue of  Weekly Shonen Jump .
 Yuya  and  Reiji  slowly get closer to learning the truth behind  Eve  and the  G.O.D.  card, as her assassins go after them - this time,  Isaac , who confronts Reiji in a  Duel  between scientists.
 
 Summary 
 Having won the duel, the force of the attack knocking  Ren  off his Duel Runner,  Yuya  is shocked to find his opponent's body dissolve as a side effect of repeated time travel as an ageless being. Ren reveals that the  Adam Factor  is the scattered soul of Adam, a great scientist who was  Eve 's lover before his being was splintered by the power of  Genesis Omega Dragon . Ren warns Yuya that the G.O.D card will influence people, both directly and indirectly, to gain the power to manipulate space and time once both the Adam and  Eve Factors  are in its possession. Ren sinks into a portal while musing if Yuya has the will to defy the G.O.D. card and forge his own destiny. With  Yuzu  confused of what just occurred, the youth feeling the same from seeing his concealed memories, Yuya assures her that things will make sense eventually.
 The two are then alerted to a call by  Reiji  from a gigantic space station that is a testing center for  Solid Vision . It was then that Reiji is confronted by  Isaac  who explains that the Adam Factor limits the G.O.D. card's power and can only be taken if the current holder loses against one who seeks it. Isaac adds that Adam was the one who discovered Genesis Omega Dragon and devised the Solid Vision technology, explaining that Yusho and Leo only acted on the G.O.D. card's will to be brought into their time. Reiji refuses to accept that truth as he challenges Isaac despite being warned of the consequences should he lose.
