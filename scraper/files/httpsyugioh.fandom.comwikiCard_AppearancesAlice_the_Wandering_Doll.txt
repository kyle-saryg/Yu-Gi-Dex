The effect of " Cursed Dollhouse " then activates, allowing Alice to Special Summon " Doll Part Blue " from her Deck. Later "Doll Part Blue" attacks this card. The attack fails, but this card' second effect activates, inflicting 500 damage to Alice and switching control of this card to Alice. Later " Rallis the Star Bird " attacks this card.
