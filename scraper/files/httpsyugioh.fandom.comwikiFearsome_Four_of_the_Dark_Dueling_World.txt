 Story 
 The "Fearsome Four" were originally a gang of underworld Dueling criminals working under  Mr. Heartland . All of them except for Mr. Heartland were recruited as  Barians  by  Vector  to aid the former. Mr. Heartland eventually joined them after falling through a portal and ending up in the  Barian Sea . 
 Later in the series, Heartland was eventually revived by  Vector  using the power of  Don Thousand , though his form was that of a fly. Later on, Vector restored Heartland into his normal human form and summoned the other members of the Fearsome Four to accompany him in his journey to take the "Numbers" from  Yuma Tsukumo ,  Reginald Kastle  and  Kite Tenjo .
 
 Abilities 
 Being Barians, the Fearsome Four have superhuman abilities such as teleporting and taking into alternative forms that give them unique abilities, such as  Erazor  being capable of stealing memories,  Chironex  capable of becoming living water and poisoning others and  Scritch  being able to turn into a mosquito at will. They have also shown the ability to alter a Duel by using a  Crest  akin to that of  Don Thousand's Emblem  to halve the opponent's Life Points and add it to their own at the very beginning of the Duel, effectively cheating.
 
 Fearsome Four 
 Each member has an alternate form based on different invertebrates. These are all often considered pests by humans, with the reasons for this ranging from being plain annoying to carrying deadly diseases.
 Each member also carries a "Number" ranging from 1 to 4 given to them by Vector. These were, however,  fake  "Numbers", ultimately self-destructing along with Mr. Heartland when all of the Fearsome Four were defeated. The numbering of these fake "Numbers" carried several obvious puns with them, such as "Number 4: Stealth Kragen" being used by Chironix against  Quattro , which the latter pointed out when it was summoned.

 Trivia 
 Chironex  is the only member whose alternate form is not an insect. [2] 
 is also the only member who used the Barian Emblem against his opponents by asking first and having them agree to it instead of cheating against their will. 
 They are the only Barian-related characters who do not use any form of  Rank-Up .
