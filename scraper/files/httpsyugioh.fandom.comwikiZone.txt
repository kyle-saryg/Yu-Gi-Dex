 A  zone  (Japanese: ゾーン  Zōn ) is a space for a card(s) on the  Playmat [Notes 1] . Each side of the player features 16 zones, divided into 5  columns  of 2 zones each, and 2 end columns of 2 zones each.
 
 Descriptions 
 The top left zone is the  Field Zone , where the  player 's  Field Spell Cards  are played. The bottom zone is the  Extra Deck Zone , where the player's  Extra Deck  is placed.
 The top right zone is the  Graveyard Zone , where the player's  Graveyard  is placed. The bottom is the  Deck Zone , where the player's  Main Deck  is placed.
 The upper row of five central zones are  Main Monster Zones , where  Monster Cards  are played; the lower row of five central zones are  Spell & Trap Zones , where  Spell  and  Trap Cards  are played. The leftmost and rightmost is also used as the  Pendulum Zones .
 Between each player's field on the 2nd and 4th columns are the 2  Extra Monster Zones . These Zones are exclusively used for playing monster from the Extra Deck.
 A pile of where  banished  cards are placed outside the zones, at the participating players' agreement. In video games, and general real-life use, it is typically located to the right of the Graveyard Zone.
 Each vertical line of Zones stretching from one player's Spell & Trap Zone to their opponent's constitutes a  column ; there are five columns on the field.
 
 Master Rule 3 
 There were middle zones of the left and rightmost columns, serving as the player's two  Pendulum Zones , which had been introduced in  Starter Deck 2014 . The blue Pendulum Zone was on the left and the red Pendulum Zone was on the right, where the player's  Pendulum Monsters  were played as  Spell Cards .
