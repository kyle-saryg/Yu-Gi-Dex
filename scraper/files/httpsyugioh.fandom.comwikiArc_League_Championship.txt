 Additionally, according to Declan, the upcoming Battle Royal Junior Youth finals has an alternative motive as well. That is to stop the upcoming Fusion Dimension invasion. In addition, the Top 8 of the Senior finals were more specifically deployed to Duel  Duel Academy  Duelists.
 
 Requirements 
 To qualify for the championship, a  Duelist  must either have:
 
 Participated in at least fifty official Duels in a year, with a win rate of at least 60%.

 Tournament Format 
 For the start of the tournament, Duelists were required to put their tournament ID's into their  Duel Disk . A computer would then match that registered Duelist to another opponent. These two Duelists would have a match and the victor would advance to the next round.
 In the first round, there were 32 matches for the Junior Youth division. In the second round, there are supposed to be 16 matches for the Junior Youth Division. However, one was defaulted after  Dipper  was sealed into a card by  Celina .
 
 Final 16 of Junior Youth 
         
         
         
           
 The final 16 Duelists are engaged in a  Battle Royal  around  Paradise City  using  Quartet of Quandry  as the Action Field. The Duelists will also be able to find  Pendulum Monsters  around the city to assist them in their Duels. Similar to  Duelist Kingdom  and  Battle City , Duelists must find at least  two Pendulum Monster Cards  to Duel against other opponents and wager them. Duelists participate in individual Duels, which can merge into Tag Duels. If a Duelist forcibly joins an already-existing Duel, they receive a 2000 damage penalty for intrusion. The winner will take the losing opponent's Pendulum Monster Cards and move on to the next opponent. The top 8 Duelists with the most Pendulum Monster Cards will move onto the next round. The Battle Royal will last for 24 hours. The Battle Royal began at midday with all Duelists leaving the stadium to Duel.
 
 Cancellation 
 The surviving participants of the Junior Youth Division were  Nagi ,  Taka ,  Moon Shadow ,  Dennis McField ,  Gong Strong ,  Yuya Sakaki ,  Shay Obsidian  and  Zuzu Boyle . Rather than playing the Battle Royal as expected, they instead fended off an invasion of  Standard Dimension  by the  Fusion Dimension  that sealed the other eight participants into cards.  Sora  sealed  Sun Shadow ,  Yuri  sealed  Halil  and  Olga , while the  Obelisk Force  sealed  Ashley ,  Carl ,  Bram ,  Reed Pepper  and  Trout . Nagi and Taka Dueled  Yugo , but were defeated by him off-screen. Additionally, while Zuzu survived, she was transported with Yugo to the  Synchro Dimension  due to  her bracelet  and initially assumed by the other contestants to have been sealed in a card as well.
 After the Battle Royal ended, Henrietta and Declan officially canceled the Arc League Championship to reveal to the public the existence of the  Fusion Dimension  invaders as well as the  Lancers .
 
 Recreation 
 When the  Four Dimensions  were seperated again,  Declan  sent out invitations to  Yuya ,  Gong ,  Sylvio , and  Moon Shadow  to participate in the Arc League Championship, though he kept Moon Shadow's identity and place in the tournament a secret bar only that there was a fourth Duelist participating. The tournament started with the four Duelists Dueling in a  Battle Royal  within  Paradise City , in an attempt to reawaken the  Lancers  memories and have Yuya's Duel make  Riley , who was turned into a baby after sealing  Z-ARC , smile again. 
 Yuya eventually won, and was about to be promoted from Junior Youth to Senior, but Declan intervened. He explained that the Battle Royal was supposed to be a continuation of the Arc League Championship that had been interrupted by  Duel Academy 's attack. Declan thus sent Yuya to defeat the Duelists who had still remained after the attack and that he had chosen as Lancers, explaining that only one of them could advance to the Senior class. After doing so, Yuya had one last duel against Declan to become a pro duelist, which he eventually won.
