For the effect with the same name, see  Point-to-Point Transfer .      
 A  One Turn Kill  (OTK) (Japanese:  ＯＴＫ   Wantānkiru ) is achieved when a player wins a  Duel  in the space of a single  turn .
 In one turn, all of the opponent's  Life Points , which is normally assumed to be no less than 8000, must be depleted, or an alternate  victory condition  must be fulfilled. This is usually done when the player has the appropriate cards in their  hand / Graveyard  and has  control  over the Duel.
 Significant or reliable OTKs generally consist of 4 or fewer cards, do not require the opponent to have particular cards or rely on indefinite chance, such as the effect of " Snipe Hunter ".
 Traditional  and  Advanced Formats  will have very different OTK styles, owing to the allowable  card pools . The Advanced Format banlist is updated every six months to reduce the viability of OTKs.
 A One Turn Kill that is pulled off during the Duel's first turn is referred to as a  First Turn Kill .

 OTKs in Media 
 OTKs are rare in Yu-Gi-Oh! media, especially prior to Yu-Gi-Oh! ZEXAL, but are not non-existent. In many cases, an OTK in the anime is shown either to show off the strength of a powerful Duelist, or for the winner to have a come-from-behind victory. Since Duelists usually start with 4000 Life Points in the anime, an OTK is declared when all 4000 are depleted in one turn. Some Duelists have OTKed their opponents in the anime, including:
