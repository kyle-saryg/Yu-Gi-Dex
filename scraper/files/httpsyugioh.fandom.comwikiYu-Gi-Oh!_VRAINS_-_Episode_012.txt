 Featured Duel: Playmaker vs. Varis 
 Duel continues from the previous episode . 
 Turn 7: Varis 
Playmaker activates the effect of " Firewall Dragon " to target  monsters  on the field or in either player's  GY  equal to the number of monsters  co-linked  with it and  return  them to the hand. Playmaker  targets  " Magnarokket Dragon " as " Borreload Dragon " cannot be targeted. As a  Link Monster 's effect is activated targeting "Magnarokket", Varis activates its effect, destroying it, and sending a monster on the field to the GY. Varis tries to send "Firewall Dragon" to the GY, but Playmaker activates the effect of " Cynet Refresh " in his GY,  banishing  it to make  Cyberse  Link Monsters he controls be  unaffected  by card effects until the end of this turn. As "Magnarokket" was sent to the GY this turn, Varis activates its effect,  Special Summoning  a " rokket " monster from his  Deck . Varis Special Summons " Anesthrokket Dragon " (0/2200 → 300/2500) in  Defense Position .
 Turn 8: Playmaker 
Playmaker  draws  and subsequently activates the  Continuous Spell Card  " Battle Buffer ",  negating  the effects of a number of monsters Varis controls up to the number of monsters co-linked with each other Playmaker controls. After a Cyberse Link Monster battles, Playmaker can place a " Battle Buffer Counter " on "Battle Buffer", increasing the ATK of all Cyberse Link Monsters he controls by 700 for each. He chooses to negate the effects of "Magnarokket" and "Anesthrokket". 
 "Firewall Dragon" attacks "Borreload Dragon". Playmaker activates the effect of "Encode Talker", as "Firewall Dragon" at its bottom Link Point is battling an opponent's monster with higher  ATK , preventing the attacking monster from being destroyed by battle and reducing the  battle damage  to 0. After the battle, either "Encode Talker" or a monster at its Link Point gains ATK equal to "Borreload Dragon" until the end of the turn. Playmaker chooses "Firewall Dragon"("Firewall Dragon": 2800 → 5800 ATK). The effect of "Battle Buffer" activates, causing it to gain a "Battle Buffer Counter" ("Battle Buffer": 0 → 1 Battle Buffer Counter) ("Firewall Dragon": 5800 → 6500; "Encode Talker": 2600 → 3300). "Encode Talker" attacks "Borreload Dragon". Varis activates the effect of "Borreload Dragon", decreasing the ATK and DEF of a monster on the field by 500. Varis targets "Encode Talker" ("Encode Talker": 3300 → 2800 ATK). The attack continues and "Encode Talker" is destroyed (Playmaker: 600 → 400  LP ). "Battle Buffer" gains a "Battle Buffer Counter" ("Battle Buffer": 1 → 2 Battle Buffer Counters; "Firewall Dragon": 6500 → 7200).
 As Playmaker does not control a monster in the  Extra Monster Zone , he activates the effect of " Recoded Alive " in his GY, banishing it to Special Summon one of his banished " Code Talker " monsters. Playmaker Special Summons " Decode Talker " (2300/LINK-3/↙↑↘), pointing it to "Borreload Dragon". "Decode Talker" gains 500 ATK for each monster it points to ("Decode Talker": 2300 → 2800). The effect of " Cynet Universe " increases the ATK of Link Monsters by 300, while "Battle Buffer" also increases the ATK of "Decode Talker" by 700 for each "Battle Buffer Counter" on it ("Decode Talker": 2800 → 4500 ATK). "Decode Talker" attacks "Borreload Dragon". Varis activates his  face-down  " Borrel Cooling ", Tributing a Level 3 or lower monster to equip a "Borrel" monster with it. The equipped monster gains an effect that lets Varis target a monster he controls to prevent it from being destroyed once per turn. Varis Tributes "Anesthrokket" and equips "Cooling" to "Borreload Dragon". Varis activates the effect of "Borreload" that was granted by "Cooling" to prevent "Magnarokket" from being destroyed. As a Link Monster's effect that targeted "Magnarokket" was activated, Varis activates its effect, destroying it, and sending a monster on the field to the GY. Varis sends "Decode Talker" to the GY.
 Playmaker activates the effect of " Parallel Port Armor " in his GY, banishing it and two Link Monsters from his GY to let a Link Monster he controls attack twice during this turn's Battle Phase. Playmaker banishes "Decode Talker" and "Encode Talker" and targets "Firewall Dragon". "Firewall Dragon" attacks "Borreload Dragon" (Varis: 4000 → 0 LP). [Notes 1]
