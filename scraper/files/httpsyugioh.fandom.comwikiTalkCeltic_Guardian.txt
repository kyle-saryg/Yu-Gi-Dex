Some one told me that this was Yami Yu-Gi's favorite card and Dark Magician is only Yu-Gi Muto's. Is that true?-- Blueyeyesawesomedragon  15:11, 15 March 2009 (UTC)
 
 As far as I know Dark Magician is little Yugi's and it was never said if Yami Yugi had a favorite card.  Osmiu Map  -  You have no new messages.  15:33, 15 March 2009 (UTC)
