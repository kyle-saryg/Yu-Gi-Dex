 Biography 
 This oversized Cup Ramen is used by  Jack Atlas  in an attempt to lure and capture  Lazar . Jack and the rest of  Team 5D's  put on a  Red Demon's Noodle  promotion. Since he lost a game of  jyanken ,  Crow Hogan  was forced to dress up as Cup Ramen Man for the event. If someone could defeat him in a Duel, they were said to get a free year's supple of Red Demon's Noodle. Crow defeated a number of opponents until Lazar arrived to challenge him. Crow removed the giant cup and trapped Lazar inside it. However, Lazar threw a smoke bomb and made his escape, but not before Yusei threw a tracer on him. [2] 
 After Lazar told Team 5D's and  Sherry LeBlanc  what he knew about  Iliaster , he took them to the  Accel Simulator  at  Game Paradise . The players were given 3 credits and would lose 1 for every failed attempt. By clearing two Duel Puzzles, they would be able to access hidden data, including the identity of a company related to Iliaster. They faced Cup Ramen Man in the puzzles. Cup Ramen Man teased the players as they failed the puzzles. Lazar tried and failed to pass the first puzzle, but Akiza cleared it. Jack tried and failed to pass the second puzzle. With 1 credit left, Yusei took over and cleared it. Cup Ramen Man fell from his  Duel Runner  yelling "This should have ended in China!". [1]
