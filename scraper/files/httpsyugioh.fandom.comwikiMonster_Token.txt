 Mechanics 
 Token Monsters are always  Normal Monsters  and never have effects. Thus, they qualify for Normal Monster  support  and  non-Effect Monster  support.
 Some Token Monsters have effects applied to them by the cards that Summon them, but these are not the effects of the Token Monsters themselves, so these "effects" cannot be  negated  by cards like " Skill Drain ". 
 Some Normal Monster support may specifically exclude Tokens, such as " Order to Charge ". 
 Tokens can only exist  face-up  on the  field . 
 Token Monsters cannot be  face-down . Thus, they cannot be  targeted  by, and are unaffected by, effects that  flip  cards face-down (such as " Book of Moon " and " Swords of Concealing Light ").
 If an  Attack Position  Token Monster would be affected by a card that would change it to face-down  Defense Position , such as " Swords of Concealing Light ", the Token Monster's  battle position  is not changed at all. 
 Token Monsters cannot be banished face-down. They can't be targeted, and are unaffected, by card effects that would do so. 
 The original  ATK ,  DEF ,  Level , Name,  Type  and  Attribute  of a Token is stated on the card that Summons them. 
 If a Token Monster would  leave the field  (i.e. if it would be returned to the  hand  or  Main Deck , sent to  GY , or  banished ), it simply disappears.
 Token Monsters can be successfully  Tributed ,  destroyed , or  banished ; however, because they simply leave the field, they are not treated as being successfully moved to the specified zone. 
 Token Monsters can be used to pay  costs , as long as the cost does not specify a destination.
 Token Monsters can be  Tributed  for  Tribute  or  Ritual Summon , or for the Special Summon of cards like " Destiny HERO - Plasma ". 
 They cannot be  sent  to the  Graveyard  as a cost (such as for the Special Summon of " Arcana Force EX - The Dark Ruler "). 
 Banishing  does not specify a destination, so a Token can be  banished  for a cost (such as for the  Special Summon  of " Unibird "). 
 Token Monsters can be used as  Fusion ,  Synchro , or  Link Materials . 
 Tokens cannot be used as  Xyz Materials , because Xyz Materials are  attached  to the  Xyz Monster  and attached Xyz Materials are not considered to be on the field. 
 Tokens can be the  target  of and are affected by card effects that cause them to  leave the field , even if they specify a destination, such as " Number 50: Blackship of Corn " and " Compulsory Evacuation Device ".
 Tokens cannot be  targeted  by the effect of a card that would attach them to an  Xyz Monster , such as " Number 101: Silent Honor ARK ". 
 A Token Monster can be treated as an  Equip Card  by a card like " The Grand Jupiter "
 If so, Token Monsters cannot be Special Summoned from the  Spell & Trap Zone . 
 The  owner  of a Token Monster is the player who  Special Summoned  it.
 " Owner's Seal " will change control of  Ojama Tokens  Special Summoned by the effect of " Ojama Trio " to the player who activated "Ojama Trio".
 " Rose Tokens " are the exception to this, instead being owned by the player who controls the monster whose Summon caused the "Rose Token" to be Summoned (rather than the player who Summoned the "Rose Token"). (Example: Player A Normal Summons a monster, and trigger the effect of "Black Garden", Special Summoning "Rose Token". This "Rose Token" is owned by Player A.) [2] [3] 
 Usage in Real Life 
 During a Duel, duelists may keep Token cards in a separate pile outside of the game mat or in the deck case.
 A Monster Token can be represented by a coin (Heads is treated as  Attack Position  and Tails is treated as  Defense Position ), a die, or other such acceptable markers. Fan-made cards are often used as markers in Tournament Duels.
 
 Card Layouts 
 Official Token cards are grey. 
 Most Token cards from  Series 8  onward that correspond to specific Monster Tokens have their own names printed out, and sometimes also include  ATK / DEF . [Notes 2] 
 Card text 
 Prior to  Series 8  in the  OCG  and  Series 9  in the  TCG , all Token cards share the same card text (as listed in the following table) and name ( Token ). From these series onward in the respective games, some Token cards have different names or card text.

 In Video Games 
         Example of  Kuriboh Token  from  Yu-Gi-Oh! Power of Chaos: Joey the Passion  and  Yu-Gi-Oh! Power of Chaos: Kaiba the Revenge  Video Game Series     In  Yu-Gi-Oh! Power of Chaos: Joey the Passion  and  Yu-Gi-Oh! Power of Chaos: Kaiba the Revenge , Token cards are yellow like  Normal Monsters , while their artwork is a recolored TCG artwork of " Spellbinding Circle " (colors are distinguished by their names and attributes).
 Trivia 
 The first Token that did not correspond to a specific Monster Token was the " National Championship 2009 Token ", which in 2009 was given to participants of United States and Canada's National Championships and participants of the European and South American Continental Championships.
