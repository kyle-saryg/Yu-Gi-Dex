 Summary 
 Before the Duel 
         Yusei  meets-up with  Team 5D's  and  Sherry .     
 The door to the center  Planetary Gear  opens in front of  Luna ,  Leo ,  Akiza ,  Jack ,  Crow  and  Sherry , so they deduce that  Yusei  must have stopped the third gear. Just then Yusei arrives on his  Duel Runner  and everyone rushes over to him to greet him. Yusei asks if everyone is okay and Leo starts to show-off his  Mark of the Dragon . Jack and Luna are both impressed with how well Leo dueled with them against  Aporia . Yusei congratulates Leo and turns to Sherry, who tells him that she has decided to fight alongside them.
 Akiza asks what happened to "the guy with the sunglasses", Vizor. Yusei hangs his head and says that that man is no longer here, he protected the Planetary Gear and his name was  Bruno . The rest of  Team 5D's  are all surprised to hear this and ask why Bruno would do such a thing. Yusei explains that Bruno's real name was Antinomy and just like Aporia, he was sent by  Z-one  to change the future. Luna asks if this means Bruno was their enemy, but Yusei insists that that isn't true. He admits that Bruno was sent by Z-one, but says that the emotions Bruno displayed while fighting alongside them were real and that is why Bruno taught Yusei how to fight against him. He tells them of the new power they can use to fight Z-one,  Delta Accel Synchro Summon  and how Bruno gave his life in order to save Yusei. Yusei says that Bruno left the future in their hands as everyone takes a moment to mourn his death.
 
         The spiral stairway.     
 Crow says that it was unforgivable of Z-one to use Bruno as a shield from the Planetary Gear and Jack asks Sherry is she knows where Z-one is located. The group mount their Duel Runners and head to Z-one to avenge Bruno. Z-one watches Team 5D's and says that they have finally come.
 
         The  Old Ener-D .     
 Team 5D's and Sherry drive up a long spiral stairway, filled with gears. Leo and Luna wonder what this place is and how long it goes on for. Crow spots an  Old Ener-D  device, which leads them to deduce that the support gear is running on Old Ener-D. Yusei bows his head and thinks his fate isn't over yet.
 The group finally reach the top of the staircase, which takes them to a scrapyard. They hear Z-one's voice welcoming them, so Yusei leads the others in the direction of the voice. They pass a number of  Duel Monsters  tablets on the way and finally arrive at a heap of scrap, with Z-one perched on top. Everyone dismounts their Duel Runners and rush over. Leo is surprised to see that a part of Z-one resembles  Yusei Go .
 
         Team 5D's and Sherry meet  Z-one .     
 Z-one says that he has witnessed all of their Duels and as one would expect from Team 5D's, they have all fought admirably. He addresses Sherry's decision to join them, but before he can comment, Sherry objects and says that the past cannot be changed and she is only going to live for the future. Jack adds that for that future to come, Z-one needs to disappear. Crow refuses to let Z-one destroy  New Domino City  and Yusei says that he has made a promise to Bruno to save the future. Z-one says that he means Antinomy and asks what exactly they are capable of. Z-one explains that the Synchro Summons they created led the world to destruction in the first place.
 Z-one explains that had Synchro Summoning not existed in the first place, the Ener-D, that  Yusei's father  created would not have gone berserk and humanity would not have met their downfall. Ener-D and Synchro Summoning carry nothing but a future of destruction and despair with them, Z-one says, so in order to change this future, Z-one says that he orchestrated  Zero Reverse  in order to eliminate Ener-D. He then sent  Paradox  as a trial to eliminate the root source of  Duel Monsters . Yusei remembers  his encounter with Paradox , having not known before that he was also sent by Z-one. Presently, he created Aporia and Antinomy to see to the completion of his plan, which entails dropping the  Divine Temple  onto New Domino City, destroying the city and all of the Ener-D.
 
         Aporia  appears.     
 Yusei gets mad over Bruno having his memories erased and dying for that purpose and vows to stop the Divine Temple. Z-one then offers Yusei a chance to Duel him and explains that the support gear operating the Divine Temple is linked to him. Unless he is defeated in a duel, the gear will not stop. Yusei says that that is just what he wanted and starts to run up to Z-one. However Aporia appears and tells him to stop.
 Aporia is damaged from his Duel with Jack, Leo and Luna, who are all surprised to see he is still alive. He turns to Z-one and says that he shall be Z-one's opponent. Akiza asks why Aporia is fighting Z-one and Aporia answers that living on in the ruined future is part of his mission. Jack asks what he means by "mission" and he explains that he found an answer in his Duel with Jack, Leo and Luna; The answer to why he continued to live, despite suffering so much despair. He reflects on losing his  mother ,  father  and  lover , being alone and how he continued to move forward after those events. He explains that no matter how much despair he felt, he never lost his hope. Because of this hope, he was able to make it this far and dueled all them many times until he realized this. He explains that he wants to duel Z-one, because he wants Z-one to remember the hope he once held for Yusei and his friends. Team 5D's are surprised to hear that Z-one once had hope for them.
 Aporia reminds Z-one that he sent him to complete the  Grand Design  and allow the  Divine Temple  to appear and in order to complete the Grand Design, he also sent Antinomy to stimulate the evolution of Team 5D's and asks why Z-one had to erase Antinomy's memories. He believes that that only hindered the plan and Z-one also helped them in stopping the Ark Cradle. He asks if that evolution is what he was hoping for from the start. Aporia believes that there is a good chance that Team 5D's can stop the evolution that destroyed mankind and because of that Z-one sent Antinomy to Yusei and his friends, leaving them the little remaining possibility that humanity had left and the last piece of hope. If that is true, he asks why Z-one tried to stop the evolution and try to kill them after leaving the future with them.
 Z-one replies that this hope that Aporia speaks of those not exist in the present. Aporia argues that Z-one once had a great deal of hope and he wants him to remember it. Aporia stumbles back, as he still suffers damage from his last Duel, but he manages to whip out his  Duel Disk  and challenges Z-one to a Duel. Leo worries that Aporia's current condition could be a problem. However having witnessed Leo's hope, Aporia explains that he came to understand that bond that Team 5D's share is the same hope he had been searching for and because he has that hope, he shall fight. Leo objects, but Jack says to let him do it, as this is Aporia's way of deciding what is right and wrong.
 Z-one asks why Aporia insists on fighting him, but seeing no choice, he says that he shall begin by burying Aporia and agrees to Duel. 
 A device shoots up from inside the scrap heap, causing Team 5D's and Sherry to be thrown back. The device then separates into three components. Two of them float next to Z-one as arms and the third floats just in front of him. The  Duel Monsters  tablets in the scrapyard then fly towards the third device. The stone shatters from around them, making them large, but otherwise regular cards. The cards stack up in the device, ready for Z-one to use as his Deck. Aporia tells Team 5D's to watch closely and see Z-one's strength.
 
 The device emerges from the scrap. The device splits into three components. The components join with Z-one. 
 The Duel 
 Aporia goes first. He  Normal Summons  " Grand Core " and then destroys it with " Chaos Bloom ". Since "Grand Core" was destroyed by a  card effect , its effect  Special Summons  " Meklord Emperor Granel ", " Granel Top ", " Granel Attack ", " Granel Guard " and " Granel Carrier " from his Deck. The five components then combine into "Meklord Emperor Granel". Its  ATK  becomes equal to his  Life Points , making it 4000. Leo, Luna and Crow are surprised to see "Meklord Emperor Granel" Summoned with 4000  ATK  on Aporia's first turn. However Yusei is curious about it being used from the beginning and wonders if Z-one is really a powerful opponent. Aporia  Sets  one card in his  Spell & Trap Card Zone  and ends his turn.
 Seeing "Meklord Emperor Granel" Summoned, Z-one says that Aporia is fully aware of his power and asks if he honestly thinks that will be enough to defeat him. Leo is surprised to hear Z-one talking about Granel as if it was any other card and Akiza wonders what monsters Z-one is about to Summon.
 Z-one begins his turn and Normal Summons " Time Angel ". Luna and Leo are surprised to see him using a monster with 0 ATK against "Granel". Z-one has "Time Angel"  attack  "Meklord Emperor Granel". Crow points out that this could result in 4000  Battle Damage , which would cause Z-one to lose instantly. "Time Angel" gets destroyed, but Z-one activates the  Trap Card  " Foolish Decision " from his  hand . Jack is surprised to see a Trap Card being used from the hand and Sherry points out that it's also unconditional. "Foolish Decision" reduces the damage to 0 and since "Time Angel" was  destroyed by battle , all monsters on the field are returned to their owners  hands . "Granel" splits back into five components and returns to Aporia's hand. With "Grand Core" gone, Yusei comments that it will take Aporia five turns to reassemble it, making it effectively sealed off.
 
         Aporia gets blasted back.     
 Z-one activates another Trap Card from his hand, " Magician's Adage ", inflicting 300 damage to Aporia for every card returned to his hand. Aporia is hit by a blast and violently thrown back as his Life Points drop to 2500. Leo runs over to help, but Aporia insists that he is fine and can still fight. Aporia walks back to his position and Z-one Sets a card in his Spell & Trap Card Zone, ending his turn.
 
         The  attack  from " Meklord Emperor Wisel " is  negated .     
 Aporia begins his turn. He Summons " Wise Core " and activates " Chaos Blast ", sending three cards from the top of his Deck to the Graveyard and destroying "Wise Core". Since "Wise Core" was destroyed by a card effect, he Special Summons " Meklord Emperor Wisel ", " Wisel Top ", " Wisel Attack ", " Wisel Guard " and " Wisel Carrier " from his Deck. The five of them combine and form "Meklord Emperor Wisel". Aporia attacks Z-one  directly  with "Meklord Emperor Wisel". Leo celebrates that it's going to work, but Yusei thinks otherwise. Z-one activates another Trap Card from his hand, " Empress's Staff ". Since he  controls  no  monsters , it negates the attack, ends the  Battle Phase  and inflicts 500 damage to Aporia. Aporia is struck by electricity and his Life Points drop to 2000.
 Aporia falls forward, landing flat on the ground. Z-one asks Aporia to stop and says that there is no hope for the future, only despair and Aporia should know that more than anyone. He says that going further will only result in despair and Aporia cannot defeat him. However Aporia stands up and insists that they continue. He Sets a card in his Spell & Trap Card Zone and ends his turn.
 
         Z-one activates " Nonexistence ".     
 Seeing that Aporia really wants to do this, Z-one concludes that it cannot be avoided and offers to remind Aporia what true despair feels like. Z-one begins his turn and activates his  face-down   Continuous Trap Card  " Nonexistence ". Provided he controls no monsters, this allows him to Summon  Level  10 or higher monsters without  Releasing  anything, but their ATK will be reduced to 0. He then proceeds to Summon " Metaion, the Timelord ". Aporia declares that that is Z-one's ace monster. With only 0 ATK, Yusei wonders what kind of effect it has.
 
         " Metaion, the Timelord ".     
 Z-one attacks "Meklord Emperor Wisel" with "Metaion, the Timelord". "Wisel" has more attack, but the effect of "Metaion" prevents it from being destroyed by battle and reduces the Battle Damage to 0. Since "Metaion" was involved in battle, its effect returns all monsters his opponent controls to their owners hand and inflicts 300 damage to the opponent for each card returned to them. The five "Wisel" components are returned to Aporia's hand and he is once again, violently thrown back by a blast as his Life Points drop to 500.
 Since "Metaion" can't be destroyed by battle, Crow says that it must be destroyed by a Spell or Trap Card, but Aporia corrects him, pointing out that "Metaion" cannot be destroyed. Z-one explains that "Metaion" is the "Lord of all lords" and cannot be destroyed by anyone. However Aporia still insists that he will not lose because he has hope.
 Aporia begins his turn and  draws  " Afterglow ". As long as he has this card, he thinks that he can still fight. He believes that it is a card of hope that will bring forth a miracle. Aporia Summons " Sky Core " and Yusei wonders if he plans on Summoning " Meklord Emperor Skiel ". However if he does that, attacking "Metaion" will only result in it returning to his hand and him taking more damage than he has Life Points. He wonders just what Aporia is planning.
