 Description 
 Odion is the servant of the Ishtar family and has sworn his allegiance to Marik. An honest Duelist who Duels fair and square, his Deck is comprised of  Trap Monsters , such as " Embodiment of Apophis ", to ensnare his unsuspecting opponents.
 
 Biography 
 Immediately after the player claims the reward for Odion's appropriate Character Unlock Mission, they will encounter Odion for the first time. At the time, he is engaged in a Duel with  Jay , the latter struggling against him. After Odion defeats Jay with his " Judgment of Anubis " card, Odion reveals that he himself never thought he'd be able to Duel again after all the darkness he experienced. He then wonders if his own presence in Duel World means that "Master Marik" is in Duel World as well.
 Until the player defeats Odion for the first time, whenever they challenge Odion to a Duel, he will observe that the player is a noble Duelist, one that is worthy of battling. He tells the player that he'll show the player what he's capable of, if they wish to Duel him, but also warns the player that they may come to regret their decision. He then asks the player if they still have the courage to Duel him, before accepting the situation and declaring that they should begin.
 Upon Odion's first defeat, he remarks that the player's tactics were most impressive. He goes on to claim that since the player showed no fear against his strategies, that proves they are an honorable Duelist. Odion then declares that it was his privilege to Duel the player, before prompting the player to continue their journey and seek their glory.
 After the player redeems their final unclaimed reward for Odion's Character Unlock Missions, they will encounter Odion again, who tells the player that even when people are lost in the darkness, those people must not lose their will to fight for the light, something which he proclaims he's done his whole life. He recommends that this is something the player should do as well. Odion goes on to declare that fighting for the light is fighting for one's own existence, and that he himself will keep fighting with his " Embodiment of Apophis " card. He concludes his dialogue by stating his quest for the light shall never end.

 Trivia 
 Some of the cards for which Odion has card-specific dialogue, such as his  Trap Monsters  (excluding  Embodiment of Apophis ), were not used in the anime or manga, and are references to his video game counterpart ( Tag Force ) using those said cards.
 " Ghost Knight of Jackal ", " Mystical Knight of Jackal ", and " The End of Anubis " were likely added to compliment Odion's Deck being Egyptian-themed. 
 In the voice lines found in the game files, Odion erroneously labels " Temple of the Kings " as a Trap Card, when it is a Spell Card. 
 Mako Tsunami  and Odion are the Legendary Duelists who have cut-in frames of themselves and/or their face(s) for all the Monster Cards for which they have card-specific dialogue. 
 Scud ,  Rex Raptor ,  Téa Gardner (DM) , Mako Tsunami, and Odion, in ascending order, are the characters with the least card-specific dialogue in-game.

 The aforementioned characters, excluding Prana, have the average amount of character-specific dialogue a Legendary Duelist possesses.
