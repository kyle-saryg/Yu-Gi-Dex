 Appearance 
       Full-body image of Kaseki.     
 Kaseki is a tan-skinned bespectacled boy of average height with brown hair that spikes out to the sides in a somewhat similar manner to  Jim Crocodile Cook  and green eyes. He wears clothing designed for the outdoors; a tan shirt with the sleeves rolled up, thick green pants tucked into brown boots, white gloves for careful handling of fossils, a tan wide-brimmed had with a red band around the base, a brown satchel, and a green bandanna around his neck with a dinosaur face print.
 
 Personality 
 Kaseki is a friendly individual, and despite not being the president of the  Dueling & Dinosaur Research Club  he is the most forward of the group and seems to make many of their decisions. He is tremendously disappointed after finding that  Gossie  was not real.
 
 Etymology 
 Kaseki's first name is the Japanese word for "fossil", befitting his passion.
