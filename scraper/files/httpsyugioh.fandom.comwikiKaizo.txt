 Appereance 
       Kaizo before modification     
       Kaizo in his robot mode.     
 Kaizo is a green, spherical  Goha Corporation drone  with a blue screen that serves as both a display and Kaizo's face. Following its modifications by  Yuga Ohdo , it has a red top that resembles a bottle cap with a gold tube at the side, and blue cylindrical appendages with white rims; the left one with some yellow plating.
 
 Personality 
 Upon being modified by Yuga, Kaizo has shown to possess free will and individuality among other drones. It is a fan of  Romin Kassidy  and her music, even to the point of putting down its modifier. After several modifications, it is shown to hit on other girls, including the photographer of the newspaper club.
 
 Etymology 
       Handsome Kaizo     
 "Kaizo" is a Japanese word meaning "remodel" or "modification", referring to Yuga remodeling Kaizo from a Goha Corporation drone. Yuga picks this name in the spur of the moment, a name that Kaizo feels is too literal.
 
 Voice and Manierisms 
 During his business persona, he tends to do business-themed puns.
