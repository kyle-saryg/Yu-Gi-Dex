 Prior Events 
 After  Yugi Muto  defeats  Mai Valentine  in the first round of the  Duelist Kingdom  Semi-finals, the Duel between Bandit Keith and Joey Wheeler was about to begin. Joey was prepared to face Keith, only to find him on a couch outside the arena. When both participants were asked to present their entry cards, Keith presented his card but Joey could not find his since the night before Keith stole Joey's card, but was allowed to search for it, however if he did not return with the card by 11 o'clock, he would be disqualified. Joey searched frantically for his card, but broke down in tears because he lost his only chance to save his sister,  Serenity Wheeler . Mai finds him and gives him her handkerchief, which contained her entry card. Joey returned and showed his (Mai's) entry card. Keith was shocked because he stole Joey's card the night before, but was unphased since he thinks he could win anyway.

 Red Eyes Black Metal Dragon (ATK: 3400 → 2400; DEF: 2400 → 3400)

Joey admits that the entry card he used was Mai's, but was curious as to how Keith knew of this.  Maximillion Pegasus  says that it was obvious Keith stole Joey's card. Tristan says Keith should be disqualified instead of Joey, and Pegasus agrees with him, and not just for his crime outside the ring, he also explains that Keith also kept his other two "7 Completed" cards in his wristband. Pegasus orders his guards to take away Keith and he himself congratulates Joey for a well fought duel. Keith would not take this lying down as he attempts to assault Pegasus (in the Japanese version, Keith threatens to shoot Pegasus with his gun), but he activates a trap door which causes Keith to fall into the ocean.
