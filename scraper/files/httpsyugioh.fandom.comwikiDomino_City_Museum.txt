 Curator Kanekura  and  Yoshimori  put on the  Egypt Unearthed  exhibition, displaying treasures they found from  their excavation  of a tomb in the  Valley of the Kings . Among the objects taken from the tomb were the mummy itself and papyrus depicting the  Weighing of the Heart .  Yugi  and his friends visited to the exhibition. Kanekura took this opportunity to put Yugi's  Millennium Puzzle  on display and attempted to sell it for his own profit.  Shadi  also went, in order to punish Kanekura and Yoshimori for defiling the territory of the Gods. He performed  a Weighing of the Heart   Shadow Game  with Kanekura, killing him. Afterwards he found the  Millennium Puzzle  and learned that Yugi had solved it. Shadi entered Yugi's  soul room  while in the museum to test Yugi, but wound up being  tested  by  the other Yugi . Shadi also intended to put Yoshimori on trial, but after finding he was expected to see Yugi, he used Yoshimori in a game to test Yugi. [1] [2] [3] 
 Ishizu Ishtar  put on  The Art of Egypt  exhibition at the museum. The exhibition included a giant slab depicting a battle between the  Priest Seto  and the  Nameless Pharaoh . She tried to use this to alert  Seto Kaiba  of his connection to the past and persuade him to put on the  Battle City  tournament to gather the  Egyptian Gods .  Yami Yugi  and  Téa Gardner  also visited the exhibition. Ishizu recognized Yami as the incarnation of the pharaoh and showed him the slab.
 An exhibition of treasures found in a tomb, including the  Pyramid of Light  were put on display. Yugi and  Téa  visited it as they hid from a group of duelists after Yugi's  Egyptian God  cards. [4]
