 Introduction Error 
 In the intro to the article, it states that this series is before  Dawn of the Duel . That much is accurate. However, it states that  Yu-Gi-Oh! The Movie: Pyramid of Light  is  after  the finale. That's impossible, as Atem is in said movie.  SenatorConfer  ( talk  â€¢  contribs ) 15:52, September 5, 2018 (UTC)
