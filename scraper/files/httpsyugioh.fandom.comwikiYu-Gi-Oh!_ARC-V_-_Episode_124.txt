 Featured Duel: Yuya Sakaki/Yuto vs. Lulu Obsidian 
         Lulu  vs  Yuya .     
 At the start of the  Duel , the  Field Spell Card  " Crossover " is  activated , as per the rules of an  Action Duel . It will allow the players to use  Action Cards , but they may only have one in their  hand  at a time.
 Turn 1: Yuya 
 Yuya 's hand contains two copies of " The Phantom Knights of Lost Vambrace ", " The Phantom Knights' Twin Medals ", " The Phantom Knights' Rank-Up-Magic Burial " and " The Phantom Knights' Round Blaze ". He  Sets  three cards.
 Turn 2: Lulu 
As neither player  controls   monsters ,  Lulu   Special Summons  " Lyrilusc - Turquoise Warbler " (100/0) from her hand in  Attack Position  via its own  effect . As it was Special Summoned, she activates its effect, which lets her Special Summon a  Level  1 " Lyrilusc " monster from her hand. Lulu Special Summons " Lyrilusc - Sapphire Swallow " (100/0) in Attack Position. Lulu  overlays  her two Level 1 monsters to  Xyz Summon  " Lyrilusc - Assembled Nightingale " (0/0) in Attack Position. The effect of "Assembled Nightingale" increases its  ATK  by 100 for each of its  Overlay Units  (0 → 200). Lulu activates " Parasite Discharge ", letting her Special Summon a " Fusion Parasite " from her hand or  Deck . She Special Summons one (0/0) from her Deck. Since it was Special Summoned, the effect of "Fusion Parasite" activates, allowing Lulu to  Fusion Summon  a monster using it and monsters in her hand or on her  field  as  Fusion Materials ,  substituting  it for another Fusion Material. After the Fusion Summon, "Fusion Parasite" will be  equipped  to the Summoned monster and if that monster would be  destroyed by battle  or card effect, "Fusion Parasite" can be  destroyed  instead. Lulu  fuses  "Fusion Parasite", treated as "Assembled Nightingale", with "Assembled Nightingale" as a "Lyrilusc" monster to Fusion Summon " Lyrilusc - Independent Nightingale " (1000/0) in Attack Position. "Independent Nightingale" gains one Level for each Overlay Unit "Assembly Nightingale" had before the Fusion Summon and gains 500 ATK for each Level it has. ("Independent Nightingale":   1 →   3, 1000 → 2500). Lulu activates the effect of "Independent Nightingale", inflicting 500  damage  to Yuya for each Level it has (Yuya: 4000 → 2500 LP). 
 "Independent Nightingale"  attacks   directly , but Yuya activates his two  face-down  copies of "The Phantom Knights of Lost Vambrace", preventing " The Phantom Knights " monsters he controls from being destroyed by battle this turn and decreasing the ATK of a monster his opponent controls by 600. ("Independent Nightingale": 2500 → 1300 ATK). After activation, the two "Lost Vambraces" Special Summon themselves as  Normal Monsters  (600/0 each) in Attack Position. A  replay  occurs and "Independent Nightingale" attacks a "Lost Vambrace" (Yuya: 2500 → 1800 LP), which is not destroyed due to its own effect. As Yuya took  battle damage , he activates his face-down  Quick-Play Spell Card  "The Phantom Knights' Twin Medals", allowing him to Xyz Summon a monster using two "The Phantom Knights" monsters he controls with the same Level. Yuya overlays his two Level 2 monsters to Xyz Summon " The Phantom Knights of Cursed Javelin " (1600/0) in Attack Position. Yuya activates its effect,  detaching  an Overlay Unit to  negate  the effects of a monster his opponent controls and reduce its ATK to 0. He chooses "Independent Nightingale" (1200 → 0). 
 At this point,  Celina  enters the Duel and takes the intrusion penalty (Celina: 4000 → 2000 LP). 
 Turn 3: Celina 
Celina draws "Fusion Parasite" and subsequently  Normal Summons  it (0/0). She activates the  Continuous Spell Card , " Parasite Factory ", allowing her to Fusion Summon a monster with "Fusion Parasite" and a monster equipped with another "Fusion Parasite". After the Fusion Summon, all "Fusion Parasites" will be equipped to the Summoned monster, increasing its ATK by 300 for each. She fuses "Independent Nightingale", which is equipped with "Fusion Parasite" and her own "Fusion Parasite" to Fusion Summon " Parasite Queen " (1800/???) in Attack Position (1800 → 2400). Yuya activates the effect of "Cursed Javelin", detaching an Overlay Unit to negate the effect of a monster his opponent controls and reduce its ATK to 0, but the effect of "Parasite Factory" renders the Summoned monster  unaffected  by card effects. "Parasite Queen" attacks and destroys "Cursed Javelin" (Yuya: 1800 → 1000 LP). Celina Sets a card.
 At this point Yuya switches with  Yuto .
 Turn 4: Yuto 
Yuto activates " The Phantom Knights' Rank-Up-Magic Burial ", allowing him to Special Summon a "The Phantom Knights"  Xyz Monster  from his  Graveyard , then Xyz Summon an Xyz Monster whose  Rank  is two Ranks higher than that of the Summoned monster, by using that monster as the Overlay Unit, then "Burial" will  attach  itself to the Summoned monster as an Overlay Unit. He Special Summons "Cursed Javelin" and performs a  Rank-Up Xyz Evolution  to Special Summon " Dark Rebellion Xyz Dragon " (2500/2000) in Attack Position.
 Duel continues in the next episode .
