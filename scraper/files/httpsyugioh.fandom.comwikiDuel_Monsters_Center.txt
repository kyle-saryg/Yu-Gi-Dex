The  Duel Monsters Center  (デュエル モンスター センター) is a parlor in  Domino City , where the  Duel Monsters  card game is played.
 The center appeared in the  Yu-Gi-Oh! Movie , made by  Toei Animation .  Anzu Mazaki  had a job here. Similar to when she worked at  Burger World , she was annoyed to find her friends appear there as customers and discover she had a job, as it was against school rules to have part time jobs.
 Here  Yugi  and  Jonouchi  were teaching  Miho  how to play  Duel Monsters .
 Shougo Aoyama  is also a regular at the center.
