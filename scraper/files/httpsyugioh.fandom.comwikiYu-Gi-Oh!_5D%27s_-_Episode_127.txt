 "Tricking The Trickster" , known as  "Fierce Fight! Destiny Riding on Black Feathers!"  in Japan, is the 127th episode of  Yu-Gi-Oh! 5D's .
 It's  Crow  vs.  Broder . Pitted against Broder, who  Summons  " Loki, Lord of the Aesir ", gathering two Gods onto the  field , Crow has no monsters on his field and he has only 50  Life Points  remaining.  
 Moreover, the  effects  of  Spell  and  Trap Cards  are of no use against the Gods. In such an overwhelmingly disadvantageous situation, Crow fights to the last of his power. 
 Broder warns Crow that if he  draws  a  Speed Spell  on his next  turn , the match will become a hopeless scenario from which defeat is inescapable. In the end he doesn't draw a Speed Spell, but decides to defeat Crow now. Broder is aware that he can use the effect of "Speed World 2" and the effect of "Loki" to take out Crow's face-downs, but then realizes that Crow already knows that. Broder deduces that Crow's face-downs are bluffs in an attempt to get him to waste his Speed Counters so that way he will have less Speed Counters when Yusei Fudo takes over. Can Crow come out of this almost hopeless situation before the  attack  of the Gods wipe him out?

 Featured Duels 
 Crow Hogan vs. Broder 
 ...continued from previous episode. 
 Turn 13:  Crow Hogan 
Crow draws "Black Wing". During the Standby Phase, the effect of " Speed World 2 " activates (Crow's SPC: 7 → 8; Broder's SPC: 11 → 12). Crow then  activates  the  effect  of "Speed World 2" to remove seven  Speed Counters  (Crow's SPC: 8 → 1) and  draw  a card ("Black Wing"). Crow  Sets  two cards.
 Turn 14:  Broder 
Broder draws, intending to draw a Speed Spell (to use with the effect of "Speed World 2" to remove four Speed Counters and inflict 800 damage to Crow for each Speed Spell in his hand, which will cause Crow to lose), but he doesn't draw one. During the Standby Phase, the effect of "Speed World 2" activates (Crow's SPC: 1 → 2; Broder's SPC: 12). Broder activates the effect of "Speed World 2" to remove ten Speed Counters (Broder's SPC: 12 → 2) and  destroy  one of Crow's Set cards (" Black Wing "). 
 " Loki, Lord of the Aesir " attacks  directly , but Crow activates his face-down second copy of "Black Wing" to  negate  the attack by  removing from play  a " Blackwing "  monster  from his  Graveyard , however Broder activates the effect of "Loki, Lord of the Aesir" to negate the effect of "Black Wing" and destroy it. Crow removes from play " Blackwing - Calima the Haze " from his Graveyard in order to revive " Black-Winged Dragon " ( 8/2800/1600) in Attack Position. 
 A replay occurs and Broder uses "Loki" to attack "Black-Winged Dragon", but Crow activates the second effect of "Black Wing", removing from play the two copies of "Black Wing" in his  Graveyard  in order to destroy "Black-Winged Dragon" and "Loki" and inflict the ATK of "Loki" as damage to Broder (Broder 2950 → 0). Broder then chains his face-down " Dromi the Sacred Shackles " to inflict damage to Crow equal to the ATK difference between "Black-Winged Dragon" and "Loki" (Crow 50 → 0). The Duel ends in a  DRAW .
 Due to the rulings of the WRGP, it immediately goes to Broder's End Phase. Broder activates the effect of "Loki, Lord of the Aesir" to revive itself ( 10/3300/3000) in Attack Position.
 Broder and Crow pass the baton to  Halldor  and  Yusei Fudo  respectively and both Duelists proceed forward in Dueling against each other.
 
 Yusei Fudo vs. Halldor 
 Turn 15: Yusei Fudo 
Yusei draws "Cosmic Compass". During the Standby Phase, the effect of "Speed World 2" activates (Yusei's SPC: 2 → 3; Halldor's SPC: 2 → 3). Yusei then Normal Summons " Cosmic Compass " ( 1/100/300) in  Defense Position . Since "Cosmic Compass" was Normal Summoned, Yusei activates its effect to Special Summon two " Compass Tokens " ( 1/0/0 for both) in Defense Position (one for each monster Halldor controls). Yusei  Sets  two cards.
 Turn 16: Halldor 
Halldor draws. During the Standby Phase, the effect of "Speed World 2" activates (Yusei's SPC: 3 → 4; Halldor's SPC: 3 → 4).  Yusei  activates his face-down " Monster Chain ", which gains three  Chain Counters  (one for each monster Yusei controls). While "Monster Chain" is face-up, neither player can declare an attack. During each of Halldor's End Phases, Yusei must remove a Chain Counter from "Monster Chain". When "Monster Chain" has no Chain Counters, it will be destroyed.
 Halldor  Normal Summons  " Valkyrie of the Nordic Ascendant " ( 2/400/800) in Attack Position. Halldor then activates the effect of "Valkyrie of the Nordic Ascendant" to send " Interdimensional Matter Transporter " and " Baton of the Hero " from his  hand  to the  Graveyard  and  Special Summon  two " Einherjar Tokens " ( 4/1000/1000 for both) in Defense Position. Halldor then tunes his two "Einherjar Tokens" with "Valkyrie of the Nordic Ascendant" in order to  Synchro Summon  " Odin, Father of the Aesir " ( 10/4000/3500) in Attack Position.

 Mistakes 
 Due to Broder's Trap activation being shown early (to provide a visualization of the 'simultaneous' tie), the effect is explained incorrectly and "Loki" is listed as the monster whose being removed from play triggered the effect instead of "Black Feather Dragon". This is likely also due to that part of the effect of "Calima" effect not being explained, which also resulted in no explanation for "Black Feather Dragon" leaving the field (much like " Red Dragon Archfiend " and the effect of " Rage Resynchro " in  episode 98 ). 
 In the English dub, when Yusei sets two cards on the field at the end of his first turn (Turn 15), the original Japanese card for " Monster Chain " can be seen in his hand, rather than the dubbed card design.
