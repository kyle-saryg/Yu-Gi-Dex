 Biography 
 History 
 The group came to be formed after their  city  was maliciously attacked by Duelists from  Duel Academy . [3]  During that time  Shay 's sister,  Lulu , was captured. None of the members of the Resistance knew where she was. [4]  The backbone of the Resistance was formed by Duelists from the  Clover  and  Spade  branches of  Heartland Duel School , who were training to become professional Duelists. [2] 
 After finding out that  Leo Akaba  had  a son , Yuto and Shay concluded that if they captured that son they'd be able to do a hostage exchange and recover Lulu, so they went to the  Standard Dimension  to target students of  LID  in order to lure out Declan. [5] 
 Sometime after Yuto and Shay left, Duel Academy carried out a large assault. Most of the Resistance was wiped out, with what survivors (and non-combatants) remaining relocating to the  Duel Sanctuary . [2]   Kite  also chose to cut ties with the rest of the Resistance after his family was  sealed into cards  and seeked revenge. [6] 
 The Resistance's Spade forces were almost destroyed by the  Tyler   sisters . [7] 
 
 Pre-Arc League Championship 
 Yuto Dueled against  Sylvio  and asked him how LID was connected to Duel Academy. Sylvio responded that he had no idea what Yuto was talking about. [8]  Sometime later Shay succeeded in his plan to lure out Declan, only to find out that the plan was futile as Leo Akaba didn't care much about his son. Declan instead offered an alliance to Shay if he participated in the  Arc League Championship .
 
 Arc League Championship 
 After being defeated by  Yugo , Yuto's soul was absorbed by  Yuya , leaving Shay as the only member of the Resistance in the Standard Dimension. [9] 
 
 Friendship Cup 
 During his Duel with Shay,  Dennis  explained the story of how he met Lulu among the Resistance members. [1] 
 
 Heartland City 
 When Yuya,  Gong , Shay, and Sylvio were accidentally warped to the  Xyz Dimension , Shay split up with them to check on the Resistance's base. He found it abandoned and concluded that this comrades had been wiped out in his absence. Yuya, Gong and Sylvio wandered through the dilapidated streets and had found a refugee family who told them that most of the Resistance was wiped out by Duel Academy's students. [5] 
 Reaching their hideout, Kite asked his Resistance comrades to go together with him and assist Yuya, arriving just in time as  Mamoru Noro  ordered the Duel Academy soldiers to attack Yuya along with  Aster  and Tyler sisters who have decided to defect. He reminded Mamoru that he should be facing him first since he was on Duel Academy's wanted list, though the former doubt he could beat him and his Resistance comrades. He challenged Mamoru to Duel him if he has the resolve to put his life on the line, forcing the frightened Vice Commander-in-Chief to surrender. [10] 
 
 Duel Academy 
       Resistance members freed.     
 Due to the dimensions merging members of the Resistance were freed from their cards and were seen on a floating island. They noticed  Allen  and  Saya  and waved to them. [11]
