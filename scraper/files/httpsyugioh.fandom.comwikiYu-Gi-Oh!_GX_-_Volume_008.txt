 This section, or a part of it, has been transcluded from  Yu-Gi-Oh! GX - Volume 001 ; any changes involving it should be made  there  instead.  /  
 Years after Yugi's legendary battles, the game is so popular that special institutions dedicated to the art of the Duel have sprung up all over the world. Join Jaden Yuki and his pals at the Academy for the adventures of the next generation of "Yu-Gi-Oh!" [1] 
 Masked Hero vs. Vision Hero 
 The next series of duels at Duel Academy are about to begin and Reggie Mackenzie's father, possessed by an evil spirit, determined to wreck havoc, makes his move. By manipulating members of the group of visiting duelists from America, Mackenzie plants the seed of destruction on Duel Academy Island. When Jaden takes on his next opponent, will he realize the evil he faces, or will an ancient spirit's scheme to resurrect itself go forward? [1] 
 
 The Story So Far 
 On an island in the southern sea stands an academy where the next generation of duelists is trained. It is called Duel Academy! 
 Jaden Yuki learned about the excitement of dueling through an encounter with the World Dueling Champion, Koyo Hibiki. Entrusted with Hibiki's deck, Jaden takes on all challengers at the Academy in order to become a true duelist! 
 Having learned of the black shadow that's after the spirit cards, Jaden resolved to new fight with a new deck of his own! Then, several American duelists arrived for an exchange battle. Alexis and Bastion's team won their tag battle, and Syrus's and Chazz's duel put the Duel Academy ahead 2–0. Now only Jaden is left, and his opponent is Aster Phoenix, another Heroes user. How will Jaden manage against a Pro Duelist?! [2] 
 
 In the Next Volume… 
 The possessed Principal Mackenzie makes his final bid to crush the students of Duel Academy and seize Chazz and Jaden's Spirit Cards! Jaden will need all his dueling skill as he battles his way through to the final Duel, fighting for his friends, his mentor Koyo Hibiki, and the fate of Duel Academy itself!

 Message from Kazuki Takahashi 
 I hadn't seen Jaden in a while, so when I came face-to-face with him when he appeared in the theatrical "Yu-Gi-Oh!" anime, I was moved by how much he'd grown as a character and how reliable he seemed! I'm really looking forward to seeing how the manga Jaden grows as well! [2] 
 
 Message from Naoyuki Kageyama 
 It's already been five years since I started work on this serial. That said, It's gone by quickly. In that time, all sorts of things around me have changed, and of course I've changed as well. I suppose that will keep happening. [2]
