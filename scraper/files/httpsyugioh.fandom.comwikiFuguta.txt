 Biography 
 Yu-Gi-Oh! 
 Battle City 
       Roland and Fuguta in Yu-Gi-Oh! GX.     
 During  Battle City , Fuguta and Roland stood in  Domino Stadium  to welcome the finalists as they arrived. When  Seto Kaiba  appeared, he ordered them to turn on the stadium lights. When  Yugi Muto ,  Joey Wheeler ,  Mai Valentine ,  Téa Gardner ,  Tristan Taylor ,  Serenity Wheeler  and  Duke Devlin  arrived, Roland confirmed Yugi, Joey and Mai had the required number of  Locator Cards  and Fuguta then gave them ID cards, instructed them to hold on to them at all times. He and Roland later tried to stop Téa, Tristan, Serenity and Duke boarding the  Kaiba Craft 3  as they were not finalists. However  Mokuba Kaiba  said to let them on. Fuguta protested, but Mokuba appealed to Seto, who allowed it. After they boarded, Kaiba ordered the blimp to take off, despite Fuguta and Roland pointing out the last finalist had not yet arrived.  Ishizu Ishtar  arrived in time to be the eighth finalist and Fuguta confirmed that she had enough locator cards. He and Roland later tried to inform Kaiba of Ishizu's arrival, but Mokuba warned them not to interrupt him while he was preparing for his Duels. [2] 
 As the lottery to determine the pairings for the first Duel of the quarter finals was about to begin, Fuguta informed Ishizu that her presence was required. However Ishizu insisted that she was not needed as she knew she would be taking part in the fourth Duel. [3] 
 
 Doma 
 When  Dartz  took control of  KaibaCorp , Seto told Roland that he was no longer his boss after Roland referred to him as "sir" (In the Japanese version, he called him Seto- sama ). However Fuguta insisted that he would stand by Seto's side until he was back in control of KaibaCorp and Roland agreed. [4] 
 
 Yu-Gi-Oh! GX 
 Fuguta and Roland also appear in  Yu-Gi-Oh! GX  series during  Jaden 's flashback of one KaibaCorp card illustration project. [5] 
 He and Roland greeted  Sartorius  and escorted him to a meeting with Kaiba. [6]
