 Summary 
   This summary is currently incomplete. 
 Due to attacks from " Dark Paladin ",  Seto Kaiba  has just lost his Duel to  Yugi Muto , putting him out of the  Battle City  tournament. Feeling that he had been cheated out of his glory,  Kaiba  refuses to listen to reason—or accept the fact that  Yugi  won because he'd had support from friends. After tossing " Obelisk the Tormentor "  Yugi 's way,  Kaiba  walks away in a huff, but then,  Joey Wheeler  foolishly convinces him to accept his challenge to a friendly Duel for third place. However, if there's anything  Seto Kaiba  doesn't know, it's the meaning of the word "friendly" especially after just losing to his rival.
 
 Featured Duel: Seto Kaiba vs. Joey Wheeler - Part 1 
 Turn 1: Seto Kaiba 
Seto draws. He then Normal Summons " Ryu-Kishin Powered " (1600/1200) in  Attack Position  and Sets two cards.
 Turn 2: Joey Wheeler 
Joey draws " Gearfried the Iron Knight " and subsequently Normal Summons it (1800/1600) in Attack Position. "Gearfried" attacks Seto's "Ryu-Kishin Powered" and Seto activates his face-down " Shrink " to halve the ATK of "Ryu-Kishin Powered" ("Ryu-Kishin Powered": 1600 → 800/1200). "Gearfried" destroys "Ryu-Kishin Powered" ( Seto  4000 → 3000), but Seto then activates his face-down " Crush Card " to destroy Joey's "Gearfried the Iron Knight" and every monster in his hand, on his side of the field, and in his  Deck  that have 1500 or more ATK.  Also, due to the  Lingering Effect  of "Crush Card Virus", those monsters cannot be  Special Summoned  from the  Graveyard .
 Turn 3: Seto Kaiba 
Seto draws. He then Normal Summons " La Jinn the Mystical Genie of the Lamp " (1800/1000) in Attack Position. "La Jinn" attacks directly ( Joey  4000 → 2200).
 Turn 4: Joey Wheeler 
Joey's hand contains "Swordsman of Landstar", " Little-Winguard ", " Legendary Sword ", " Nutrient Z ", and " Graverobber ". Joey draws "Graceful Dice". He then Normal Summons " Swordsman of Landstar " (500/1200) in  Attack Position . Joey then activates " Graceful Dice " to roll a die and multiply the ATK of "Swordsman of Landstar" by the result. Joey gets a four ("Swordsman of Landstar": 500 → 2000/1200). "Swordsman of Landstar" attacks & destroys "La Jinn the Mystical Genie of the Lamp" ( Seto  3000 → 2800). On Joey's End Phase, the effect of "Graceful Dice" expires ("Swordsman of Landstar": 2000 → 500/1200).
 Duel continues next episode. 
 
 Errors 
 After Joey and Kaiba draw their first cards, Téa is seen from the side, slightly between Yami Yugi (on her right) and Tristan (on her left), but in the next scene Tristan is on Yami's right. After talking about how much Joey's skill has increased, Téa is nowhere to be seen, but then she is right next to Yami's left in the scene after.
