      Spirit Keys     
 Spirit Keys  are items created by  Kagemaru  along with the  Spirit Gates  as a means of getting high-level duelists to duel each other in order to generate the duel energy necessary to revive the  Sacred Beasts .
 Kagemaru said that they were unnecessary to open the gate.  Sheppard  gave one key to the seven top duelists at  Duel Academy :  Chazz ,  Bastion ,  Jaden ,  Alexis ,  Crowler ,  Zane , and  Banner .
 
 Trivia 
 The seven Spirit Keys appear in the artwork of " Raviel, Lord of Phantasms ", " Uria, Lord of Searing Flames ", and " Hamon, Lord of Striking Thunder ".
