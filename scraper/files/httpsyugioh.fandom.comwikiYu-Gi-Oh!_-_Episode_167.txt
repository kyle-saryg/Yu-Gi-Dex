 Summary 
 With phoned-in assistance, Mokuba manages to stabilize the plane and contact KaibaCorp to come to help. But the vision of the KaibaCorp choppers and planes enrages Alister, convincing him that Kaiba really is exactly like his step-father. The "Seal" breaks the plane's windows and damages the autopilot controls again. Alister empties Kaiba's field and hand and then Summons his ace monster, " Air Fortress Ziggurat ", a monster based on the Dyna Dude action figure that Alister keeps as a memento of his brother. Despite the odds, Kaiba is able to bring out " Blue-Eyes White Dragon " and counterattack with " Tyrant Wing ". Kaiba claims that if he'd been in Alister's place, he'd definitely have done the impossible to save his brother. Alister, confident of his victory and the demise of all three of them, ends his turn early. Kaiba draws " The Fang of Critias " and fuses it with "Tyrant Wing" into " Tyrant Burst Dragon ". Then he uses it to power up his "Blue-Eyes" into the " Blue-Eyes Tyrant Dragon " form to win the Duel with seconds to spare, and " The Seal of Orichalcos " claims Alister's soul. Moments before falling, he smiles after a look at Mokuba, seeing instead the brother that he protected so long ago.
 Kaiba rushes to the controls after the Duel. His determination to save his brother calls the the Legendary Dragon in his deck and the three Legendary Dragons appear to help safely land the plane.  Yami Yugi  and Téa encounter Joey and Tristan, all four having witnessed the plane spectacle and rushed to the scene. The plane manages to land in one piece and Kaiba disembarks, surprised to meet Yami Yugi in a such a place. He declares that they might be "useful" for his purposes, after hearing from Roland, who lands with one of the choppers with bad news for Kaiba: Doma has bought the whole of the company and taken it over.
 Meanwhile, a computer reports to Dartz that the takeover has been completed.

Alister then Tributes a "Robot Token" in order to Tribute Summon " Spell Canceller " (1800 → 2300/1600) in  Attack Position . As long as this monster is face-up on the field, Kaiba is forbidden from activating any Magic Cards. "Air Fortress Ziggurat" attacks "Blue-Eyes White Dragon", but Seto activates his face-down " Tyrant Wing " to equip the latter to "Blue-Eyes White Dragon" and increase its ATK by 400 ("Blue-Eyes White Dragon": 3000 → 3400/2500).

 Differences in adaptations 
 Cut from the dub is a short scene where Roland orders the helicopters, saying they have to save  Kaiba  and  Mokuba , and then a shot of the Kaiba Corp USA building. 
 Cut from the dub is a sequence of where  Mokuba  exclaims over  Alister 's monster, and stares up at it from behind his brother. Then  Alister  says  this Monster  is his trump Card, as a shot of his hand holding his brother  Mikey 's toy is superimposed over the Ziggurat. 
 Cut from the dub are shots of " Air Fortress Ziggurat " zeroing its guns on  Kaiba . 
 Also cut from the dub is a shot of "Air Fortress Ziggurat" exploding when  Kaiba  destroys it. 
 Errors 
 During this episode, Kaiba activates " Junk Dealer " in Alister's  Graveyard  thanks to the effect of " Magical Trick Mirror ", and  Special Summons  " Judge Man " back from his own  Graveyard . In the English anime, probably due to a mistake in translation, Seto declares "Judge Man" comes back  in Defense Position to protect [Seto's] Life Points . However this is clearly not the case, as when Alister's "Air Fortress Ziggurat" attacks "Judge Man" Seto is shown to lose 1900 LP in  Battle Damage , bringing his total to 100  Life Points . 
 Due to another translation error, Alister said "Toy Robot Box" required him to discard three cards but he only needed to discard one.
