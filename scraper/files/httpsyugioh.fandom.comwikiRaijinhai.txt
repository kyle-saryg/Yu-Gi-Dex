Raijinhai  (雷神牌) is a game from the  Toei  Yu-Gi-Oh!  anime , where it is said to have originated in India. It is a guessing based game where two players use their pieces to eliminate the other's. The win conditions apparently vary, but three are presented in the show:
 
 The opponent has no more pieces 
 The opponent has no pieces stronger than the other player's 
 The opponent's king has been taken. 
 Pieces are chosen behind a screen and so the game is based on the player's knowledge of statistics as well as their application of psychology.  Aileen Rao  challenged  Dark Yugi  to a game with  Anzu Mazaki 's life on the line.
 The pieces and what they do are as follows:
 
 Raijin Indra   Strongest piece, can only be used once in a game Queen          Can only beat king, destroyed by all others King           Beats shogun, elephant, cavalry and soldier Shogun         Beats elephant, cavalry, soldier and queen Elephant       Beats cavalry, soldier and queen, can use 2 in a game Cavalry        Beats soldier and queen, can use 2 in a game Soldier        Destroyed by all except queen, can use 2 in a game
