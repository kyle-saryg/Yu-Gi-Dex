 Events 
 After  Yugi Muto  and his friends get trapped by  Bandit Keith  and his goons, the latter of which he left behind after  Bonz 's loss,  Bakura Ryou 's Millenium Ring suddenly activates and acts like a dowsing rod, leading the group to the location of Pegasus, since the ring can detect and seek out other Millenium Items, like Pegasus's Millenium Eye. As they head closer,  Téa Gardner  notices the walls in the cave look more manmade. Soon, they discover and enter  a strange room  and meet the  Paradox Brothers , who introduce them as Eliminators. They challenge Yugi and Joey to a tag-team duel, with Joey wagering two of his eight star chips and Yugi wagers four of his six. With this wager, if they win, Yugi and Joey will each have ten star chips and thus enter Pegasus's castle. However, both reveal that one door will lead to the way out and the other will lead to an endless labyrinth. In addition, while one of the brothers will tell only the truth, the other will tell nothing but lies.
 
 The Duel 
 Note: This duel is the first ever tag-team duel, where a team of two duelists takes on another team of two duelists. Each duelist starts with the normal amount of Life Points and if one duelist loses all their life points, the other duelist loses alongside them. 
 Turn 1: Dox 
Draws a card.  Dox  plays  Labyrinth Wall  (ATK: 0/DEF: 3000) as a field Magic Card.  Para  explains that the turn order will cycle as follows:
 Para → Joey → Dox → Yugi.
 He also explains the rules of the  Labyrinth Duel , where each duelist moves a monster a number of spaces equal to their level.  Penguin Knight  and  The Wicked Worm Beast  are used as examples to illustrate how it works.
 Also at this point, Joey remembers a riddle he heard about there being a fork in the road with a liar and a truthteller. In it he explains that a traveler found himself at a fork in the road with one path leading to a village of liars and the other a village of truthtellers, but the traveler does not know which path leads where. Fortunately there is a villager at the fork. Unfortunately the traveler does not know if he is from the village of liars or the village of truthtellers, and the villager says he may ask him one question. So the traveler asks him to lead him to his own village. If he the villager were from the village of truthtellers he would lead him to his own village, and if he were from the village of liars he would lead him to the opposite village.
 By this logic Joey asks both Para and Dox to point to the door that would lead them out and they both point to Dox's door.
 Yugi however is skeptical and tells Joey that the answer is not so easy and re-evaluates Joey's riddle to the current situation, that there are two villagers, one from the village of truthtellers and one from the village of liars. In addition, one villager claims to be from the village of truthtellers and the other is from the village of liars. And if that were the case then they would both be lying.
 After Joey clears his head, the duel proceeds.

 Turn 29: Dox 
Draws a card. Dox plays  Riryoku , which causes him to take half of Yugi  and Joey's LP and convert it into ATK for the Gate Guardian:
 
 Yami Yugi LP:  (800 → 400) 
 Joey LP: (1300 → 650) 
 Sanga of the Thunder: (ATK: 2600 → 3000) 
 Kazejin: (ATK: 2400 → 3050) 
 Dox, however, cannot attack on the turn he plays Riryoku, so he ends his turn.
 Turn 30: Yugi 
Draws a card. Yami Yugi sets a card, activates  Monster Reborn  to revive a monster, has Dark Magician move to the end of the maze and ends his turn.
 Turn 31: Para

 Turn 32: Joey 
Draws a card. Joey draws  Copycat  and thinks about how to use it since it can copy one card his opponent played. Joey plays Copycat as Riryoku, draining half of Para and Dox's Life Points and adding them to Black Skull Dragon:
 
 Para LP:  (900 → 450) 
 Dox LP: (900 → 450) 
 Black Skull Dragon: (ATK: 3200 → 4100) 
 Joey, however, cannot attack so he ends his turn.
 Turn 33: Dox 
Draws a card. Dox attacks Dark Magician with Sanga of the Thunder but Suijin intercepts the attack, however, he attacks with Kazejin destroying Suijin.
 Turn 34: Yugi 
Draws a card. Yugi activates " Monster Replace " to switch the positions of his "Dark Magician" and Joey's "B. Skull Dragon". Since it was Fusion Summoned using both his own and Joey's monsters, Yugi takes control of it and attacks "Gate Guardian", destroying both "Sanga of the Thunder" and "Kazejin" (Para and Dox: 450 → 0).
 
 Aftermath 
 Yami Yugi and Joey win their remaining Star Chips. With ten each, they were allowed entry into Pegasus's Castle, but the Paradox Bros had one more trick up their sleeve. Yugi still had to guess which door would lead them out, so Yugi placed the symbols of the brothers on two coins, one for Para and one for Dox. Instead of flipping the coins, Yugi placed a coin in each hand. And whichever coin remains clinched will be the door he chooses. When he released the coin with Dox's symbol, they both reveal Dox's door was the way out. However, Yugi outsmarted them both, by showing them that he had the coin with Dox's symbol clinched in his other hand, revealing that the coin with Para's symbol also had Dox's symbol on the other side, since they both like to manipulate the maze and the doors, so Yugi made it so that no matter what, he would always pick Dox's door. The gang finally escape and head to Pegasus's castle.
 
 Error 
 The Celtic Guardian was Yugi's monster but Joey says "My Celtic Guardian."
