 Tio (spelled as "tío") means "uncle" in Spanish, but also means "dude" or "guy" in some contexts. Herc may be short for  Hercules , a possible reference to Herc's somewhat muscular body.
 
 Biography 
 Pre-Arc League Championship 
 Herc met with  Declan  and  Henrietta Akaba  regarding the disappearance of  Marco , and presented to them Marco's  Duel Disk  and cards that his team found at the site of the incident. [1]  Later on, he met  Julia ,  Dipper , and  Kit  at the site of Marco's disappearance where they were searching for clues regarding his attack. He was evasive but polite to the students, telling them that evidence was still being gathered and that they should continue their studies. [2] 
 Sometime later,  Yuto  witnessed Herc Dueling against  Shay , who defeated him and sealed him into  a card . Shay mailed it along with  Marco's card  to Declan. [3] 
 
 Duel Academy 
 After  Z-ARC 's defeat and the  Standard Dimension  being reborn into the  "Pendulum Dimension" , Herc was freed from his  card . [4]
