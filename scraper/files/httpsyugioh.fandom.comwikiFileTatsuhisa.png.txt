 Appearance 
       Full-body image of Luke.     
 Luke is a young boy with spiky light-blue hair and red eyes. He wears a dark-brown t-shirt with a red-colored gear on a spike design, khaki pants with a black belt and black shoes with blue stripes. He also sports many accessories: a black collar around his neck, a purple-wrist watch and a blue knot on his left hand, a black wristband on his right arm, a chain tied to his right waist and a black case around his left knee.
 
 
 Personality 
 Luke is an ambitious youngster determined to become the "King of Duels", he went to big lengths to polish his Dueling skills, even training against professional adults. Luke has a tendency to exaggerate his accomplishments, which his group of friends usually figure out quickly. Luke is highly confident of his skills as a Duelist, he proclaimed himself to be the "Number One Duelist of Goha 7th Elementary".
 After learning about Yuga's desire to create Rush Duel, Luke became very interested in the idea and feels that Rush Duel could be the key to acclaim the title of "King of Duels". Although Luke has a personal interest in Rush Duel to further his ambitions, he's nevertheless a loyal friend to Yuga and chose to support Yuga's decision to make Rush Duel public knowledge despite knowing that they could get in trouble if Goha Corporation finds out that it was them who installed the Rush Duel rulings.
 Luke is highly distrustful of Goha Corporation as he suspects that they'll attempt to shut down Rush Duels and by extension ruin his chance to become "King of Duels". He can be rather paranoid over anything that he perceives as an attempt by Goha to destroy Rush Duels, even accusing his own friends of being Goha spies if they show any form of suspicious behavior.
 Luke is a technophobe that would rather destroy electronics and other machines than learn from them.
 
 Etymology 
 In kanji, his given name can be translated as "dragon eternity" while his surname can mean "higher castle".
 His nickname, Luke, which is a possible alternate reading of his given name ( 龍 久 ), can also be transliterated as "Rook". This can be a reference to his proper name containing "castle" (what rook pieces resemble and "castling" is the name of a chess move involving a rook piece and the king piece) and "dragon", which shares the same kanji used to refer to a promoted rook in shogi.
 
 Abilities 
 Luke has the ability to disable electronic devices. However, he can do so at most twice per day. He believes that this is due to his soul being possessed by a demon, but  Yuga Ohdo  suggests that it may be an example of the  Pauli effect . [2]  Luke names his ability "Luke Devil". [3]
