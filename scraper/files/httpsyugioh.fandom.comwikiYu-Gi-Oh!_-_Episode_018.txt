 Summary 
 Yugi  and the group have to deal with a number of traps including a skeleton jumping on  Bakura  and a giant boulder chasing them, which turns out to actually be inflatable.
 Joey attempts to use his " Time Wizard " to help him win the Duel, but the roulette lands on the skull, resulting in his monsters being destroyed and reducing his Life Points to 630.
 Eventually, they reach  Joey 's duel with  Bonz  and find it is not going well for Joey. Tristan throws Serenity's picture to Joey and this reminds him who he is fighting for. 
 Even then, Joey is soon left with only one monster left to use, however he draws " Shield & Sword " and uses it, making the ATK of all of Bonz's monsters 0 and allowing Joey to win the Duel. Joey tells  Bandit Keith  he will one day face him. Joey now has eight  Star Chips , meaning he only needs two more to become a finalist.
 As the group approaches the cave's exit, Keith's gang blocks the entrance with a large boulder, too heavy for any of them to budge. As punishment for losing, Keith beats up his henchmen and takes all of their Star Chips, getting a total of ten. Though this was not what he originally planned, it's still fine by him, and he strides off alone, ready to enter  Pegasus 's  castle .
 
 Featured Duel: Joey Wheeler vs. Bonz 
 
 This Duel uses  Duelist Kingdom  gameplay. Rules and  card effects  may differ from that of the  TCG / OCG . See the individual card articles for more information.     
 Duel continues from the previous episode . 
 Joey  has 1620  LP  remaining, and  controls  " Flame Swordsman " (1800/1600) in  Attack Position  and no  Set  cards. 
 Bonz  has 1350 LP remaining, and controls " Armored Zombie " (1950/0), " Dragon Zombie " (2080/0), and " Clown Zombie " (1755/0) all in Attack Position, " Call of the Haunted " and no Set cards.
 Turn 8: Joey 
Joey  Normal Summons  " Garoozis " (1800/1500) in Attack Position. "Garoozis"  attacks  and  destroys  "Clown Zombie" (Bonz: 1350 → 1305 LP). Since "Call of the Haunted's"  effect  is still  active , "Clown Zombie" is revived and its  ATK  increases by 10% of its  original ATK  ("Clown Zombie": 1350 → 1755 → 1890/0).
 Turn 9: Bonz 
"Clown Zombie" attacks and destroys "Garoozis" (Joey: 1620 → 1530 LP).
 Turn 10: Joey 
Joey  draws  " Time Wizard " and subsequently Normal Summons it (500/400) in Attack Position. Joey  activates  the  effect  of "Time Wizard", but he loses the gamble, so both of his  monsters  are destroyed and he takes  damage  equal to half of his destroyed monsters' total ATK (Joey: 1530 → 630 LP).
 Turn 11: Bonz 
Bonz passes.
 Turn 12: Joey 
Joey Sets a monster.
 Turn 13: Bonz 
Bonz draws. He then Normal Summons " Pumpking the King of Ghosts " ( 1500  → 1950/ 2000  → 2600) in Attack Position. Bonz then activates the effect of "Pumpking", which increases his other  Zombies ' ATK by 10% of their original ATK each  turn  ("Armored Zombie": 1950 → 2100/0, "Clown Zombie": 1890 → 2025/0, "Dragon Zombie": 2080 → 2240/0). "Dragon Zombie" attacks and destroys Joey's Set " Kojikocy " (1500/1200).
 Turn 14: Joey 
Joey draws. He then  Sets  a  monster .
 Turn 15: Bonz 
Bonz activates the effect of "Pumpking" ("Armored Zombie": 2100 → 2250/0, "Clown Zombie": 2025 → 2160/0, "Dragon Zombie": 2240 → 2400/0). "Dragon Zombie" attacks and destroys Joey's Set " Armored Lizard " (1500/1200).
 Turn 16: Joey 
Joey draws. He then Sets a monster.
 Turn 17: Bonz 
Bonz activates the effect of "Pumpking" ("Armored Zombie": 2250 → 2400/0, "Clown Zombie": 2160 → 2295/0, "Dragon Zombie": 2400 → 2560/0). "Dragon Zombie" attacks and destroys Joey's Set " Glassman " (1100/1000).
 Turn 18: Joey 
Joey draws. He then Sets a monster.
 Turn 19: Bonz 
Bonz activates the effect of "Pumpking" ("Armored Zombie": 2400 → 2550/0, "Clown Zombie": 2295 → 2430/0, "Dragon Zombie": 2560 → 2720/0). "Dragon Zombie" attacks and destroys Joey's Set " Masaki the Legendary Swordsman " (1100/1100).
 Turn 20: Joey 
After  Yugi  and the gang arrive and encourage Joey to continue, Joey Sets a monster.
 Turn 21: Bonz 
Bonz draws " Stop Defense ". He then activates the effect of "Pumpking" ("Armored Zombie": 2550 → 2700/0, "Clown Zombie": 2430 → 2565/0, "Dragon Zombie": 2720 → 2880/0). He then Sets "Stop Defense". Bonz tells Joey if he tries to play a monster in  Defense Position , he will activate "Stop Defense" in response which will  switch  Joey's Summoned monster into Attack Position. "Dragon Zombie" attacks and destroys Joey's Set " Tiger Axe " (1300/1100).
 Turn 22: Joey 
Joey draws " Red-Eyes Black Dragon " and subsequently Normal Summons it (2400/2000) in Attack Position. "Red-Eyes Black Dragon" attacks and destroys "Pumpking" (Bonz: 1305 → 855 LP).
 Turn 23: Bonz 
"Dragon Zombie" attacks and destroys "Red-Eyes Black Dragon" (Joey: 630 → 150 LP).
 Turn 24: Joey 
Joey draws " Shield & Sword ". He then Normal Summons " Battle Warrior " (700/1000) in Attack Position. Joey then activates "Shield & Sword" to switch the ATK and DEF of every monster on the field ("Armored Zombie": 2700 → 0/0 → 2700, "Clown Zombie": 2565 → 0/0 → 2565, "Dragon Zombie" 2880 → 0/0 → 2880, "Battle Warrior" 700 → 1000/1000 → 700). "Battle Warrior" attacks and destroys "Dragon Zombie" (Bonz: 855 → 0 LP).
 
 Differences in adaptations 
 The throwing knives used by " Clown Zombie " glow in the international version. 
 Honda  having fangs and veins coursing through his forehead when he is angry that the  huge "boulder" was really a huge balloon is cut out of the US version. 
 In the original, when Keith took away his minions' Star Chips, punching can be heard in the background. In the US version, this is removed. Also, Bonz is given spinning pupils when he's on the ground. 
 Like in the previous episode, " Call of the Haunted " is changed from a  Magic Card  to a  Trap Card  in the US version. 
 Errors 
 When Joey thinks about using " Time Wizard " to win previous Duels, he says that it fossilized  Rex Raptor 's  Dinosaur , when it was actually " Red-Eyes Black Dragon ", which is a  Dragon . 
 When Bonz sets " Stop Defense ", he calls it a Trap Card in the international anime. The reason for this may come from " Defense Paralysis " whose artwork is the same as "Stop Defense". 
 In both versions, when Pumpking is Summoned, its ATK is shown as 1500 rather than 1800. 
 When Joey fails at the effect of "Time Wizard", he loses 900 Life Points, half of "Flame Swordsman's" ATK. This calculation must have ignored the ATK of "Time Wizard", half of which would have been 250, making the total damage 1150, bringing Joey down to 380 Life Points. 
 Trivia 
 This is the only episode in the entire series where "Time Wizard's" Skull effect was activated.
