 Appearance 
 Carlyle has dark-brown hair with lighter-brown bangs, as well as green eyes. He is the first character in  Yu-Gi-Oh! ZEXAL  who is seen wearing the third-year uniform: a white shirt with blue-lined sleeves and collar, a blue tie, blue pants, and a pair of brown shoes. Signifying that he is the student council president, he has a sash around his right arm. Carlyle bears a striking resemblance to  Sylvio Sawatari  from  Yu-Gi-Oh! ARC-V .
 
 Personality 
 His actual personality is quite similar to that of  Caswell Francis 's, sticking to the rules, even before being under  Girag 's control.
 While being brainwashed by Girag, he appears to show jealousy towards  Yuma  due to his popularity for winning the  World Duel Carnival . During his Duel with Yuma, he tried to get Caswell to make exceptions from his rules of the Duel, reminiscent of dirty politics.
 
 Biography 
       Carlyle brainwashed by  Girag .     
 Carlyle was brainwashed by  Girag  along with the rest of the student council. Shortly afterward,  Yuma  replaced  Caswell  as a member of the student council thanks to  Ray Shadows . Caswell was disappointed and Carlyle decided to lure Yuma into a trap by taking advantage of this. He appointed Caswell as the special disciplinarian and Caswell started using his position to harass the other students (even to the point where he was punishing girls for wearing their school uniforms in the Japanese version). This eventually led Yuma to barge into the student council's office and demand that Carlyle do something about Caswell. Carlyle said they should settle it with a duel, but they would have to use the "school rules" ("suspending" monsters with inappropriate clothing by returning them to the hand etc.). Carlyle managed to gain the upperhand with cards to ensure his monsters adhere to the school rules like " Mirror Stage of Discipline ". However, Yuma managed to talk some sense into Caswell and so he stopped enforcing the school rules on their duel, enabling Yuma to win.
 During the  Heartland Academy  Festival, he was overseeing booths that are registered and non-registered. He caught  Flip Turner  with a booth behind the school that was not registered. [2] 
 
 
 Deck 
 Carlyle uses a  Priest Deck . His strategy is centered towards the Summon of his " Norito the Moral Leader ", using his influence over  Caswell Francis , he exploits the school's rulebook to only affect his opponent.
