 Notes 
 In the original Japanese anime, the music in the opening and ending themes changes from  WARRIORS  and  These Overflowing Feelings Don't Stop  to respectively  OVERLAP  and  EYE'S . The Pharaoh's Memories arc, depicted in the new OP and ED sequences, however, do not occur for the next few episodes. 
 
 Yugi's complaint is a little exaggerated, stating he was tired of trying to stop people trying to take over the world. Zigfried only wanted to ruin KC's reputation. 
 The 8 finalists of the KC  Grand Championship  are announced. All Duels take place at the same time. 
 This episode features the beginning of Joey's last Duel of this anime. 
 Round 2 - Quarter-Finals 
 Joey Wheeler  vs.  Zigfried Lloyd 
 Paul McGregor vs. Balfry Ginger 
 Rebecca Hawkins  vs. Abe the Monkey Boy 
 Ethan Shark vs.  Leon Wilson 
 Joey Wheeler vs. Zigfried Lloyd  is the only Duel fully featured in this episode.
 Zigfried  duels under his pseudonym: Zigfried Lloyd. 
 During the Duel, Zigfried's virus is activated again and hacks into the KaibaCorp computer system again, disrupting all the attractions around which the Duels are located. 
 Mistakes 
 In one scene, Duke is missing his wristband
 
 Featured Duel: Joey Wheeler vs. Zigfried Lloyd 
       Joey's bad hand containing "Landstar Shot", "Jinzo", "Red-Eyes Black Dragon", "Graceful Dice", "Polymerization" and "Hyper Refresh".     
 Turn 1: Joey 
 Joey   draws . Joey's hand contains "Landstar Shot", " Jinzo ", " Red-Eyes Black Dragon ", " Graceful Dice ", " Polymerization ", and " Hyper Refresh ". Joey  Sets  a card.
 Turn 2: Zigfried 
 Zigfried  draws " Graceful Charity " and subsequently  activates  it to draw three cards and discard two cards from his  hand . He then Sets a card. Zigfried's hand contains " Valkyrie Erste " and " Valkyrie Zweite ", " Polymerization " and the soon-to-be identified "Nibelung's Ring" and "Fricka's Mediation".
 Turn 3: Joey 
Joey draws " Brigadier of Landstar " and subsequently  Normal Summons  it (900/1200) in  Attack Position . He then activates " Landstar Shot ", equipping it to "Brigadier of Landstar" and increasing its ATK by 600 ("Brigadier of Landstar": 900 → 1500/1200). 
 "Brigadier of Landstar"  attacks   directly , but Zigfried activates his face-down " Wotan's Judgment " to switch the top card of his  Deck  ("Valkyrie Zweite") with a  Magic Card  from his hand ("Nibelung's Ring") in order to  negate  the attack and end the  Battle Phase .
 Turn 4: Zigfried 
Zigfried draws " Pot of Greed " and subsequently activates it to draw 2 cards (an unknown card [Notes 1]  and "Erda's Guidance"). Zigfried then activates " Goddess Erda's Guidance " to discard a Magic Card, [Notes 2]  take a  Trap Card  from his Graveyard, and Set it on his side of the field (which Joey deduces to be "Wotan's Judgment").
 Turn 5: Joey 
Joey draws. He then  Tributes  "Brigadier of Landstar" in order to  Tribute Summon  "Jinzo" (2400/1500) in Attack Position. The effect of "Jinzo" destroys all Trap Cards on the field, so it destroys Zigfried's Set "Wotan's Judgment". "Jinzo" attacks directly (Zigfried 4000 → 1600).
 Turn 6: Zigfried 
Zigfried draws " Ride of The Valkyries " and subsequently activates it.
 Duel concludes next episode.
