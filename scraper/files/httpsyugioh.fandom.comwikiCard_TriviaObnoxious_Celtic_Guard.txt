 This monster is one of the  cover cards  for  Dark Beginning 2 . 
 This card is the  retrained   counterpart  of " Celtic Guardian ".
 The only reason it is not named "Obnoxious Celtic  Guardian " is to avoid further confusion with other " Guardian " monsters (rather than list another monster for " Arsenal Summoner " to exclude). 
 The "Obnoxious" in this card's name may refer to its ability to survive attacks from powerful monsters. 
 This card appears in the artwork of " Brave Attack ". 
 Some French version of this card were misprinted "G u ardien Celtique Recyclé" instead of "Gardien Celtique Recyclé", due to the fact that the English equivalent of "Gardien" is "G u ard" or "G u ardian". 
 This card's artwork is taken from  Yu-Gi-Oh! Duelist  Duel 46: " No Mercy " , specifically from the panel showing " Celtic Guardian " and  Dark Yugi  together (directly after the panel where  Seto Kaiba  is shown prompting Dark Yugi to attack him).
