 During a  Duel , the following items are considered to be  public knowledge  (公開情報  kōkai jōhō ), unless a  card effect  says otherwise (e.g. " Question ").  Duelists  can verify these items at any time and must answer questions involving them truthfully.
 
 Both duelists' current  Life Points . 
 The number of cards in both players'  hands , Decks (this includes the  Main Deck ,  Side Deck , and  Extra Deck ), and  Graveyards , and the number of each player's cards that are  banished . 
 Information printed on a specific, named card, that both duelists can  look  at. Examples: • The  DEF  of a " Sangan " that is  face-up  on the field • The printed effect of a " Soul Exchange " in the Graveyard 
 Both players can look at all face-up cards on the field, cards in the Graveyards, face-up cards in the Extra Decks, and cards that are banished face-up, as well as any card currently being  revealed . If the top card of either player's Main Deck is face-up (due to a card effect), it can also be looked at by both players. 
 Counters Examples: Number of  Spell Counters  on " Skilled Dark Magician " 
 Any notes taken by either Duelist during a Duel Examples: Reminders for " Gold Sarcophagus " 
 Duelists are allowed to pick up and verify the cards in their opponent's Graveyard, face-up banished cards in their opponent's  possession , and face-up cards in their opponent's Extra Deck but the Duelist must ask for permission first. Also, Duelists must not change the order of the cards.
