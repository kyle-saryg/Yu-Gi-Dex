 Imori  is a character in the  first  Yu-Gi-Oh!  anime . He is the anime's incarnation of the  Yu-Gi-Oh!  manga  character  Imori . Unlike in the manga, Imori is portrayed as a victim, corrupted by the  Dragon Block , rather than being vindictive from the start.
 Imori is a student at  Domino High School , who played  Dragon Block  with  Yugi Muto  and  Dark Yugi .
 
 Biography 
 Imori was often bullied by others, which caused him to feel worthless. When  Yugi Muto  saved him from some thugs, they become friends. Later the same bullies knocked the  Dragon Block  out of Imori's hands breaking the seal.  The thug challenges Imori to a game of Dragon Block and Imori wins.  This causes Imori's soul to be corrupted by thoughts of power and revenge against those who have bullied him.  After he makes demands to Yugi that Yugi isn't comfortable keeping he feels betrayed and challenges Yugi to Dragon Block and wins, causing Yugi's soul to be sealed away.  Dark Yugi emerges and beats Imori at Dragon Block thus freeing Yugi's soul.  Unlike in the Manga only the dark side of Imori's soul is sealed away thus leaving the good Imori saved from the Dragon Block's dragons.  Imori then asks Yugi to help him hide the Dragon Block back into its original spot before his father comes home.  They do so and the episode ends.  It can also be presumed that the thug who was sealed away earlier was saved as only one soul can be sealed in the Dragon Block at a time, and Yugi's soul was sealed within it before the Dragons would be able to devour his soul.
