 Voice and mannerisms 
 In both the English and Japanese versions, he inserts French phrases into his speech on occasion. In the latter, he also refers to himself with the archaic and pompous "wagahai," and ends the majority of his sentences with "de aru" (this might be a reference to the japanese book "I am a Cat" [3] ) In the French dub, his name is Wellington instead of Bonaparte, and he is depicted as English, because of his accent and some of his expressions.
 
 Biography 
       Linework     
 Bonaparte is a stout man hailing from Paris, France (in the French dub, he comes from London, and his first name is Wellington). He and Crowler rush to meet  Aster Phoenix , but they became curious why Aster has chosen to enroll, as he already Duels  professionally . His main agenda was initially to try and improve  Duel Academy  as best as he could; although, his actions aren't always in the best interest of some students (such as his repeated attempts at demolishing the  Slifer Red  Dormitory since he felt they were "dragging the school down"). Him and Crowler have tried methods such as making  Chazz Princeton  a star by beating  Reginald Van Howell III  and having  Syrus Truesdale  duel  Missy  to get into the pros. When  Sartorius  arrives to the island, Crowler and Bonaparte rush outside to meet him. They admit that they are big fans of Sartorius and want to show him around the island. But Sartorius tells them he wants to look for new talent alone and leaves them be. His attempts at destroying the Red Dorm were thwarted by  Crowler  (likely because of his new-found respect for  Jaden Yuki ). The two eventually duel to determine the fate of the Slifer Red dorm. Although Bonaparte proves to be a strong duelist, Crowler eventually wins thus saving the Slifer dorm. He is later shown working with the brainwashed Chazz to get rid of the Slifer dorm so that his new white dorm can take its place which fails after Jaden beats  Lorenzo  and  Howard X Miller . While he and Crowler argue about where to go during the field trip, Sartorius tells them that he has a vision of a place where they could go, he has most of the student population backing up his choice. The school ends up going to  Domino City  after Jaden beats  Princess Rose . Later he and Crowler greet Sheppard when he returned to Duel Academy and watch him announce the Genex Tournament. When the  Genex Tournament  is going on, he and Crowler watch  Orlando  Duel Jaden. They are huge fans of his. Later, they call for backup in the form of top students from the past such as  Damon  and  Belowski  who end up beating Pro League duelists  Mathmatica  and  Elroy Prescot  respectively. After they leave, Crowler and Bonaparte beg them to come back and worry about being fired. Once, Bonaparte and Crowler had been led to believe that they had been fired when  Chancellor Sheppard  had shouted at them exclaiming "I want you out, and never come back!" Shortly thereafter, he  Dueled  with Crowler against  Maximillion Pegasus  in an attempt to obtain a job at  Industrial Illusions . During the Duel, Pegasus mislead the two with a more coveted position to the team-mate with the higher  Life Points . Bonaparte immediately starts attacking Crowler in an attempt to get the job (The offer was in fact later revealed to be a ruse, to test the two in eligibility). Eventually after a "pep talk" from Jaden the two agreed to Duel together instead of against each other. Even still they lost the Duel, but Pegasus had agreed they were both welcome to work for him; however, it is then revealed by Sheppard that they had never lost their jobs, and much to their dismay, Pegasus told them to keep their current ones. During the duel against  Doctor Collector  and  The D  he and Crowler tell Jaden and  Hassleberry  that the D was Aster's step father. When the tournament comes to a end, both he and Crowler are beaten by duelists and find out that Chazz freed everyone from the  Society of Light . He then watches  Blair Flannigan  duel Chazz and lose to him making the later the champion.
 During  Thelonious Viper 's  Survival Duels  in the 3rd year, he and Crowler try to tell Sheppard that those duels are causing students off, but the Chancellor brushes off their concerns. Following Duel Academy's arrival in an  alternate dimension  after Jaden defeats Viper, his son  Marcel  had been possessed by the Duel Spirit  Yubel . When he realizes his son's disappearance, he tries at every opportunity to find and rescue him causing the students and Crowler to wonder why he cares so much about Marcel. After the  Three Masked Knights  are beaten by  Jesse Anderson ,  Axel Brodie , and  Jim Crocodile Cook , Bonaparte tells Jaden and Blair that Marcel is his son. After stalling the  Duel Ghouls  to help Jaden get to the  Tennis  courts, he gets turned into one and tries to stop Jaden and co from reaching Marcel alongside Syrus, Chazz and Crowler.  Alexis , Jim,  Bastion  and Hassleberry stay behind to combat them allowing Jaden to get to Marcel. After Marcel gets free from Yubel, he apologized to his son for letting him be easy prey for Yubel. Marcel accepts his father's apology. Previously married, Bonaparte's son is in the custody of his ex-wife, Joséphine. In the fourth season, he resigns his position at Duel Academy in order to spend more time with Marcel.
 His character is based on  Napoleon I .
 
 Deck 
 Bonaparte plays a  Army Deck , which includes cards that detail Napoleon's conquests and coronation, such as the monsters " Toy Soldier " and " Toy Emperor ". His "Toy Soldier" cards are physically weak, but he supplements them through " Forced March " and " Fife and Drum Corps ", as well as a variety of  Trap Cards  to control his opponent's moves and protect his monsters. His Deck relies on weakening the opponent's  Life Points  while strengthening his own with " Unequal Treaty " until he can Summon his strongest monster, aforementioned "Toy Emperor".
