 " Chronomaly ", known as " OOPArts " ( 先史遺産   Ōpātsu  or 오파츠  Opacheu ) in Japan or Korea, is an  archetype  of  EARTH  and  LIGHT   monsters  used by  Trey  in the  Yu-Gi-Oh! ZEXAL  anime. Their effects  support  each other well, enabling quick  swarming  and  Xyz Summons  of  Rank  5  Xyz Monsters , particularly through the LIGHT monsters.

 Design 
 Appearance 
 Most "Chronomaly" monsters are based on and resemble various artifacts.
 
 Etymology 
 The  OCG  name, "OOPArts", is an acronym for " Out-Of-Place Artifact ", a term used to describe artifacts that make no logical sense given the technology available at the time they were created. Such objects were also featured as part of the " Ancient Treasure "  series  in the  Yu-Gi-Oh! 5D's  anime. The  TCG  name, "Chronomaly", is a portmanteau of the word "chronology" which is the sequential order in which past events occur and "anomaly" as in an irregularity or something odd. Put together these monsters are "chronological anomalies" or "chronomalies" since these objects deviate from what would have been possible to create given the resources and technology available at that time.

 Playing style 
 "Chronomaly" monsters are focused on  Xyz Summoning  a wide range of  Xyz Monsters , ranging from Rank 3 to Rank 6. Many of their effects allow  Special Summoning  of more "Chronomaly" monsters and manipulating the opponent's monsters attack points. 
 Chronomaly Nebra Disk  is the main searcher of the deck as it allows to add any "Chronomaly" card from your deck to your hand upon being Normal Summoned. It also revives itsel at the cost of only controlling "Chronomaly" monsters and being able to activate solely "Chronomaly" cards for the rest of the turn. This effect combos well with  Chronomaly Tuspa Rocket  which is a one card " Foolish Burial " (both from deck or extra deck) that also weakens an opponent's monster while also increasing the number of attacks a Number xyz monster summoned with this card as material can perform.
 Chronomaly Moai  and  Chronomaly Moai Carrier  are the main free special summons of the deck, being able to be summoned easily by fullfilling little conditions (Chronomaly Moai can be special summoned when a Chronomaly is on the field, while Moai Carrier is effectively the " Cyber Dragon " of the archetype). Similarly,  Chronomaly Aztec Mask Golem  can be special summoned for free if a Chronomaly spell card has been used on the same turn. 
 Chronomaly Crystal Skull  is the main monster searcher of the deck, being able to be discarded if a Chronomaly is on the field to add a Chronomaly Monster from deck or Graveyard to the hand, while  Chronomaly Crystal Bones  can effectively be used to special summon a Chronomaly from Hand or Gy.
 Chronomaly Gordian Knot  allows to special summon a Chronomaly from the hand by copying its level while  Chronomaly Sol Monolith  is the only monster that gives access to  Number 6: Chronomaly Atlandis .

 Chronomaly OTK 
 This Deck focuses on using the effects of " Number 33: Chronomaly Machu Mech " and " Number 36: Chronomaly Chateau Huyuk " to perform a  One Turn Kill .
 What you need:
 
 Four monsters in your field (two needs to be Level 5 and the others Level 4) 
 "Number 33: Chronomaly Machu Mech" and "Number 36: Chronomaly Chateau Huyuk" in the Extra Deck 
 Your opponent has a monster with 1800 or more  ATK 
 How it works:
 
 The four monsters you need are: two Level 5 to Summon "Chronomaly Machu Mech" and another two Level 4 to Summon "Chronomaly Chateau Huyuk":
 You can Special Summon " Chronomaly Crystal Bones " with its own effect, use its effect to Summon " Chronomaly Golden Jet " (and use its effect to increase its Level), Normal Summon " Chronomaly Nebra Disk " to search " Chronomaly Moai " or " Chronomaly Tula Guardian " and then Special Summon it with its own effect
 Remember that you cannot use " Chronomaly Technology " and Special Summon non-"Chronomaly" monsters in the same turn. 
 Xyz Summon "Chronomaly Machu Mech" using the two Level 5 monsters and "Chronomaly Chateau Huyuk" using the two Level 4 monsters. 
 Activate the effect of "Chronomaly Chateau Huyuk",  target  1 of your opponent's monsters with at least 1800 ATK. The targeted monster's ATK becomes 0.
 All following calculations will be done with the assumption that that monster had exactly 1800 ATK. 
 Use the effect of "Chronomaly Machu Mech" on the monster that was targeted by the effect of "Chronomaly Chateau Huyuk" to inflict 1800 effect damage to your opponent. Then "Chronomaly Machu Mech" gains ATK equal to the amount of damage inflicted. This makes its total ATK 4200. 
 Enter the  Battle Phase  and  attack  your opponent's monster that was targeted by "Chronomaly Chateau Huyuk", then attack directly dealing a total of 6000 damage. 
 1800 (the first effect of "Chronomaly Machu Mech") + 4200 (the ATK of "Chronomaly Machu Mech") + 2000 (the ATK of "Chronomaly Chateau Huyuk") = 8000 damage
 Notes: 
 
 Each copy of " Chronomaly Pyramid Eye Tablet " gives ATK + 800 to both "Numbers", allowing the combo to work with monsters with ATK less than 1800. 
 If you don't have "Chronomaly Chateau Huyuk", you can use " Mini-Guts ", " Chronomaly Cabrera Trebuchet ", " Gorgonic Guardian " or other card that  reduces ATK to 0  as a Plan B.

 Weaknesses 
 Since most "Chronomaly" cards involve swarming, mass-removal cards like " Dark Hole ", " Torrential Tribute " and " Deck Devastation Virus " can interdict "Chronomaly" monsters before they have a chance to infest the field with the latter-most aforementioned card perhaps being the deadliest to this Deck due to the card's lingering effect and all the non-Xyz "Chronomaly" monsters (except " Winged Sphinx ") sporting 1500 or less  ATK . " Light-Imprisoning Mirror " also poses a threat to their swarming and effects, as most "Chronomaly" monsters have LIGHT as their Attribute.  However, " Mind Drain " can be worse in countering their  Special Summoning  as a lot of key Level 5 "Chronomaly" monsters (i.e. " Moai " and " Moai Carrier ") are helpful in Xyz Summoning " Machu Mech ".
 In addition, cards like " Summon Limit ", " Narrow Pass " and any cards that render  Monster Card Zones  useless (i.e. " Ground Collapse ") can bar them from the  field  completely (" Summon Breaker " can also flat-out pause a spamming "Chronomaly" player's turn completely). In fact, these countermeasures, combined with anti-Special Summoning support, can almost completely shut down "Chronomaly" Decks. Finally, most "Chronomaly" monsters have scanty  DEF —if "Chronomaly" Duelists go on the defensive,  Defense Position -destroying card effects and  piercing  cards can be added boon against "Chronomaly" Decks. If you want to go on the defensive use " Giant Soldier of Steel " in your  Extra Deck  against burns and monsters with 1900 or more ATK.
 
 Trivia 
 All of this archetype's members are either  Machine  or  Rock  monsters, except for the  Psychic  " Chronomaly Crystal Chrononaut ".
