 Summary 
 Even after losing her " Queen Angel of Roses ",  Akiza  doesn't give up, and reveals her trump card! However,  Kalin  shows himself indifferent, and crushes her last hope, taking the "queen" down...!
 
 Featured Duel: Akiza Izinski vs. Kalin Kessler 
 Duel continues from  the previous Ride . 
 Turn 8: Akiza 
The  effect  of " Queen Angel of Roses "  activates  and  destroys  itself. Akiza activates " Prayer to the Evil Spirits ", using "Queen Angel of Roses" from her  Graveyard  and " Fallen Angel of Roses " from her  hand  to  Fusion Summon  " Rosaria, the Stately Fallen Angel " (2900/2400) in  Attack Position [Notes 1] . Akiza activates its effect,  negating  the effects of all other cards on the  field . Akiza  attacks  and destroys " Infernity General " with "Rosaria, the Stately Fallen Angel" (Kalin: 1200 → 1000). She  Sets  1 card.
 Turn 9: Kalin 
Kalin  Normal Summons  " Infernity Sage " (400/800). He activates the effect of "Infernity General",  banishing  itself from the Graveyard in order to  Special Summon  " Infernity Shield Bearer " (0/1100) and " Infernity Spear Bearer " (1100/0) from the Graveyard with their effects negated. He then tunes "Infernity Sage", "Infernity Shield Bearer" and "Infernity Spear Bearer" to  Synchro Summon  " Void Ogre Dragon " (3000/3000) in Attack Position. Kalin attacks "Rosaria, the Stately Fallen Angel", but Akiza activates her  face-down  " Rose Barrier Force " to banish "Fallen Angel of Roses" in an attempt to destroy "Void Ogre Dragon". " Void Cauldron " prevents it from getting destroyed, but Akiza activates " Briar Transplant " to banish "Void Cauldron". Kalin activates the effect of "Void Ogre Dragon", negating "Briar Transplant" and in doing so gains 500 ATK (ATK: 3000 → 3500). [Notes 2]  The attack resumes and "Rosaria, the Stately Fallen Angel" is destroyed (Akiza: 500 → 0).
