 " Yujin and the Sea " is the fifty-fifth episode of the  Yu-Gi-Oh! SEVENS  anime. It first aired in Japan on July 4, 2021.
 The sound of a steam whistle echoes across Goha 7th Elementary School, signaling the arrival of a cruiser with  Yujin Goha  on board. He's the second eldest brother of the Goha Siblings and a self-proclaimed "man of the sea". Using his power as a president of Goha, he turns the schoolyard into the sea, and commences a  Duel  in the middle of it. Since Yuga isn't good at swimming,  Luke  volunteers to take his place!
 
 Featured Duel: Tatsuhisa "Luke" Kamijo VS. Yujin Goha 
 The duel is conducted as a  Rush Duel .
