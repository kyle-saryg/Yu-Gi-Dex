 Holactie the Creator of Light [2] [3]  or simply  The Creator of Light , known as  Horakhty, the Creator God of Light  in the Japanese version, is a character version of the card " Holactie the Creator of Light ", appearing in the  Yu-Gi-Oh!  anime .
 She is the merger of the three Egyptian Gods:  The Winged Dragon of Ra ,  Slifer the Sky Dragon , and  Obelisk the Tormentor .
 
 History 
 Just as  Zorc Necrophades  was about to launch an attack against Yugi and his friends, Atem used his powers to summon the three  Egyptian Gods  before fusing them to bring out the Creator of Light. 
 Holactie destroyed Zorc with just one light-related attack. The Creator of Light later spoke to Atem directly, saying that it was his friends who had helped him remember his long-forgotten name. She also revealed that this was the final evil that Atem and his friends would have to face together meaning there was one task left before fading away as Yugi prepared to help the pharaoh return to the afterlife.
