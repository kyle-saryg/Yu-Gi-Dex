 Professor Frank , simply known as  The Professor  in the dub, is one of  Goodwin 's 5  Dueling Assassins  placed in the Fortune Cup with the intent of exposing the  Signers , as well a member of  Iliaster .
 In the Japanese version, Professor Frank has a catchphrase "sa", which he says 3 times. "Sa" is used in Japanese to beckon somebody. In the dub, this is replaced by a constant usage of analogy and simile, both regular and homeric.

 Biography 
 His first match is unseen, but it is mentioned that he lost to  Commander Koda  on purpose, specifically so he could be in the consolation game. In the Duel, he hypnotizes Luna, then enters a trance that allows him access to the  Duel Spirit dimension  (specifically, the " Ancient Forest "). 
 His mere presence appears to be able to destroy the forest. As such, the forest's guardian,  Ancient Fairy Dragon , attempts to kill him to save its home; Luna ends the  Duel  in a  DRAW  to save him.
 
       Frank vs. Luna     
 It was shown that he intended to be the ruler of the Spirit World by defeating Luna. He is also a bit self-centered, shown that he decided to keep the Spirit World to himself and will not share it with Goodwin and the other Iliaster members. It was also said by the professor himself that he has been spending his whole entire life looking for the Spirit World (all of that was only in the dub, however; he showed no treachery towards the other Iliaster members or desire to rule the Spirit World in the original version). He is also slightly insane as he laughed like a maniac, not noticing that Ancient Fairy Dragon tried to kill him.
 Following the Duel, Professor Frank succeeds in his mission, but it is unknown as to the state of his mind. Professor Frank also spilled some information about Goodwin's goals and the Signers to Luna during the Duel.
 
 Abilities 
 He is capable of hypnotizing someone via his  Trap Card  " Light to the Depths ", and even having his voice reach the Duel Monster Spirit world, much like how Leo has spoken to Luna various times despite not being there some of the times. His mere presence was enough to threaten the Duel Monster Spirit World before Luna forced him out of her mind. [1] [2] 
 
 Deck 
 Frank plays a  Psychoanalysis-themed Disruption Deck  whose cards are based off various aspects of the  Eponymous School of Thought  as seen with the cornerstone card, " Ido the Supreme Magical Force ". These cards have various effects from  revealing  opponent's cards to  effect damage .
