 This monster appears in the artworks of " Xyz Double Back ", " Xyz Reception ", " Xyz Import ", " Black and White Wave " and " Overtake Summon ". 
 This card is the  DARK  counterpart of " Tiras, Keeper of Genesis ".
 This card is also the first  Dark counterpart   Xyz Monster . 
 This card was the first  TCG exclusive  Xyz Monster. 
 If one looks closely, it is possible to see a modern city as this card's background. This might suggest that our modern civilization is close to an end.
 This theory can be proven with its LIGHT counterpart, "Tiras, Keeper of Genesis", whose background features an ancient/historical city, which can be interpreted as the beginning of civilization (Genesis - beginning). 
 The  Generation Force  Spanish print of this card showed the word "monstruos" (" monsters ") with a capital letter. This mistake was corrected in the  BP01  print.
