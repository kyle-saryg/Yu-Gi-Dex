 Biography 
 History 
 Sam was employed by  Sector Security  and the  High Council  of the  Synchro Dimension . However, he refused to make eye contact with his peers or give his opinion. On one occasion, he met  Jack Atlas  at an event and he explained that he was a fan of his. Jack gave him a card, " Tuning Magician ", which he explained suited Sam. Sam interpreted this as an insult, given the card's low  Level , 0  ATK , and its effect. [2] 
 
 Friendship Cup 
 When  Yuya  tried to talk to Sam about  Jack Atlas  before the exhibition match of the  Friendship Cup , he was nervous and didn't realize Yuya was talking to him despite being the only other one in the room. [1]  After Yuya's defeat, he gave Yuya " Tuning Magician ", believing the latter could defeat Jack. [2] . Sam was later present during Yuya's discussion with  Declan  regarding  Riley . [3] 
 
 Friendship Cup Finals 
       Sam angry at  Yuya .     
 Sam watched the Duel between Yuya and  Shinji . He was surprised to see Yuya use the card he gave him, "Tuning Magician", to Synchro Summon " Enlightenment Paladin " and win the Duel with it. [4]  Although he was overjoyed when Yuya won, he was shocked when Shinji and the Commons painted Yuya as an ally of the Topsiders and he started to distrust Yuya, especially due to the untimely arrival of  Jean-Michel Roget . [5] 
 Before the semifinals match, Sam talked to Jack about how he finally understood why Jack gave him "Tuning Magician". He also learned from Jack that all cards and people had a purpose and was given the task of delivering this message to Yuya. [6]  Sam went to look for Yuya to tell him that Jack was not impressed with his Duel with  Crow . Jack also instructed Sam to tell Yuya, if that wasn't the Duel he truly believed in, to come to the  Duel Palace  and challenge him to a Duel. He then returned to the Duel Palace with Yuya,  Gong ,  Frank ,  Amanda , and  Tarren , but they couldn't get in due to the  Commons  blocking the entrance during their riot. Just then  Shay ,  Chojiro ,  Sylvio ,  Declan , and  Riley  appeared while riding Shay's " Raidraptors ". They rode on with them to the Duel Palace, where Yuya challenged Jack Atlas to a Duel. [7] 
 
 Duel Academy 
 After  Z-ARC 's defeat, Sam is seen watching  Yuya 's Duel against  Jack  with  Shinji ,  Damon ,  Tony ,  Amanda ,  Frank ,  Tarren ,  Chojiro , and his lackeys. [8]  He was happy when Yuya won and then watched Yuya and  Declan 's  Action Duel . [9]  He was happy when Yuya won and was sent to the  Pendulum Dimension  by  Ray Akaba  to witness  Zuzu 's revival. [10]
