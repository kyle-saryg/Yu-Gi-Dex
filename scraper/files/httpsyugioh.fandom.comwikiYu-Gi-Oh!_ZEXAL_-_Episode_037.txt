 "Double Jeopardy: Part 1" , known as " Disqualified from the WDC!? Heartland's Assassins, Droite and Gauche " in the Japanese version, is the thirty-seventh episode of the  Yu-Gi-Oh! ZEXAL  anime. It first aired in Japan on December 26, 2011 and in the United States on November 10, 2012.
 In order to prevent  Flip  from being disqualified from the  WDC ,  Yuma  Duels against  Dextra  and  Nistro . Meanwhile,  Astral  faces against  an old enemy  inside  Emperor's Key .
 
 Summary 
   This summary is currently incomplete. 
 On the second day of the  WDC ,  Flip  falls down from a tree and wakes himself up, after he separated with  Yuma  and the others. He was hiding in a tree in order to analyze the other duelists but fell asleep. He decides to collect  Heart Pieces  but realizes that it's the second day and only strong people remain, and if he loses he'd lose his only Heart Piece. He then thinks of an idea. Elsewhere, as Yuma is talking to  Tori  and fits his 4th Heart Piece into its container, he then notices that  Astral  isn't around him, and he's in the  ship  within the  Emperor's Key  wondering what he is. Elsewhere Flip is collecting Heart Pieces using his "tricky ideas" and even takes  Spencer 's Heart Piece and in return he can choose any number of pieces he wants from Flip's bag.
 Spencer ends up getting disqualified from the WDC because the Heart Pieces Flip gave him were fake (they were candy). Flip then goes to see  Nistro  to qualify into the next round, and Nistro tells him to lick his Heart Pieces. Flip licks it, says it's candy and tell Nistro he was tricked, but Nistro doesn't believe him and ties him up with rope. Then Yuma and Tori arrive and  Dextra  recognizes Yuma as "the noisy little boy". Nistro reveals that as punishment for fabricating Heart Pieces his Deck will be confiscated, he will be disqualified from the WDC and he would be deprived of all future participation in the WDC for the rest of his life. Nistro also says he will make sure he never duels again by beating him out of Heartland City.
 Knowing this, Yuma decides to Duel against him but instead Dextra agrees for a 2-on-1 match. If Yuma wins, Dextra and Nistro will forget what Flip did and leave him alone, but if Yuma loses he takes Flip's punishment, which Yuma accepts. Meanwhile, Astral is still in The Emperor's Key, and notices Yuma is starting a duel. He goes to help him but is stopped by  Number 96  who has broke free with the help of the other " Numbers " (excluding "Utopia"). Astral asks why are the other "Numbers" helping him, and Number 96 says that all "Numbers" want destruction.
 The Duel begins, and Astral is still inside the Key so Yuma couldn't use the Numbers. Number 96 asks Astral to remember his mission, and to come to their side. He is then attacked by him, but  Number 39: Utopia  appears and protects Astral, and Number 96 then asks Utopia if he is standing against them. He then summons his true form, "Number 96: Dark Mist", and says that he'll absorb him. Back at the Duel, Dextra has destroyed both Yuma's monsters and he is now down to 2400  LP . It is now Nistro's turn, and he attacks Yuma directly with " Hammer Bounzer ". Luckily, Yuma's got a plan. He  Special Summons  " Gagaga Gardna " in  Attack Position  and uses its effect and  discards  a card but he's still hit with damage. Yuma is now at 1000 LP, and Nistro then uses " Blade Bounzer " to attack "Gagaga Gardna". Yuma then discards a card but still takes damage, and as Nistro uses the effect of "Blade Bounzer" to discard a card to attack again, Yuma discards the last card in his hand to protect his monster but is still hit with damage. Nistro then uses the effect of "Blade Bounzer" again but Yuma has no cards in his hand, and he's nearly out of monsters on his field and LP.
 
 Featured Duel: Yuma Tsukumo vs Dextra and Nistro 
 This is a 2 vs. 1  Duel . Should either  Nistro  or  Dextra  lose, their team loses.
 Turn 1: Yuma 
 Yuma  draws a  monster  and subsequently  Sets  it. He then sets a card.
 Turn 2: Dextra 
 Dextra  draws. She then  Normal Summons  " Morpho Butterspy " ( 4/1200/1600) in Attack Position and Sets two cards.
 Turn 3: Nistro 
Nistro draws. As  Nistro   controls  no cards while Yuma controls cards, Nistro  Special Summons  " Hammer Bounzer " ( 6/2300/2000) from his  hand  in  Attack Position  via its own  effect . 
 Turn 4: Yuma 
Yuma's hand contains " Attraffic Control ", " Wonder Wand ", "Overlay Eater", and "Gagaga Gardna". Yuma  draws  "Tasuke Knight". Yuma  Flip Summons  " Rai Rider " ( 3/1200/1400) and Normal Summons " Tasuke Knight " ( 4/1700/100) in Attack Position. "Tasuke Knight"  attacks  "Morpho Butterspy", but Dextra  activates  her  face-down  " Butterflyoke ", switching "Tasuke Knight" to  Defense Position  and  equipping  "Butterflyoke" to it.
 Turn 5: Dextra 
Dextra draws " Swallowtail Butterspy " and subsequently Normal Summons it ( 4/1800/1200) in Attack Position. Dextra activates the second effect of "Butterflyoke", changing "Tasuke Knight" to Attack Position. Since the battle position of one of Yuma's monsters was changed, Dextra activates the effect of "Morpho Butterspy", decreasing the  ATK  and  DEF  of "Tasuke Knight" by 1000 ("Tasuke Knight": 1700 →700/100 → 0). 
 "Morpho Butterspy" attacks and  destroys  "Tasuke Knight (Yuma: 4000 → 3500 LP). As another monster inflicted  Battle Damage  to Yuma, Dextra activates the effect of "Swallowtail Butterspy", decreasing the ATK of "Rai Rider" by the amount of damage that was inflicted ("Rai Rider": 1200 → 700 ATK). "Swallowtail Butterspy" attacks and destroys "Rai Rider" (Yuma: 3500 → 2400 LP). As "Rai Rider"  battled , its effect activates, meaning that "Swallowtail Butterspy" may not attack next turn. Dextra Sets a card.
 Turn 6: Nistro 
Nistro draws " Blade Bounzer " and subsequently Normal Summons it ( 4/1800/1400) in Attack Position. "Hammer Bounzer" attacks  directly . Nistro explains that since he controls no Spell or Trap Cards when "Hammer Bounzer" attacked, Yuma is forbidden from activating Spells and Traps until the end of the Damage Step. Yuma activates the effect of " Gagaga Gardna " to Special Summon it ( 4/1500/2000) in Attack Position since he is being attacked directly. A  replay  occurs and Nistro uses "Hammer Bounzer" to attack "Gagaga Gardna", but Yuma activates the second effect of "Gagaga Gardna",  discarding  " Overlay Eater " in order to prevent its  destruction by battle  (Yuma: 2400 → 1600 LP). 
 "Blade Bounzer" attacks "Gagaga Gardna", but Yuma activates the second effect of "Gagaga Gardna", discarding a card to prevent its destruction by battle (Yuma: 1600 → 1300 LP). Nistro activates the effect of "Blade Bounzer" to allow it to attack again by discarding " Copy Knight ". "Blade Bounzer" attacks "Gagaga Gardna", but Yuma activates the second effect of "Gagaga Gardna", discarding the last card in his hand to prevent its destruction by battle (Yuma: 1300 → 1000 LP). Nistro activates the effect of "Blade Bounzer", discarding a card to allow it to attack again.
 Duel continues in  the next episode .
