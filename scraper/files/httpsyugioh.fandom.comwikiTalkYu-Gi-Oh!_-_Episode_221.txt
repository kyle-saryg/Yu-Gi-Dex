 Quotes 
 Is there any particular reason this article is directly quoting the anime? That doesn't really say "summary" to me. Aside from that, there's the possibility of dialogue changes between the versions.  Cheesedude  ( talk  •  contribs ) 06:10, August 17, 2010 (UTC)
 
 It seems like most of this arc's articles are written this way, so I'd assume it's just the prefence of whoever wrote the articles. Regardless, anyone have an opinion on this?  Cheesedude  ( talk  •  contribs ) 06:19, August 17, 2010 (UTC)
 I wrote all those pages this way Cheesedude. It was quicker to write in note form and quote dialogue, than to post an actual summary. I'm sure the readers enjoy the extra info. That said feel free to move all the dialogue into a section called "Excerpts" and to write a real summary of your own.  (-- Mpanty  ( talk ) 06:25, August 17, 2010 (UTC))
 Fair enough.  Cheesedude  ( talk  •  contribs ) 08:22, August 17, 2010 (UTC) 
 Stone 
 How did the Stone appear if it was  shattered  in Dawn of the Duel, when Zorc emerged?  Scheepybird  ( talk  •  contribs ) 13:52, September 5, 2015 (UTC)
