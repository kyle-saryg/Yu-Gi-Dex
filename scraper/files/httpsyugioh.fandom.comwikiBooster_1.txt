 Booster 1  was released on March 1,  1999  as one of the very first  Booster Packs  in the  Yu-Gi-Oh! Official Card Game —preceded only by  Vol.1 , which was released the month prior. Like all  Series 1  sets,  Booster 1  cards used the  Series 1 card layout , distinguished from later layouts by the lack of a  Card Number  beneath the card's artwork and the  Eye of Anubis Hologram  in its lower-right corner. Like the other  Booster  sets,  Booster 1  was distributed via  Carddass  vending machines.
 Five of the cards in this set were reprinted from  Vol.1 ; the other 35 cards were introduced to the  OCG  in this set, two of which it introduced to the entire franchise. All but 17 of the cards have been reprinted in Japanese, and only 14 of them have been printed in the  Yu-Gi-Oh! Trading Card Game    and 25 have never been printed in the tcg.
