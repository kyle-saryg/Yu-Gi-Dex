 This card can be kept in the Side Deck for almost any Deck capable of Summoning a  Rank 4   Xyz Monster , as its effect is most effective going first against a combo strategy that relies on Graveyard setup to do their plays.
 Xyz Summoning  this card with 2 Level 4  WATER  monsters allows you to retain the ATK boost even after one use of its effect. 
 This card also stops  floating  effects of most monsters. 
 Using " Atlantean Dragoons " as a Material can give this card the ATK boost, and also get to search for any  Sea Serpent -Type monster from your Deck when its effect is activated.
