 How to Fusion Summon 
 A player can Fusion Summon a Fusion Monster from the Extra Deck by  activating  a card or effect that performs a Fusion Summon. When that effect resolves, the player uses appropriate  Fusion Materials  listed on a Fusion Monster by moving them from some location(s) to another location, as specified by the effect performing the Fusion Summon (usually  sending  them to the  Graveyard ; as in the  implicit  case of " Polymerization " and other effects stating "using monsters as Fusion Materials"). After that, the player Summons the Fusion Monster from the  Extra Deck  to an unoccupied  Main Monster Zone  or an  Extra Monster Zone  in  face-up   Attack  or  Defense Position .
 Even if all appropriate Monster Zones are occupied, a Fusion Monster can still be Fusion Summoned as long as at least one of the Fusion Materials used is in one of these Zones, so that there is an available Zone when the Fusion Monster is Summoned.

 Main article:  Performs a Fusion Summon 
 
 Example 
 Example A: Normal method with " Polymerization " 
 " Polymerization " + A  Fusion Material (" Dark Magician ") + A  Fusion Material (" Buster Blader ") = A  Fusion Monster (" Dark Paladin ") 
 Example B: Using Fusion Substitutes 
 " Polymerization " + A  Fusion Substitute Monster (" King of the Swamp ", used in place of " Elemental HERO Flame Wingman ") + a correct Fusion Material (" Elemental HERO Sparkman ") = A non- strict Fusion Summon   Fusion Monster (" Elemental HERO Shining Flare Wingman ") 
 Example C: Using a monster as both a Fusion Material and to conduct a Fusion Summon 
 A Fusion Material with an effect that Fusion Summons (" D/D Swirl Slime ") + A Fusion Material (" D/D Berfomet ") = A  Fusion Monster (" D/D/D Flame King Genghis ") 
 Effects 
 Like other Extra Deck monsters, if a Fusion Monster is not Fusion Summoned first, it cannot be  Special Summoned  from the  Graveyard  or while  banished  (unless it specifies another way to properly Special Summon it, in which case it must first be Summoned that way).
 
 Anime 
 While visual depictions of Fusion Summons have varied significantly among the different anime series, most generally show the Fusion Materials, or their cards, being warped into particles or forms of energy in a spiral direction, which then merge with each other within a spiraling portal, from which the Fusion Monster emerges. It is not until  Yu-Gi-Oh! ARC-V  where a standardized version of this method is adopted for all Fusion Summons, with the portal consisting of blue and orange swirls of energy, referencing the artwork of "Polymerization", and the Fusion Material Monsters transforming into differently colored forms of energy (usually the colors being contrasting ones like blue/red, yellow/violet, etc.), which then swirl together into a spiral before entering the portal. Fusion Summon practitioners usually clasp their hands together at the moment the monsters combine, seemingly mirroring that the materials become one.
 Prior to  ARC-V , another depiction of Fusion Summon, notably used for " Dark Paladin " and " Dragon Knight Draco-Equiste ", shows the Fusion Materials being engulfed in a sphere of energy, which then disperses to reveal the Fusion Monster. Other times, the Fusion Monster emerges from a fierce whirlwind.
 In  Yu-Gi-Oh! VRAINS , when a Fusion Summon is performed, the Fusion Materials turns into streams of colored particles gathering at a singular point, which bursts into multiple colored vortexes. The vortexes then combine into one, and become a single color, and the particles assemble into the Fusion Monster [1] . For each Fusion Material, there are always red and blue vortex, and additional color are added for each added Material, starting with green, and then yellow.
 In the  Yu-Gi-Oh!  anime , under  Battle City Rules , which applied during the  Battle City  tournament,  Fusion Monsters  cannot  attack  the same  turn  they are Summoned. This is exemplified in  episode 65 , when  Strings  uses " Quick Attack " on " Humanoid Worm Drake " to bypass that rule in his  Duel  against  Yami Yugi . This rule does not exist in the  OCG / TCG  and was removed for all subsequent series.
 In  Yu-Gi-Oh! ARC-V , a Fusion Summon performed using Fusion Materials that have been previously  Pendulum Summoned  is referred to as a "Pendulum-Fusion".

 Trivia 
 To date, Fusion Summoning has been featured in every  Yu-Gi-Oh!  series ( Duel Monsters ,  GX ,  5D'S ,  ZEXAL ,  ARC-V , and  VRAINS ).
 A variant of  Fusion Summon  is also featured in Rush Duel and  Yu-Gi-Oh! SEVENS .
