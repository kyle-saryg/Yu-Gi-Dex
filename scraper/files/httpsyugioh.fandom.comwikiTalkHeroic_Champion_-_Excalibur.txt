 i don't think this card's name should have a dash in it. I think it's used to distinguish from the  Heroic  monsters. Okay, you got two kinds of Heroic monsters: Challenger and Champion. They're both abbreviated as HC, but one with a dot is Challenger, and the one with a dash is Champion. So what if there's a dash, if there was a dot instead, it would be named Heroic Challenger Excalibur. I could be wrong later when it's tcg, but for now, i think it doesn't need a dash.

 I agree, this is quite similar to the situation between the Japanese names of  Elemental HERO  and  Evil HERO .  「 ディノ 奴 千？！ 」 ?  ·  ☎ Dinoguy1000  05:36, February 28, 2012 (UTC) 
 Huh, i didn't know that. Well, my point may be proven.  LastMinute  ( talk  •  contribs ) 05:40, February 28, 2012 (UTC) 
 According to the tin, there's a dash. -- Golden Key  ( talk  •  contribs ) 11:53, May 10, 2012 (UTC) 
 According to the tin, " Number 17: Leviathan Dragon " was "Number 17: Leviath Dragon", so tins aren't always perfect, but there wouldn't be much against moving it anyways since tins are still official. 
 Then again even if it was correct in this case, there's no reason for why the TCG can't ignore the OCG and use dashes for both. "Heroic Challenger - ..." and "Heroic Champion - ..."

 Yes, the "Leviath" issue is why I didn't change Excalibur's page. -- Golden Key  ( talk  •  contribs ) 13:37, May 10, 2012 (UTC) 
 Before, this card used to be called, "Heroic - Champion Excalibur" as someone followed the kanji. This is a different matter. lol, just one word over.  LastMinute  ( talk  •  contribs ) 07:39, May 13, 2012 (UTC)
