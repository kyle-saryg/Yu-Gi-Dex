After escaping from Bohman's program, Ai entrusts his, as well as the other Ignises', final hopes and wishes to  Playmaker . And now, the battle between Bohman and Playmaker enters its final phase. The future of mankind and AI all depends on this battle...
 
 Featured Duel: Playmaker vs. Bohman 
 Duel continues from the previous episode . 
 Turn 6: Playmaker 
As he controls no monsters, Playmaker discards " Dotscaper " to Special Summon " Threshold Borg " (2400/1400) from his hand via its own effect. As it was sent to the  GY , Playmaker Special Summons "Dotscaper" (0/2100) via its own effect. He then activates " Cynet Codec ", which lets him add a  Cyberse  monster from his Deck to his hand whenever he Special Summons a " Code Talker " monster from his Extra Deck, as long as both monsters have the same  Attribute . He uses "Threshold Borg" and "Dotscaper" to  Link Summon  " Code Talker " (1300/LINK-2/↑↓). The effect of "Cynet Codec" activates and Playmaker adds the  DARK  " Micro Coder ". as he would Link Summon a "Code Talker" monster, the effect of "Micro Coder" allows him to use it as Link Material from the hand, so he uses "Micro Coder" and "Code Talker" to Link Summon " Encode Talker " (2300/LINK-3/↑↓↘). 
 The effect of "Cynet Codec" activates and Playmaker adds the  LIGHT  " Cyberse Gadget ". As "Micro Coder" was sent to the GY as Link Material for the summon of a "Code Talker" monster, its effect lets Playmaker add a " Cynet " Spell/Trap Card from his Deck to his hand. Playmaker adds " Cynet Optimization ". He then  Normal Summons  "Cyberse Gadget" (1400/300). As it was Normal Summoned, Playmaker activates the effect of "Cyberse Gadget" to Special Summon a Level 2 or lower monster from his GY with its effects negated. He Special Summons "Micro Coder" (300/0), then uses "Encode Talker" and "Micro Coder" to Link Summon " Cyberse Witch " (800/LINK-2/↙↓). He then activates the effect of " SIMM Tablir " from his hand, adding " Clock Wyvern " from his GY to his hand in order to Special Summon itself (0/1800) to one of the zones "Witch" points to. As a monster was Special Summoned to a zone it points to, the effect of "Witch" lets Playmaker banish a Spell Card from his GY to add 1 Cyberse Ritual Monster and " Cynet Ritual " from his Deck to his hand. He banishes " Cynet Fusion " and adds " Cyberse Magician " and "Cynet Ritual". As he activated its first effect this turn, the other effect of "Witch" lets Playmaker Special Summon a Level 4 or lower Cyberse from his GY, he Special Summons " Widget Kid " (1500/900). As "Widget Kid" was Special Summoned, Playmaker activates its effect, Special Summoning a Cyberse monster from his hand in Defense Position. He Special Summons "Clock Wyvern" (1800/1000). 
 Playmaker then activates "Cynet Ritual", tributing the Level 3 "Widget Kid" and the Level 5 "SIMM Tablir" to  Ritual Summon  the Level 7 "Cyberse Magician" (2500/2000) from his hand. He then  overlays  his Level 4 "Cyberse Gadget" and "Clock Wyvern" to  Xyz Summon  " Firewall eXceed Dragon " (2500/2000). He then uses "eXceed Dragon" and "Witch" to Link Summon " Transcode Talker " (2300/LINK-3/↑→↓). The effect of "Cynet Codec" activates and Playmaker adds the  EARTH  " Code Generator ". He then activates the  Continuous Spell  "Cynet Optimization", letting him Normal Summon 1 Cyberse Monster during his Main Phase. He Normal Summons "Code Generator" (1300/500). He uses "Cyberse Magician", "Transcode Talker" and "Code Generator" to Link Summon " Firewall Dragon Darkfluid " (3000/LINK-5/↙←↑→↘). Since "Darkfluid" was Link Summoned, its effect lets Playmaker place  counters  on it, equal to the number of Cyberse monsters in his GY with different monster card types ( Ritual ,  Fusion ,  Synchro , and  Xyz ). Since Playmaker has all four types of cards in his GY, "Darkfluid" gains 4 Counters ("Darkfluid" Counters: 4). 
 "Darkfluid" attacks " Perfectron Hydradrive Dragon ". As a monster it points to is battling, the effect of " Judgment Arrows " doubles its ATK (Perfectron: 4000 → 8000 ATK). During the Battle Phase, the effect of "Darkfluid" increases its ATK by 2500 for every counter on it ("Darkfluid": 3000 → 13000 ATK). The effect of "Perfectron" reduces all Battle Damage to 0 while it has a Hydradrive counter, and by removing one Hydradrive counter Bohman can prevent its destruction by battle (Hydradrive Counter: 4 → 3; "Perfectron": 8000 → 6000 ATK). The other effect of "Perfectron" activates, which would destroy all monsters Playmaker controls, but Playmaker activates the effect of "Darkfluid". As the opponent activated a monster effect, Playmaker can remove one counter to negate that effect and allow "Darkfluid" to attack again (Counter 4 → 3; "Darkfluid": 13000 → 10500 ATK).
 At this point, the Duel became a loop where "Darkfluid" attacks "Perfectron", Bohman uses the effects of "Perfectron" and Playmaker uses the effect of "Darkfluid" to attack again (Hydradrive Counter / Darkluid's Counter: 3 → 2 → 1 → 0; "Perfectron": 6000 → 4000 → 2000 → 0 ATK; "Darkfluid" 10500 → 8000 → 5500 → 3000 ATK). "Darkfluid" attacks one last time and destroys "Perfectron" (Bohman: 2500 → 0 LP).
