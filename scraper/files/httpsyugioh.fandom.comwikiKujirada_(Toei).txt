 Biography 
 Kujirada was bullied and manipulated by  Haiyama .
 Kujirada broke a shop window and took a Digital Pet, valued at 50,000 yen, as it is a Gold Pet, from it. When the angry shop owner approaches him, he drops an abundance of bank notes over him. He used the Digital Pet,  Devil Master  to eat  Anzu Mazaki 's pet,  Sumomo-chan .  Katsuya Jonouchi  linked his pet,  Joe , to Devil Master to battle it, but it wound up getting eaten too.  Hiroto Honda  connected his pet,  Super Strawberry , to Devil Master and swept it up.
 After losing, Haiyama punished Kujirada, by whipping him.
