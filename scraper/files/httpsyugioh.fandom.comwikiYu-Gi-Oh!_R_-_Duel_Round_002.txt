 Kaibacorp Duel Begins!! 
 
 "Avatar's Menace!!" , known as  "Threatening God of Avatar!!"  in the Japanese version, is the second chapter of the  Yu-Gi-Oh! R  manga. It was first printed in Japan in  V Jump  magazine on May 21, 2004. It was later reprinted in volume 1 of Yu-Gi-Oh! R.
 
 Summary 
 Yugi Mutou  and  Yako Tenma 's Duel continues on. After Yako summons " The Wicked Avatar ", and it transforms into "Slifer," Yugi uses his own god's effect, " Slifer the Sky Dragon ", to lower its attack. But Yako explains that it has no effect because the "Avatar" is on a higher scale than "Slifer". Yako then goes into talking about a rank among the  Gods . He says that it's like a pyramid with  "Ra"  on top, and "Slifer" and  Obelisk  at the base. He then declares that his Avatar is the same "rank" as Yugi's Ra.
 Yako begins saying that he is the one who created "The Wicked Avatar" on behalf of  Maximillion Pegasus  who initially designed it but was very hesitant to actually create it himself. We are then taken to a flashback of Pegasus having tea with Yako a day before the  Duelist Kingdom  Tournament was scheduled to begin. It then flashes immediately to the Duel table where Yugi dueled Pegasus for the title of King of Games and his  grandfather's  soul, with a  Duel Monsters   card  featuring Pegasus's lover,  Cyndia , splattered in blood. After Yako sees this, he demands  Croquet  to tell him who killed Pegasus, who in turn replies that it was Yugi.
 We then see  Anzu Mazaki  disappearing into thin air. In order for Yako's plan to work, he captured Anzu and was using the  KaibaCorp  solid vision system so that nobody would notice her absence. He says to Yugi,  Katsuya Jonouchi , and  Hiroto Honda  that if they ever want to see her again, they will have to infiltrate the  KaibaCorp  main headquarters and duel all of Yako's duelists in the tower. After this, the real Yako tells his staff to proceed to phase three of his plan.
 Jonouchi, Honda, and Dark Yugi are then seen at the base of the KaibaCorp building, ready to save Anzu.
 
 Featured Duel: Dark Yugi vs. Yako Tenma 
 Duel continues from the previous chapter . 
 Yako's turn 
 Yako  has just Summoned " The Wicked Avatar ". The  effect  of  " Slifer the Sky Dragon "  activates , which would lower the  ATK  of "Avatar" by 2000. "Avatar" is unaffected by this as it has a greater  Hierarchy . "Avatar" gains ATK and  DEF  equal to the ATK of the strongest monster on the field plus one (4001/4001). (Note: At this point, the effect of "Avatar" is unknown.)
 "Avatar" attacks and  destroys  "Slifer".
 The Duel ends with no result after Yako reveals that he kidnapped Anzu.
