 Quija 
 Is it worth noting how similar the game's in-story origin is to the invention of the modern Quija? They're both ancient methods of divination and invocation rediscovered after years by a western businessman who stole the ideas to use in a game for children with unintended results. -- BobLogical  ( talk  •  contribs ) 18:21, December 7, 2016 (UTC)
 
 No, because the similarities are coincidental at best (and I have no idea what "unintended results" you could be referring to for ouija).  「 ディノ 奴 千？！ 」 ?  ·  ☎ Dinoguy1000  20:39, December 9, 2016 (UTC)
