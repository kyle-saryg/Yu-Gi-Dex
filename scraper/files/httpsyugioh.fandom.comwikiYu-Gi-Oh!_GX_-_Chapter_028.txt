 Shadow Game!! 
 
 Fusion Summon!!  is the twenty-eighth chapter of the  Yu-Gi-Oh! GX manga . It was first printed in Japanese in  V Jump  magazine and in English in  Shonen Jump  magazine. Both of which were printed in  volume 4  of the Yu-Gi-Oh! GX graphic novels afterwards.
 
 Summary 
 Bastion Misawa  has essentially locked  Jaden Yuki  out of  Fusion Summoning  using " Narukami Waterfall " and " Fires of Shiranui ". Jaden knows this will also affect Bastion, as the latter card prevents him from  Tribute Summoning . " Gozuki " also poses a problem, as it sends a  Yokai  monster from Bastion's  Deck  to the Graveyard each turn, and they work best when  Special Summoned  from the Graveyard. The " Saber of Malice "- equipped  " Mezuki " can destroy any  Defense Position  monsters he Summons easily, and he knows he can't rush in and attack it, as it can Summon another Yokai monster by being  removed from play  once in the Graveyard.
 Jaden  draws  " Magician's Library ", and knows he could use it to move a  Trap -destruction  Spell Card  to his hand, but with no monsters to Summon, he'd be open to attack next turn. Then he realizes that he can still  Fusion Summon  - but from his Deck. He  activates  "Magician's Archive", adding a Spell Card from his Deck to his hand. He then plays " Soul Return ", which places " Elemental Hero Ocean " and " Elemental Hero Woodsman  in his  Graveyard  back on top of his Deck. He then plays " Fusion Birth ", which sends the top five cards of his Deck to the Graveyard, with him being permitted to Fusion Summon any applicable monsters made up of the cards sent. Despite all Bastion's planning to prevent it, Jaden still Fusion Summons " Elemental Hero Terra Firma ", shocking Bastion. "Terra Firma" attacks and destroys "Gozuki", reducing Bastion to 2800  Life Points .
 With "Terra Firma" Summoned, Bastion believes he'll have to rely on " Enma's Judgment " to Summon " Red Ogre ", but he can only activate that card should Jaden Special Summon another monster. He resolves to believe in his Deck just as Jaden does, and draws. He activates his  face-down  " Ghostly Reinforcements ",  paying  1000 Life Points to Special Summon "Gozuki" and "Onmoraki" from his Graveyard. He states he's going to Summon a  Level  8 monster, with Jaden protesting that "Fires of Shiranui" should prevent that. Bastion explains that when "Gozuki" and "Mezuki" are both on the field, he may Special Summon " Fire Wagon " from his hand. "Fire Wagon's" effect activates, returning all monsters on the field to their owner's Deck. Its attack power then becomes equal to the number of Yokai Monsters returned via that effect, meaning 3000. "Fire Wagon" attacks  directly , reducing Jaden to 800 Life Points.
 Jaden activates " Gift of the Weak ", removing " Elemental Hero Knospe " in his hand from play to draw two cards - " Soul Release " and " Terra Firma Gravity ". He contemplates using " Parallel World Fusion " to Summon "Terra Firma" again, but realizes that wouldn't be enough to destroy "Fire Wagon". Instead, he plays "Soul Release", choosing to remove five cards in his own Graveyard from play, including "Woodsman". He then plays "Parallel World Fusion", fusing the "Knospe" and "Woodsman" he removed from play to Fusion Summon " Elemental Hero Gaia " in Attack Position. Its effect activates, halving "Fire Wagon's" attack power and adding that value to its own. "Gaia" attacks, and Bastion is defeated.  Zane Truesdale  remarks on how skilled the first-year duelists are, and wonders if  Atticus Rhodes  would agree.
 
 Featured Duel: Jaden Yuki vs. Bastion Misawa 
 Duel continues from  the previous chapter .
 Turn 8: Jaden 
Jaden draws " Magician's Library " and subsequently  activates  it, adding " Fusion Birth " from his  Deck  to his  hand  and then shuffling his deck. He then activates " Soul Return ", transferring both " Elemental Hero Woodsman " and " Elemental Hero Ocean " from his  Graveyard  to the top of his Deck. He then activates "Fusion Birth",  sending  the top five cards of his Deck to the Graveyard, and, as "Woodsman" and "Ocean" were sent to the Graveyard by this way, " Elemental Hero Terra Firma " (2500/2000) is  Fusion Summoned  in  Attack Position . "Terra Firma"  attacks  and  destroys  " Gozuki " (Bastion: 3700 → 2900).
 Turn 9: Bastion 
Bastion draws "Fire Wagon". He then activates his  face-down  " Ghostly Reinforcements ",  paying  1000  Life Points  (Bastion: 2900 → 1900) to  Special Summon  the  Level  4 " Gozuki " (1700/800) and " Onmoraki " (1200/1000) from his Graveyard. He then Special Summons " Fire Wagon " (?/1000) from his hand in Attack Position as he  controls  both " Mezuki " and "Gozuki". Since it was Summoned, the  effect  of "Fire Wagon" activates, returning all other  monsters  on the  field  to their respective  owners ' Decks. "Elemental Hero Terra Firma" returns to Jaden's  Extra Deck  while "Gozuki", "Mezuki", and "Onmoraki" return to Bastions's hand. "Fire Wagon's" second effect then activates, increasing its  ATK  by the number of  Yokai Monsters  returned to the player's hand by its first effect x1000. Three Yokai monsters were returned in this way (? → 3000/1000). "Fire Wagon" attacks  directly  (Jaden: 3800 → 800).
 Turn 10: Jaden 
Jaden draws "Elemental Hero Knospe". He then activates " Gift of the Weak ",  removing  the " Elemental Hero Knospe " in his hand from play to  draw  two cards. He activates " Soul Release ", removing five cards in his Graveyard from play, including "Woodsman" and "Ocean". He then activates " Parallel World Fusion ", Fusion Summoning " Elemental Hero Gaia " (2200/2600) in Attack Position using the removed "Woodsman" and "Knospe" as  Fusion Materials . Since "Gaia" was Summoned, its effect activates, reducing the ATK of "Fire Wagon" by half ("Fire Wagon": 3000 → 1500/1000), and increasing its own by the same amount, ("Gaia": 2200 → 3700/2600). "Gaia" attacks and destroys "Fire Wagon" (Bastion: 1900 → 0).
