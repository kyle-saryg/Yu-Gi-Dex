 TCG Rulings 
 “ Against the Wind ”  targets  1 “ Blackwing ” monster in your Graveyard. [1] 
 If you control “ Des Wombat ,” you can activate “ Against the Wind ,” but since the damage you take becomes 0, you cannot add a card to your hand. [1] 
 If an effect is chained that removes the targeted monster from the Graveyard, you take no damage and do not add it to your hand. [1] 
 The effects of “ Against the Wind ” to inflict damage and add a card to your hand are considered to be simultaneous, although as a practical matter you take the damage first. This means that you can activate effects like “ Numinous Healer ” without  missing the timing . [1]

 OCG Rulings 
 This card  targets  1 " Blackwing " monster in your Graveyard. [2] 
 If " D.D. Crow " is  chained  to the effect of " Against the Wind " so that the  targeted  " Blackwing " monster is not in the Graveyard when resolving the effect of " Against the Wind ", then you do not return the " Blackwing " monster to your hand, and you do not take damage. [3] 
 If you control " Des Wombat ", you cannot activate " Against the Wind ". If you chain " Call of the Haunted " to " Against the Wind " and Special Summon " Des Wombat ", since the damage you take becomes 0, you cannot add the targeted " Blackwing " monster from your Graveyard to your hand. [4] 
 While " Black-Winged Dragon " is on the field, if you activate " Against the Wind ", then when resolving the effect you instead place one  Black Feather Counter  on " Black-Winged Dragon ". You did not receive damage from the effect of " Against the Wind " equal to the " Blackwing " monster's ATK, so you cannot add that " Blackwing " monster to your hand. [5]
