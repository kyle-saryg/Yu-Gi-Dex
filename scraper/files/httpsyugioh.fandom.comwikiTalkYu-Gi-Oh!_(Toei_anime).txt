"Season Zero" is somewhat correct in America, because it is a season that technically never aired in America (not counting YouTube, duh). Plus it should say "Season Zero" not "zero season".
 
 It shouldn't be referred to as a season at all. It was a series, albeit a very short one, made by a different company. - Malus X  ( talk  â€¢  contribs ) 03:51, January 7, 2011 (UTC) 
 Incomplete Episode Guide 
 I wonder, why doesn't anyone write the summaries for the episodes like  Episode 5 ,  Episode 6 , or the others. In fact,  Episode 3's  summary is incomplete. And I don't feel like doing it. -- NejiHyuga900  ( talk  |  contributions )  "I am the Thunder Dragon!" 03:49, August 10, 2010 (UTC)
 
 Rename 
 The page should be moved to "Yu-Gi-Oh! (first - series anime). Subsequently, the second-series one should be "Yu-Gi-Oh! (second - series anime).  31.11.101.253  ( talk ) 18:25, April 19, 2013 (UTC)
