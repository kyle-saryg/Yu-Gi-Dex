 OCG Rulings 
 If a monster is forced to attack by " Amazoness Archers ", and a  replay  occurs, then you cannot choose to  attack with  a different monster.  You can choose to  attack  a different monster. [1] 
 Previously Official Rulings 
   These TCG rulings were issued by  Upper Deck Entertainment  and have since been deemed unofficial by Konami. [2]  They were previously considered official and can still be correct, as long as they follow the official gameplay rules, or unless Konami has issued a ruling that says otherwise. References:  [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] 
 
 "These monsters" means all of your opponent's  face-up  monsters on the  field  at the time " Amazoness Archers "  resolves , not just the monsters that were  flipped  by " Amazoness Archers "' effect. 
 If you activate " Amazoness Archers " during the  Battle Phase  and your opponent  Special Summons  another monster afterwards (such as with " Call of the Haunted ", or if " Cyber Jar " is flipped), the newly-Summoned monster is not affected by " Amazoness Archers " and does not suffer the -500  ATK  reduction nor does it have to attack. 
 The -500 ATK applies to each monster as long as that monster remains face-up on the field. You can activate multiple " Amazoness Archers " and the ATK reductions are cumulative (so -1000 ATK with 2 copies). 
 " Amazoness Archers " vs. " Cat's Ear Tribe ": the ATK is 200. 
 If " Fushioh Richie " or " Otohime " are flipped face-up by " Amazoness Archers '  [ sic ]  effect, their effects are activated because their effects are not  Flip Effects ; their effects begin a new  chain  that resolves after the current chain. 
 If a  face-down  " Jinzo " is flipped by " Amazoness Archers ", " Amazoness Archers "' effect is not  negated . 
 The effect of " Amazoness Archers " will make your opponent have to attack with all of his monsters if he has multiple monsters on his side of the field. If " Amazoness Archers " is in effect, and later a replay occurs, your opponent cannot choose not to attack. 
 Monsters that have already attacked cannot attack again. If " The Dark Door " is active, your opponent still can only attack with 1 monster. Monsters which cannot attack still cannot attack ( Toon  Monsters the turn they are Summoned, " Ultimate Obedient Fiend " under the wrong conditions, etc.) If " Diffusion Wave-Motion " is in effect, only the monster affected by " Diffusion Wave-Motion " can attack. The ATK reduction of " Amazoness Archers " is still applied in these cases where monsters cannot attack. 
 If you activate " Amazoness Archers " and chain " Magic Cylinder ", " Magic Cylinder " does the full damage before the -500 ATK is applied; your opponent's other monsters must attack normally. If you chain " Amazoness Archers " to " Magic Cylinder ", the ATK is reduced first and then " Magic Cylinder " does damage. 
 If either player chains " Negate Attack " to " Amazoness Archers ", the  Battle Phase  ends because of " Negate Attack "'s effect. 
 Mentions in Other Rulings 
 Diffusion Wave-Motion : If your opponent activates "Amazoness Archers" when your selected  Level  7  Spellcaster - Type  monster attacks, only the Level 7 Spellcaster-Type monster can attack because of " Diffusion Wave-Motion "'s effect, so your other monsters do not attack, but the -500 ATK effect of "Amazoness Archers" is still applied to all of your monsters. 
 Lord of D. : " Lord of D. " will NOT stop..." Amazoness Archers ", nor will he protect your  Dragon -Type monsters from their effects, since these cards affect the whole  field  and do not select  targets . 
 Raviel, Lord of Phantasms : A " Phantasm Token " cannot be forced to attack with a card effect like..." Amazoness Archers ".
