 The  field  (フィールド  fīrudo ) is the area where  Duelists  place their cards.  Game Mats  (or playmats) are often used as field. 
 The field is divided into two halves, one for each player, with each half having 5  Main Monster Zones , 5  Spell & Trap Zones  (including 2  Pendulum Zones ), a  Field Zone , a  Deck Zone , an  Extra Deck Zone , and a  Graveyard . In the middle of the field, there are 2  Extra Monster Zones , which do not belong to either player while unoccupied.
 The "field" referenced by  card text  is the combination of each player's Monster Zones, Spell & Trap Zones, Pendulum Zones and Field Zones. Thus, the field is shared and each player controls only one side of it.
 The field is also unofficially referred to as the  board .

 The top 5 Zones in the middle are the  Monster Zones . 
 The bottom left Zone is the  Extra Deck Zone  (originally known as the Fusion Deck Zone).

 The bottom 5 Zones in the middle are the  Spell & Trap Zones  (originally known as the Magic & Trap Card Zones). 
 Conceptually, there is an additional space sometimes referred to as the  Banished  Zone. However, it is never represented on official Game Mats, since it is not actually a Zone. Most video games place  banished  cards in a pile to the right of the Graveyard.

 The far left (blue-colored) and far right (red-colored) Spell & Trap Zones are also  Pendulum Zones  while they are occupied by  Pendulum Monster(s ). 
 Conceptually, there is an additional space sometimes referred to as the  Banished  Zone. However, it is never represented on official Game Mats, since it is not actually a Zone. Most video games place  banished  cards in a pile to the right of the Graveyard. 
 Notes 
 
 ↑   Not capitalized in the English and Portuguese versions 
 
 ↑   In the English, German, Spanish and Portuguese versions, such expressions as "your side of the field" and "your opponent's side of the field" are used. In the  French  and Italian versions, the equivalents are "your Field" and "your opponent's Field", mirroring the Japanese ones which are 自分フィールド  jibun fīrudo  "one's own field" and 相手フィールド  aite fīrudo  "opponent's field".
