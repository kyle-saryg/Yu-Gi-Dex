 "Bad Developments: Part 2" , known as  "The Power to Cut Open the Future! King of Wishes, Hope Ray"  in the Japanese version, is the thirty-sixth episode of the  Yu-Gi-Oh! ZEXAL  anime. It first aired in Japan on December 19, 2011 and in the United States on November 3, 2012.
 Yuma  is having trouble in his Duel against  Cameron , and the dangerous future of  Tori  encountering an accident is continuously approaching. Then, " Number 25: Force Focus ", controlled by Cameron, finally shows up. Yuma cannot win without Summoning  "Utopia" , but according to the prophecy, Yuma will lose in this Duel for sure if he Summons it. Under this desperate circumstance, in order to grasp the future within his own hands, Yuma delivers a bold strategy!
 
 Featured Duel: Yuma Tsukumo vs. Cameron Clix 
 Duel continues from  the previous episode . 
 Turn 3: Yuma 
 Yuma   draws  " Bye Bye Damage ". He then  Normal Summons  " Achacha Archer " ( 3/1200/600) in Attack Position. As "Achacha Archer" was summoned, Yuma activates its effect to inflict 500 damage to Cameron (Cameron: 4000 → 3500 LP). Yuma  Sets  a card ("Bye Bye Damage").
 Turn 4: Cameron 
Cameron draws ("Cameraclops": 2600 → 3000 ATK). Cameron  activates  " Night Beam " to  destroy  Yuma's Set "Bye Bye Damage" ("Cameraclops": 3000 → 2600 ATK). He then Normal Summons " Scandal Snapper " ( 4/700/2000) in Attack Position ("Cameraclops": 2600 → 2200 ATK).
 "Cameraclops"  attacks  and destroys "Achacha Archer" (Yuma: 2900 → 1900 LP). "Scandal Snapper" attacks  directly  (Yuma: 1900 → 1200 LP). Since "Scandal Snapper" inflicted battle damage, Cameron activates its effect to increase its Level by two ("Scandal Snapper":   4 → 6) and switch it to Defense Position. Cameron activates " Xyz Frame ", which will prevent non- Xyz Monsters  from attacking during the next  turn  ("Cameraclops": 2200 → 1800 ATK).
 Turn 5: Yuma 
Yuma draws " Gogogo Giant " and subsequently Normal Summons it ( 4/2000/0) in Attack Position. As "Gogogo Giant" was Normal Summoned, Yuma activates its effect to revive " Gogogo Golem " ( 4/1800/1500) in  Defense Position  and switch "Gogogo Giant" to Defense Position. Cameron intends for Yuma to overlay his two monsters in order to Xyz Summon " Number 39: Utopia ", but Yuma ends his turn.
 Turn 6: Cameron 
 
                 No. 25 Fullmetal Photoglide - Focus Force   The Summoning of " Number 25: Force Focus "     
 Cameron draws. He then Normal Summons " Paparazzi Pest " ( 2/1000/0) in Attack Position. Cameron then activates this card's effect to  Tribute  itself and increase the Level of "Cameraclops" by 2 ("Cameraclops":   4 → 6). Cameron  overlays  "Cameraclops" and "Scandal Snapper" in order to  Xyz Summon  " Number 25: Force Focus " ( 6/2800/2400, ORU: 2) in Attack Position. 
 "Force Focus" attacks "Gogogo Golem". Yuma explains that the effect of "Gogogo Golem" would prevent its  destruction in battle  once per turn if it is in Defense Position, but Cameron activates the effect of "Force Focus" to  detaching  "Cameraclops" ("Force Focus": 2 → 1 ORU) and  negate  the effect of "Gogogo Golem" until the end of this turn. "Force Focus" then destroys "Gogogo Golem". 
 Turn 7: Yuma 
Yuma draws " Overlay Owl " and subsequently Normal Summons it ( 4/800/1600) in Attack Position. Yuma then activates the effect of "Overlay Owl" to  pay  600  LP  (Yuma: 1200 → 600 LP) and detach "Cameraclops" from "Force Focus" ("Force Focus": 1 → 0 ORU). Yuma overlays "Gogogo Giant" and Overlay Owl" in order to Xyz Summon " Number 39: Utopia " ( 4/2500/2000, ORU: 2) in Attack Position. 
 Yuma performs  Chaos Xyz Evolution  and overlays "Utopia" and its Overlay Units in order to Xyz Summon " Chaos Number 39: Utopia Ray " ( 4/2500/2000, ORU: 3) in Attack Position. Yuma then activates the effect of "Utopia Ray" three times to detach all of its Overlay Units ("Utopia Ray": 3 → 0 ORU) and increase its ATK by 500 for each Overlay Unit as well as subsequently decrease the ATK of "Force Focus" by 1000 for each Overlay Unit detached ("Utopia Ray": 2500 → 4000 ATK, "Force Focus": 2800 → 0 ATK). "Utopia Ray" attacks and destroys "Force Focus" (Cameron: 3500 → 0 LP).
