 French and Chinese 
 I see there are French and Chinese covers for the manga. Did they (both French and Chinese) have promotional cards for all the volumes too? With this I mean, should galleries and lists be added to the Promotional Card articles?  Becasita   Pendulum  ( talk  •  contribs ) 00:39, February 27, 2016 (UTC)
 
 Remember that you can always check the TCG card database to see if a card was printed in a TCG language for a certain product (with the exception of Portuguese). And seeing as  Duel Starter Deck  was the first official Chinese OCG product... I'd say there are no Chinese promo cards. -- UltimateKuriboh  ( talk  •  contribs ) 01:52, February 27, 2016 (UTC) 
 The database generally is a good resource, but there are releases it doesn't document; it doesn't hurt to also look for card images to double-check its information (or lack thereof).  「 ディノ 奴 千？！ 」 ?  ·  ☎ Dinoguy1000  09:53, February 27, 2016 (UTC) 
 I've tried the database, but it doesn't always work. One good example is  Dark Highlander . As you can see by  its gallery , there was a French Promo release, but the database doesn't list it. Looking for pictures may not work, as one may not be able to find them even though they exist (in cases they are rare), but I'll try that. 
 As for the Chinese, yeah, you're right.  Becasita   Pendulum  ( talk  •  contribs ) 13:46, February 27, 2016 (UTC) 
 Nope, I wasn't able to find any pics from the French cards, except for  the one we already had .  Becasita   Pendulum  ( talk  •  contribs ) 21:19, March 1, 2016 (UTC) 
 According to a French friend of mine, there was only 1 French promo card for  each  of the manga series: GX, 5D's, and ZEXAL. So, 3 promo cards overall. -- UltimateKuriboh  ( talk  •  contribs ) 16:15, March 7, 2016 (UTC) 
 Ah! That explains it. We have all of them, then. Thanks. And my thanks to your friend as well.  Becasita   Pendulum  ( talk  •  contribs ) 20:24, March 7, 2016 (UTC)
