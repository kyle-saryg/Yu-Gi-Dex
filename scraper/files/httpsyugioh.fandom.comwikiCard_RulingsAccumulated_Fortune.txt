 After " Mystical Wind Typhoon " is activated as Chain Link 3, two cards of the same name are not in the same  Chain  yet, so you can activate a second copy of " Mystical Wind Typhoon " as Chain Link 4.  However, you cannot activate a third " Mystical Wind Typhoon " as Chain Link 5 because two copies of " Mystical Wind Typhoon " were  activated  in the same  Chain . [1]
