 Vector  continues to cause trouble, but then the power of  Don Thousand , which should have been erased, revives once more, as he now becomes completely free of Vector's body... All of this has been Don Thousand's plan. With his body no longer tied to Vector, he now plans to try and absorb even Yuma. At that time,  Mizar , who fought a fierce battle with  Kite , appears, and challenges Don Thousand to a Duel.

 Summary 
       Those  Vector  has killed come for revenge.     
 Nash  tells  Vector  to crumble into dust and blow away in the wind as " Chaos Number 73: Abyss Supra Splash " fires a beam from its staff into the core of " Chaos Number 5: Chaos Chimera Dragon ". A massive explosion ensues and Vector's  Life Points  fall to 0 and he's thrown backwards, resuming his human form in the process (these events are cut from the dub, as they took place in the previous episode).  Yuma  cheers that  Shark  won. As Vector hits the ground, he can scarcely believe he lost. Nash taunts him, saying it's just like the last time. Vector angrily asks what he means and Nash explains that the last time he confronted him here, the wandering souls of those Vector have murdered gathered here after Vector lost, carrying their resentment and sorrow. As Nash stood there victorious in his past life, those souls swarmed over Vector and carried him to the darkest depths of the abyss as he screamed in terror. Vector tells Nash not to speak to him that way (in the dub, Vector denies hearing the voices), but those same souls reappear now and grab Vector again, swarming over him and preparing to drag him back to the darkness once again.  Tori  asks what is going on (Tori's quote is cut from the dub), while Vector yells "stop it" in sheer terror. Nash remarks that no matter the place or time, the wicked who revel in their own power will end up destroying themselves (in the dub, Nash tells Vector it's over; the spirits will drag Vector back to the shadows). Vector insists that it won't be the same this time as purple fire shoots from him and the souls around him melt away. He yells that he is stronger than the  Seven Barian Emperors  or even  Don Thousand  - and if he goes down, he will drag Nash down with him. 
 
       Don Thousand  reappears.     
 As Vector glows with power and cackles, the  ruins  lift off of the  Barian City  they've embedded themselves in, the floor cracking around Nash, who cannot believe how much power Vector still has left. Vector continues laughing and claims he is practically a god. Don Thousand's voice rings out, telling Vector not to misunderstand (in the dub, Thousand calls Vector's statement interesting). As Vector turns, Thousand bursts from the ground of the Barian World, towering up to a huge form, the upper part of his body above even the levitating ruins. He insists that this power is not Vector's. Vector is shocked that Thousand is back after being burned to ashes. Thousand taunts him, asking if he was so much a fool that he thought he could destroy him. Thousand remarks he was simply waiting for this opportunity and now the time has come (in the dub, Thousand says he was aware of Vector's actions, while also admitting that Vector was right - one with limitless power cannot be beaten. Thousand also calls Vector a "meaningless flea" and chides him for believing that his power was his to have forever while adding that what he has given can be taken away. Thousand also calls Vector an "ignorant puppet" and continues that Vector boasted that he no longer needed Thousand) - Vector has outlived his usefulness.
 
       Yuma  resolves to save Vector.     
 The eye on Don Thousand's torso glows red and then opens and from it emerges a fierce wind. Nash struggles to remain standing, while Yuma and Tori are both taken to their knees. Vector scrambles around, but is drawn closer to the edge. He squeals in terror, insisting that he cannot die like this (in the dub, Vector begs for Thousand's forgiveness). Nash falls to his knees as Vector barely holds onto a crack in the ground. Yuma leaps to his feet, running towards Vector and yelling his name. Tori yells Yuma's name, while  Astral  asks what he's doing. Vector screams in terror as he's torn from the ruins and taken closer to Thousand's maw. Yuma yells " kattobingu " and barely manages to catch Vector's hand. Yuma asks if he's alright and instructs him not to let go. Vector simply mutters Yuma's name, while Thousand laughs and asks if Yuma is really trying to help his mortal enemy (in the dub, Thousand remarks that it's amusing that the "helpless is helping the hapless"). Tori urges him to let go, while Astral adds that he'll just end up being sucked in as well. Yuma claims he could not live with himself if he didn't try to help (in the dub, Tori asks what Yuma is doing, while Astral yells that Yuma is in danger. Yuma replies that he knows, but he can't give up now). Even Nash urges Yuma to stop, saying that Vector has no soul - even if he saves him, Vector will just stab him in the back again. Yuma responds that even if that happens, he'll believe in Vector one more time. He remarks that even if Vector has no heart or soul, that does not stop him from believing that he is capable of having them (in the dub, Yuma admits that Nash may be right, but this is a chance he is willing to take; no matter what Vector has done, he deserves a second chance). He yells "kattobingu" again, while Nash mutters Yuma's name (in the dub, Nash says this will be Vector's thirtieth chance). Yuma insists that even Vector has a good heart - and he showed it when he pretended to be Ray Shadows. He remarks that Ray was a nosy jerk who caused Yuma a lot of grief (in the dub, Yuma says that they had awesome times together), but everyone loved him just the same - he was their friend. 
 
         Vector is absorbed by Don Thousand.     
 Yuma believes Vector showed his true self when he was Ray. Vector mutters that Yuma may be right. Yuma insists he is and urges Vector to start over as Ray once more. Vector calls him "Yuma-kun" and then adopts a crazed expression, yelling that they should go down with this ship together (in the dub, Vector calls Yuma "the most trusting simpleton who has ever lived") - Yuma will die by his side. Astral yells Yuma's name, while Tori yells "no!" Vector cackles and tells Yuma to join him. Yuma agrees to do so, teardrops forming in his eyes. He insists that Ray is not alone and that he will protect him. A teardrop hits Vector's face and he mutters "Yuma..." while also thinking of his time as Ray. Yuma claims from now on, Vector will be their friend. Yuma adds that he will leave no one behind - he will protect Vector. Vector tells Yuma that this world needs more of Yuma and less of Vector. He decided he cannot drag Yuma down with him though. Vector gives his farewell and lets go of Yuma's hand. As he is driven into Thousand's maw, he ends with "Yuma-kun". Yuma screams Ray's name (in the dub, he says "Why did you let go?") and pounds both fists into the ground as the winds dissipate. 
 
         Don Thousand's body cracks.     
 Thousand laughs, while cracks begin to form along his body, from which light escapes. He boasts that Vector's power is his now. Yuma claims he'll never forgive Don Thousand for this (in the dub, Thousand says his power returned; Yuma tells him to enjoy it now, because he won't have it for long). Thousand calls him foolish as red energy gathers around his eyes. Yuma is thrown backwards. Thousand yells that his power has returned as more light bursts from his body. Tori asks what's going on (in the dub, Tori yells that they should get out of here). Thousand instructs them to behold the dawn of a new world as his entire body glows with light. A DNA-like network of Barian energy surges through the ground as  Baria Crystal  flowers rise up around them. Yuma asks what's going on. As the light dissipates, Thousand is encased in a massive stone flower above them. His voice booms out, telling them that he has merged everything into one world -  Earth  and the  Barian World  are now truly one. He instructs Yuma to look behind him. When he does, he sees  Heartland City , Barian energy flowing around it. Yuma gasps and Thousand confirms that that is the part of Earth where Yuma lived (in the dub, Thousand explains that he shattered the dimensional barriers between the two worlds). He cackles that the worlds are one now. A flash of yellow light fills the sky and a beam shoots down to the ground in front of where, Yuma, Astral, Tori and Nash have gathered. 
 
         Mizar  gives " Number 100: Numeron Dragon " to Yuma.     
 From the light emerges  Mizar , in his human form. He greets Yuma, who asks if  Kite  is really gone. Mizar confirms it - he used the last of his strength to defeat Mizar at the birthplace of the " Galaxy-Eyes " (in the dub, Yuma asks why Mizar is here, while the Barian Emperor says he came to Yuma to fulfill Kite's last wish). Mizar takes out " Number 100: Numeron Dragon " and tells Yuma that Kite entrusted him with this card. He hands the card to Yuma, saying he is entrusting Kite's final memento to him. Yuma mutters Kite's name and asks Mizar why he is giving him the card. Mizar says that Kite believed in the future - and that future is Yuma (in the dub, Mizar says Yuma will need the card, but he won't get the chance to use it). Yuma mutters Mizar's name, while Mizar turns to Nash. He tells him that the Seven Emperors had their memories altered as human beings and were dragged into the Barian World as a means to revive Don Thousand. He adds that the future they dreamed of is not the one that Don Thousand weaves. Mizar turns and teleports closer to Thousand's flower. Nash mutters Mizar's name, but Mizar tells him not to interfere - they must all simply watch this  Duel  (in the dub, Mizar tells Nash that he is righting their wrongs and facing Thousand in a Duel). Thousand asks if Mizar really dared to challenge him, having already lost his powers as a  Barian . The stone flower unfurls and Thousand's voice changes (Thousand's voice is unchanged in the dub) as he claims he is more than a god now. Thousand stands now as a glowing golden man with Barian runes on his body and flowing black hair, taller than any human, but not as tall as he was before. Tori and Yuma say that this must be Thousand's true form. Mizar asks that they fight fairly as men do (in the dub, Mizar declares that he isn't afraid of Thousand) and his  D-Pad  appears on his arm. Thousand agrees and his own D-Pad appears, one with an eye motif. Thousand claims that Mizar shall become his bread just as the others did. The two yell "Duel!", but Thousand does not move from his position atop the flower. 
 
         Mizar with " Parsec, the Interstellar Dragon ", " Galaxy Stealth Dragon " and " Schwarzschild Limit Dragon ".     
 Yuma mutters Mizar's name (Yuma's quote is cut from the dub) as Thousand  draws  his card with a flourish, jumping up as he does so (in the dub, Thousand tells Mizar that Dueling him was a mistake). After landing, he ends his  turn . Mizar is incredulous that he would end his turn without doing anything. Thousand calmly taunts him, saying that it's Mizar's turn now - perhaps he should get on with it (in the dub, Thousand asks Mizar if his move shook his resolve). Mizar declares he will show Thousand a Duel he has put his entire body and soul into. He draws and then  Normal Summons  " Heliosphere Dragon ". He then  activates  " Galaxy Wrath ", explaining that by skipping his  Battle Phase , he may  Special Summon  a  Level  4 or lower  Dragon - Type  monster from his  hand . He Special Summons " Radius, the Half-Moon Dragon " in  Attack Position . Mizar  overlays  his two Level 4 monsters to  Xyz Summon  " Galaxy Stealth Dragon " (curiously, the  Overlay Network  used is the one usually reserved for " Numbers ") in Attack Position. 
 Mizar activates the  effect  of "Stealth Dragon", his hand glowing with yellow energy. He can  detach  an Overlay Unit to Special Summon a Dragon-Type monster from his hand. He uses the effect twice, Special Summoning " Schwarzschild Limit Dragon " and " Parsec, the Interstellar Dragon ", both in Attack Position. Tori calls it amazing that he dropped three monsters so easily, but Yuma points out that he skipped his Battle Phase. Astral simply says "no", while Nash finishes by saying that he has a different aim. Mizar instructs Thousand to behold the final trump card of a dragon tamer - " Dragon King's Demise ". This card will  Tribute  all Dragon-Type monsters he controls and inflict their combined  ATK  to both players as  damage . 
 
         The wrong card appears on Mizar's field.      His monsters vanish and their energy forms into a dragon-shaped beam of light. Yuma realizes what he's planning, while Astral asks if he intends to take Don Thousand down with him. Nash yells for Mizar not to do it. Mizar claims the bonds of friendship he has with his dragons will drag Thousand back to the deepest pits of Hell in exchange for his own life. He tells Thousand to taste 4800 damage as the light dragon splits into two and each of them flies towards the Duelists. As they are about to hit, both vanish. Mizar is confused, prompting Thousand to suggest he look at the card on his field. Mizar looks and says that it can't be - " Card of the Dragon King " has been activated. He asks what's going on - he activated "Dragon King's Demise". Thousand taunts that it doesn't matter, as the card on his field is clearly "Card of the Dragon King". Thousand explains that all Dragon-Type monsters Mizar controls are Tributed, with Mizar finishing that he'd then draw that many cards...but he'll take the combined ATK of the Tributed monsters as damage. (The card drawing effect is not mentioned in the dub.) Yuma is confused, while Thousand says he's afraid that this means Mizar loses - he'll take 4800 damage now (in the dub, Thousand adds that it was foolish of Mizar to challenge him). One light dragon appears this time and it hits Mizar, blasting him off his feet and reducing his Life Points to 0. 
 Yuma and Nash both run towards Mizar's prone form, Yuma yelling his name. Yuma calls Mizar an idiot and asks why he did something so stupid. Mizar responds that it's because he found something to believe in. He believed in Kite and in the rest of them - he had finally learned to believe in others (in the dub, Mizar admits that his pride got in the way during the Duel; he was so caught up in defeating Thousand that he became careless). As Astral and Tori catch up, Mizar begs Nash, Yuma and Astral to finish this. He vanishes in a yellow light and Nash tearfully says his name. A yellow energy ball floats where Mizar was and flies towards Thousand. As he glows with energy, he remarks that Nash is the only one of the Seven Emperors remaining.  Don Thousand's emblem  radiates outward, the six bars around the central image now filled with the colors of the other six Emperors. Thousand levitates off of his feet and suggests that it's time Nash returned to him as well. He reveals that billions of Barian souls already reside within Thousand - some are the friends Nash lost in the war (in the dub, Thousand only mentions  Marin ). 
 
         Astral  gives Yuma and  Nash  his counsel.     
 He addresses Yuma and Astral too as he floats down from the flower and lands in front of them. He claims he will feast on their souls as well - and obtain their power to become a true god. Thousand's body ceases its glowing and now it appears black instead of gold, while has hair has also reversed, now being gold. He says that none of them will escape from here - they are worms who will become his feast. He asks that they let the sacrificial Duel begin. Yuma says they'll fight him together, with Nash agreeing (in the dub, Yuma volunteers to Duel by himself, while Nash insists he should be the one to do it). Astral turns to them both and muses that Mizar risked his life to give them a message. They are past believing in others - who is friend and who is foe no longer matters (in the dub, Astral warns Yuma and Nash not to make the same mistake Mizar did) - they must face their most powerful enemy together. Addressing Nash as Shark, he asks that they all fight together. Yuma repeats this wish, while Nash says he will avenge his friends and comrades (in the dub, Nash says that they'll take him down together). Tori cheers for them all, while Astral says it is time to settle things with Don Thousand once and for all. Yuma and Nash set their D-Pads and Yuma dons his  D-Gazer . They all yell "Duel!". 
 
         The Summon of " Number 39: Utopia " is rewritten.     
 Thousand declares that he has been waiting a long time for this moment. He will bring Astral to his knees and smash him to pieces. Thousand draws and immediately ends his turn again. Tori is surprised he's done the same thing, while Yuma grunts. Astral tells them to watch their backs - Don Thousand is the strongest enemy they'll ever face (in the dub, he tells them to remember how Mizar lost). He finishes by saying that there is some trick to this Duel. Yuma agrees and draws. As he controls no monsters, he Special Summons " Toy Knight " in Attack Position via its own effect. He then Normal Summons " Gagaga Magician " and overlays his two Level 4 monsters to Xyz Summon " Number 39: Utopia ". Yuma tells Thousand to take a good look at this card - it is their hope (cut from the dub). Thousand asks if they truly believe in something like hope (in the dub, Thousand remarks that Yuma is confident and asks if this confidence will hold when a new reality is written). The eye on Thousand's D-Pad glows and the network of Barian energy below them crackles with electricity. "Utopia" grunts in pain and then suddenly explodes. Yuma yells for his monster and when the smoke clears, " Ganbara Knight " stands in its place. Even "Ganbara Knight" looks confused as to the situation, looking in both directions quizzically. Tori is confused too, while Nash and Astral both demand to know what's going on. Thousand explains that he activated a  Counter Trap Card  from his Deck called " Numeron Xyz Revision ". Nash asks how he did that, with Yuma adding that he even did it during Yuma's turn (in the dub, Yuma asks if this is how Thousand changed Mizar's cards). Thousand explains that when he controls no other cards in his  Spell & Trap Card Zone , this card can  negate  an Xyz Summon and let Thousand choose a monster from his opponent's Deck to Summon in its place, with its effects negated. Thousand adds that the effect rewrote the very fact that "Utopia" was Summoned (in the dub, Thousand says his opponents have no free actions, as he controls the past, present and future, while adding that he rewrote the past). Astral mutters "rewrote...numeron" ("rewrote the past?" in the dub), before realizing what's happened. He says this is the power of the  Numeron Code . Yuma asks how and Thousand confirms it. He explains that the whole world has become a  Field Spell Card  he activated - " Numeron Network ". This will allow him to activate a card with the power of the Numeron Code from his Deck once per turn if he controls no other cards. Astral remarks that he must have done the same thing against Mizar.
 
         Don Thousand looms over his opponents, the portal to the  Astral World  behind him.     
 Thousand says he is correct once more - using the power of "Numeron Network", he activated a Counter Trap Card called " Numeron Spell Revision ". He reveals it allowed him to negate the activation of a Spell Card, search his opponent's Deck for a Spell Card whose activation requirements could be met and activate it instead. Nash says he rewrote Mizar's card too, then, while Tori remarks that this means he can rewrite anything Yuma or Nash do. Yuma asks if Don Thousand himself has the power of the Numeron Code. Astral says that's impossible - no one has all the "Numbers" yet. Then he realizes that the Code was hidden somewhere on Earth and remarks "it can't be..." (in the dub, Astral deduces that Thousand must have found it when he merged their worlds). Thousand taunts that it took him long enough to figure it out. He reveals that he has no idea where on Earth the Code's resting place is - so he made the Earth part of the Barian World, thus gaining the Code's power in the process, as he is the god of the Barian World. Astral yells Thousand's name, while Thousand claims with this power he is a true "god" and raises his arm. A portal appears before him and he reveals he can now directly attack the  Astral World . He adds that whenever Yuma and Nash take damage, so will the Astral World. He claims he'll destroy both the fools before him and the Astral World in one stroke. He taunts for them to taste the power of his " Numeron " Deck as it destroys them.
 
 Featured Duels 
 Mizar vs. Don Thousand 
         Don Thousand  vs.  Mizar .     
 Turn 1: Don Thousand 
 Don Thousand  draws. He then passes.
 
         Mizar prepares to  overlay  " Heliosphere Dragon " and " Radius, the Half-Moon Dragon ".     
 Turn 2: Mizar 
Mizar draws. As Don Thousand  controls  no cards, he  activates  " Numeron Network " from his  hand  during Mizar's  Draw Phase . [1]  Mizar  Normal Summons  " Heliosphere Dragon " ( 4/0/1900) in Attack Position. He then activates " Galaxy Wrath ", letting him  Special Summon  " Radius, the Half-Moon Dragon " ( 4/1400/1200) in  Attack Position  (as it's a  Level  4 or lower  Dragon - Type   monster ) at the cost of skipping his  Battle Phase . Mizar  overlays  "Heliosphere Dragon" and "Radius, the Half-Moon Dragon" in order to  Xyz Summon  " Galaxy Stealth Dragon " ( 4/2000/1600, ORU: 2) in Attack Position. Mizar activates the  effect  of "Galaxy Stealth Dragon" twice to detach both its Overlay Units and Special Summon " Parsec, the Interstellar Dragon " ( 8/800/800) and " Schwarzschild Limit Dragon " ( 8/2000/0) both in Attack Position (as they are both Dragon-type monsters). 
 Mizar activates " Dragon King's Demise " to  Tribute  all monsters he controls and inflict  damage  to both players equal to the combined  ATK  of all Tributed Dragon-Type monsters. This would inflict 4800 damage to both players and force the Duel to end in a  DRAW .
 Don Thousand activates the second effect of "Numeron Network" (as he controls no other cards) to  send  " Numeron Spell Revision " (a " Numeron " card) from his  Deck  to the  Graveyard  and activate its  effect , which negates the activation of "Dragon King's Demise" and activates a different Spell Card from Mizar's Deck instead. Don Thousand chooses " Card of the Dragon King ", whose effect Tributes all Dragon-type monsters Mizar controls, inflicts damage to Mizar equal to the ATK of the Tributed monsters, and allows Mizar to  draw a card  for each monster Tributed (Mizar: 4000 → 0 LP). [1]

 Turn 2: Yuma 
Yuma draws. As Don Thousand  controls  no cards, he  activates  " Numeron Network " from his  hand  during Yuma's  Draw Phase . As he controls no  monsters , Yuma  Special Summons  " Toy Knight " ( 4/200/1200) in  Attack Position  via its own  effect . Yuma then  Normal Summons  " Gagaga Magician " ( 4/1500/1000) in Attack Position. Yuma then  overlays  "Gagaga Magician" and "Toy Knight" in order to  Xyz Summon  " Number 39: Utopia " ( 4/2500/2000, ORU: 2) in Attack Position. 
 As he controls no other cards, Thousand activates the second effect of "Numeron Network" to  send  " Numeron Xyz Revision " (a " Numeron " card) from his  Deck  to the  Graveyard  and activate its effect,  negating  the Special Summon of "Utopia",  destroying  it and allowing Don Thousand to Special Summon a monster from Yuma's Deck to his side of the  field  with its effects negated. Don Thousand Special Summons " Ganbara Knight " ( 4/0/1800) in Attack Position.
 Duel continues in  the next episode . 
 
 Trivia 
 Mizar's rewritten Spell Card contains a pun: the Japanese names of " Dragon King's Demise " and " Card of the Dragon King " (「 竜 皇 の 崩 御 」  Ryū'ō no Hō gyo  and 「 竜 皇 の 宝 札 」  Ryū'ō no Hō satsu ) differ only by the last sound.
