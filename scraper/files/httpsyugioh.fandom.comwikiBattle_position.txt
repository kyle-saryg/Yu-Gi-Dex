 A  battle position  (Japanese: 表示形式  Hyōji Keishiki , "display mode") is a  position  in which a  monster  is placed to determine how it behaves in  battle . The two battle positions are  Attack Position  and  Defense Position . Attack Position monsters are placed vertically on the field, while Defense Position monsters are placed horizontally.
 A monster on the field may  change its battle position  once per turn, during its  controller 's  Main Phase , unless it was  Summoned  that turn or declared an  attack  that turn.  Flip Summoning  a monster is considered both a Summon and a battle position change.
 
 Relation to damage calculation 
 Attack Position monsters are able to declare  attacks .
 If an Attack Position monster is attacked, the monster with lower  ATK  is  destroyed by battle  and its controller takes  battle damage  equal to the difference in ATK. If their ATK is equal, both monsters are destroyed.
 If a Defense Position monster is attacked and the attack target's  DEF  is less than the attacking monster's ATK, the attack target is destroyed by battle, but neither player takes battle damage (unless the attacking monster inflicts  piercing  battle damage).
 If a Defense Position monster is attacked and the attack target's DEF is greater than or equal to the attacking monster's ATK, then the attacking monster's controller takes battle damage equal to the difference between the attacking monster's ATK and the attack target's DEF, but neither monster is  destroyed .
