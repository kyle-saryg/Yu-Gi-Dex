 " The Beat of Defeat ", known in Japan as " Sorry, Gett-A Chance " is the eighteenth episode of the  Yu-Gi-Oh! SEVENS  anime. It aired in Japan on October 3, 2020.
 The second member of  Nail 's team is  Getta Taira , a member of  RoaRomin ! Getta was angry with  Roa , so he left the band. Roa, who promised to Duel Getta, then shows up and begins his fateful Duel with Getta, where their shouts and drum beats will clash...! Just what will happen to their friendship?
 
 Featured Duel: Roa Kirishima vs. Getta Taira 
 The Duel is conducted as a  Rush Duel .
 Turn 1: Getta Getta Normal Summons " Thunderbeatle Hi-hat " (600/600), " Thunderbeatle Bassdru " (800/800) and " Thunderbeatle Snare " (500/500). Since he controls a face-up Level 4 or lower  Thunder  monster, he activates " Thunderbeatle Gift ", inflicting 500 damage to Roa for each face-up Thunder monster he controls (Roa: 4000 → 2500 LP). Getta sets a card.
 Turn 2: Roa Roa Normal Summons " Royal Demon's Shout " (1200/0) and two copies of " Royal Demon's Groupie " (0/0), then tributes a "Royal Demon's Groupie" to Tribute Summon " Royal Demon's Funky " (0/0). Roa activates the effect of "Royal Demon's Funky", sending the top card of his Deck to the GY to target 2 monsters Getta controls. Until the End Phase, the original ATK of 1 of those monsters becomes the combined original ATK of the selected monsters, while the other monster's ATK becomes 0. He targets "Bass Drum" and "Snare" ("Snare": 500 → 1300 ATK, "Bass Drum": 800 → 0 ATK). 
 Roa tributes "Royal Demon's Funky" and "Royal Demon's Groupie" to Tribute Summon " Royal Demon's Heavymetal " (2500/0). Since it was Tribute Summoned by tributing 1 Level 5 or higher monster(s), Roa activates the effect of "Royal Demon's Heavymetal", letting him target the Level 8 or lower monster Getta controls with the lowest level, destroy it and increase the ATK of "Royal Demon's Heavymetal" by the ATK of the destroyed monster until the End Phase. He destroys "Snare" ("Royal Demon's Heavymetal": 2500 → 3800 ATK).
 "Royal Demon's Heavymetal" attacks and destroys "Bass Drum" (Getta: 4000 → 200 LP). "Royal Demon's Shout" attacks "Hi-hat". Since a monster with higher ATK than Getta's LP declared an attack while he controls a Thunder monster, Getta activates his set Trap " Thunderbeatle Gain ", letting him target 1 monster Roa controls and gain LP equal to that monster's ATK. He targets "Royal Demon's Heavymetal" (Getta: 200 → 4000 LP). The attack continues and "Hi-hat" is destroyed (Getta: 4000 → 3400 LP). 
 Turn 3: Getta Since Getta has no cards in his hand, he draws five cards. Getta Normal Summons "Hi-hat" (600/600), "Bass Drum" (800/800) and "Snare" (500/500). Since he controls 3 face-up Level 4 or lower Thunder monsters, Getta activates " Storm-Summoning Thunderbeatles ", letting him destroy all monsters Roa controls, but he cannot Normal or Special Summon monsters for the rest of the turn. "Hi-hat", "Snare" and "Bass Drum" attack Roa  directly  (Roa: 2500 → 1900 → 1400 → 600 LP). Getta sets a card.
 Turn 4: Roa Since Roa has no cards in his hand, he draws five cards. Roa Normal Summons "Royal Demon's Shout" (1200/0) and "Royal Demon's Groupie" (0/0), then tributes "Groupie" to Tribute Summon " Royal Demon's Blues " (1100/0). Roa activates the effect of "Royal Demon's Blues", sending " King's Management " from his hand to the GY to Special Summon 1 Level 7 or higher  Fiend  monster from his GY in Defense Position. He Special Summons "Royal Demon's Heavymetal (2500/0), then tributes "Royal Demon's Blues" and "Royal Demon's Heavymetal" to Tribute Summon " Royal Demon's Invasion " (2300/0). 
 Since it was Tribute Summoned by tributing 2 Level 5 or higher monsters, the effect of "Royal Demon's Invasion" destroys all face-up Level 4 or lower monsters Getta controls. "Royal Demon's Shout" and "Royal Demon's Invasion" attack Getta directly (Getta: 3400 → 2200 → 0 LP).
