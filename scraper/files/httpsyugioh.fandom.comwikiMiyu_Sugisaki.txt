 Appearance 
       Young Miyu     
 When she was a child, Miyu's hair reaches up to her nape with a side bang on each side of her hair. Her attire consists of a pink shirt with a red ribbon similar to a sailor outfit and a blue skirt.
 During the time she was captured, Miyu sports twin tails similar to Skye. As a teenager, her hair has also gotten longer.
 
 Etymology 
 Miyu's given name contains the Kanji for beauty (美) and excellence/talent (優). Together, the names can be transliterated as "Beautiful Talent".
 The letters in Miyu's name, except the "y," can spell umi, which is Japanese for "sea" or "ocean." This could refer to her connection to the WATER Ignis. 
 
 Personality 
 As a child, Miyu was very cheerful and outgoing, often accompanying and later, befriending Skye despite the latter being ostracized by her other peers. Miyu was also adventurous, showing to Skye the wedding ring of her mother. When Skye took the fall for Miyu's incident of dropping the ring and losing it, Miyu felt guilty for it and was very thankful of Skye's help despite being pulled away from her friend. This guilt would haunt her as Miyu promised herself to apologize to Skye properly one day. Miyu is also perceptive just like Aqua, as she was able to tell that Skye fought for and saved her upon being reunited with her.
 
 Biography 
 History 
       Miyu and Skye playing when they were children.     
       Miyu was taken away from Skye by her mother.     
 When they were both children, Miyu approached Skye, who was in school during the period when she and her brother had been traveling among cities. Miyu quickly befriended Skye, who was surprised, since nobody was this friendly to her. Miyu continued playing with Skye in the park, and the two became close friends, and Skye felt that Miyu even saved her from being sad. One particular day, Miyu took her mother's wedding ring without consent and showed it off proudly to Skye. Miyu wanted Skye to wear it, but Skye refused. Despite this, Miyu went to give it to her, but she accidentally lost the ring in the drain. Shocked and scared of what happened, Miyu cried as her mother came and asked her on the whereabouts of the ring. As Miyu continued crying, Skye, unwilling to see her friend getting punished, took the fall and told Miyu's mother that she was the one who lost the ring. Miyu wanted to explain that's not the truth, but her mother believed Skye and promptly told her not to approach her daughter again. Miyu felt guilty over the event and would forever remember this as a case where Skye saved her. However, she did not come to the park where Skye awaited her, and sometime after, Skye moved away with her brother. [2] 
 
         Miyu's time during the Lost Incident     
 Miyu was a victim of the Hanoi Project, where she was forced to duel to create Ignis. [3] [2]   Aqua  was created based on her duels. [2]  During the time she was captured, Miyu's reminiscence of Skye kept her strong willed and determined to escape from the Project, even during times where she lost her duels and would be electrocuted and starved. She resolved herself to meet up with Skye one day to apologize for what happened in the past. [4] 
 
 Season two 
         Aqua trying to cure Miyu     
 By the time Aqua arrived to contact her originator, Miyu had already been attacked by  Lightning , who had infected her with a computer virus that placed her in a coma.
