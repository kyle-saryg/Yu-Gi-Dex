 My work on the anime is over, so now I'm concentrating on the manga. Not like I wasn't concentrating on it before, though! (lol) I'll work hard to make sure the manga moves people in its own unique way! [2]

 When volume 6 comes out, the "ZEXAL" manga will have been running for three full years. I never dreamed I'd be part of such a big project. I'll do my best to stay humble and keep working hard! [2]
