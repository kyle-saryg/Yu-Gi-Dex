 This card is the first "Trap Hole" Trap Card that doesn't destroy/banish any monster. The second is " Floodgate Trap Hole ".
 The stickiness/adhesion part of the artwork thematically represents the monster being slowed down and weakened by this card (hence halving its ATK). 
 The Goblin that appears in the artwork of this card is the same that appears on " Bottomless Trap Hole ", " D.D. Trap Hole ", " Giant Trap Hole " and " Treacherous Trap Hole ".
