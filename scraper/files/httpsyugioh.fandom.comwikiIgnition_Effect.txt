 Ignition Monster Effects  (Japanese:  起 動 効 果   Kidō Kōka , "Startup effect") are  Spell Speed 1  effects that require a manual  activation  by the card's  controller  during their own  Main Phase 1  or  2 . This type of  effect  used to be called a  Cost Effect  in the early days of  Yu-Gi-Oh! , which was slightly confusing because not all of those  monsters  had a  cost .
 Examples of monsters with Ignition Effects: " Cyber Gymnast ", " XYZ-Dragon Cannon ", " Bazoo the Soul-Eater ", " Blackwing - Gale the Whirlwind ", " 3-Hump Lacooda ", " Card Trooper ", " Dark Simorgh ", " Lonefire Blossom ", " XX-Saber Faultroll " and most  Xyz Monsters .
 Post- Problem-Solving Card Text , these type of effects will generally be indicated by "Once per turn:", "You can" or "During your Main Phase:", followed by the cost which will end with a semi-colon(;), and lastly, the actual effect which you activated.
 
 Priority 
 Main article:  Priority 
 Previously, the  turn player  had priority to  activate  Ignition Effects before an opponent could activate a  fast effect . This was removed from the  OCG  on March 19, 2011, and from the  TCG  on April 25, 2012.
 For example, before the abandonment of Ignition Effect priority, the turn player could  Summon  " Lonefire Blossom " and activate its effect before their opponent could activate " Eatgaboon ".
 Since the abandonment of Ignition Effect priority, Ignition Effects cannot be activated in the  Summon response window , requiring an open  game state .
