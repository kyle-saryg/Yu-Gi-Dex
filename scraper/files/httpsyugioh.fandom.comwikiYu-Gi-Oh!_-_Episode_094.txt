 Summary 
 Although  Kaiba  fights well against  Ishizu , she still is unfazed by him thanks to her Millennium Item. When Ishizu has him cornered and nearly out decked, it seems that her vision will come true and that Kaiba will be defeated. Suddenly Kaiba receives a vision of his own from the  Millennium Rod  that might save him from Ishizu.
 
 Major Events 
 Last Duel of the Battle City Quarter-finals. 
 Ishizu uses her  Millennium Necklace  to predict Seto's moves. 
 Seto tries to use " Obelisk the Tormentor ", but the  Millennium Rod  activates, telling him the only way to defeat Ishizu is by using the " Blue-Eyes White Dragon ". 
 This is the only Duel of the Battle City Quarter-finals in which the loser does not end up in a coma. 
       "Obelisk the Tormentor"     
 Notes 
 In the English dub, even after Kaiba used "Soul Exchange" to summon "Obelisk the Tormentor", it's seen again when Kaiba is considering using the "Blue-Eyes White Dragon" instead. 
       "Obelisk" destroyed as expected     
 In the English dub, when Mokuba is translating the text, a Life Point noise is heard before he heads out to check on Kaiba's duel. 
 Featured Duel: Seto Kaiba vs. Ishizu Ishtar, Part 2 
 Duel continued from previous episode. 
 Ishizu has 2400  Life Points  remaining and controls one set card.
 Kaiba has 2950 Life Points remaining and controls "Dark Gremlin" (1600/1800) in Attack Position and one set card.
 Turn 11: Kaiba 
 Kaiba   activates  his face-down " Virus Cannon " to  send  all  Magic Cards  in  Ishizu 's  Deck  and  hand  to her  Graveyard . Ishizu  pays  1000  Life Points  (Ishizu 2400 → 1400) in order to activate her face-down " Exchange of the Spirit ", which switches the cards in both duelists' Decks with those in their Graveyards. This leaves Kaiba with six cards in his Deck while Ishizu gets back every card that Kaiba made her send to the Graveyard.
 Turn 12: Ishizu 
Ishizu draws " Kelbek " and subsequently  Normal Summons  it (1500/1800) in  Attack Position . She then  Sets  a card.
 Turn 13: Kaiba 
Kaiba draws "Virus Cannon" and subsequently activates it, but Ishizu activates her face-down " Muko " to  negate  the  effect  of "Virus Cannon" and  destroy  it.
 Turn 14: Ishizu 
Ishizu draws " Zolga " and subsequently Normal Summons it (1700/1200) in Attack Position. "Zolga"  attacks  and  destroys  " Dark Gremlin " (Kaiba 2950 → 2850). "Kelbek" then  attacks  directly (Kaiba 2850 → 1350). Ishizu Sets a card.
 Turn 15: Kaiba 
Kaiba's hand contains " The Flute of Summoning Dragon ", "Silent Doom", "Blue-Eyes White Dragon", " Soul Exchange ", " Ring of Destruction ", and "Obelisk the Tormentor". Kaiba  draws  "Crush Card" [Notes 1] , but Ishizu activates her face-down "Muko" to  send  the drawn card to the Graveyard. Kaiba Sets a card ("Soul Exchange"). Kaiba intends to activate his set card once Ishizu gets three monsters out onto her field.
 Turn 16: Ishizu 
Ishizu draws. She then Sets a card (" Sacrifice's Blast "). In the anime, Ishizu reveals (to the viewers, thinking to herself) that this Trap has already begun infusing its power into one of Ishizu's monsters ("Zolga"), so that when Kaiba uses "Soul Exchange" to seize its control and tribute it, it will be transferred to the Tribute Summoned monster i.e. Kaiba's " Obelisk the Tormentor ". Once Seto attacks directly with "Obelisk", the effect of "Sacrifice's Blast" will activate, defeating Kaiba. Ishizu Normal Summons " Agido " (1500/1300) in Attack Position. Kaiba activates his face-down "Soul Exchange" to allow himself to Tribute his opponents' monsters as if he was their controller. Kaiba then Tributes "Zolga", "Kelbek", and "Agido" in order to  Tribute Summon  "Obelisk the Tormentor" (4000/4000) in Attack Position.
 Turn 17: Kaiba 
Kaiba draws " Polymerization ". He prepares to use "Obelisk the Tormentor" to attack directly, but  Yami Marik 's  Millennium Rod  activates and gives Kaiba a vision of the past. He sees himself as an  ancient priest  carrying a  woman  while standing in front of a stone tablet showing the "Blue-Eyes White Dragon". This convinces him to change his strategy. 
 Kaiba then activates " Silent Doom " to revive " Gadget Soldier " (1800/2000) in  Defense Position . He then Tributes "Gadget Soldier" and "Obelisk the Tormentor" in order to Tribute Summon " Blue-Eyes White Dragon " (3000/2500) in Attack Position (thus  negating  the "Sacrifice's Blast" secretly infused in "Obelisk"). "Blue-Eyes White Dragon" attacks directly (Ishizu 1400 → 0).
 
 Differences In Adaptations 
 The 5 pointed star on " Muko " is given more points in the dub. 
 As before, " Virus Cannon " is changed from a Magic to a Trap Card in the dub. 
 " Sacrifice's Blast " was shown to be in Kaiba's hand. 
 Kaiba's thought that he'll be humiliated (fear of failure in the original) comes after Ishizu sets a card. This is the other way around in the original Japanese version. 
 Dark Gremlin's destruction is obscured. 
 In the Japanese dub, Kaiba was about to give up but Yami Yugi encouraged him to keep fighting as he saw a future where the both of them would fight in the tournament. In the English dub, Yami Yugi tried to convince Kaiba to accept his predestined loss because there's much more at stake due to the damage Marik and his minions have caused and it is implied Yami Yugi doesn't believe Kaiba has the ability to defeat Marik due to not having a Millennium Item.
