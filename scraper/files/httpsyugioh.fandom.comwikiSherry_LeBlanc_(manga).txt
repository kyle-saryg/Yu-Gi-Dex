 Biography 
 History 
 Sherry attended the  Duel Academy Sanctuary , an academy located in central  New Domino City  which attracted many Psychic Duelists. Here, Sherry met  Akiza Izinski , another psychic Duelist and the two of them were deemed the best among all other students there. Akiza chose to leave the academy due to its elitist ways [2] , which made Sherry feel betrayed and harbor a hatred for Akiza. [1] 
 
 Yu-Gi-Oh! 5D's 
       The silhouette of Sherry and other contestants.     
 Sherry's silhouette is shown as one of the Duelists entering the  D1 Grand Prix  when  Lazar  explains the tournament to  Yusei Fudo  after he is defeated by  Jack Atlas . [3]  She attends the opening ceremonies for the tournament and angrily looks on as Jack insults her and the other contestants. [4] 
 During the first round of the tournament, Lazar sees to it that Sherry and Akiza Duel first so he and  Rex Goodwin  can view their psychic abilities. Sherry manages to take an early lead by using her "Hand Scan" ability on Akiza, forcing her to discard her entire hand. She then tells Akiza that she can never forgive her for running away from the Duel Academy Sanctuary. [1]  Sherry attempts to get Akiza to see the error of her ways by telling her that elite Duelists like her belong at the Duel Academy Sanctuary and despite Akiza telling Sherry the reasons for why she left, she continues to view Akiza as in the wrong. As the Duel continues, Sherry's "Hand Scan" ability takes it's toll on Akiza, forcing her into a  Lockdown . Sherry continues at full force, managing to Summon her  ace , " Klaret the Elite Magic Elf " which when used in combination with her Lockdown strategy, has 4000  ATK . Akiza begins to give up hope, but after being cheered on by her friends, decides to draw with her eyes closed, allowing her to avoid Sherry's Lockdown combination. She then manages to Summon her " Fallen Angel of Roses " and defeat Sherry. [2]  After the Duel, Sherry and Akiza become friends again after Sherry questions Akiza on where she learned to drive a  Duel Runner  with her eyes closed (which causes Akiza to fall to the ground out of shock as she realized what she had done). [5] 
 
 Deck 
 Sherry  uses a  " Magic Elf " Deck  which is based around guessing cards in the opponent's hand. She uses a  Lockdown  of " Mokusatsu " and " Name Erasure " which won't fail due to her " Hand Scan " ability.
