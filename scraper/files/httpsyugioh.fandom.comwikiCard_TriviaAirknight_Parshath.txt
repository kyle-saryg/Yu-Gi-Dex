 This card has two upgraded versions, " Neo-Parshath, the Sky Paladin " and " Sacred Arch-Airknight Parshath ", a  DARK  counterpart, " Darknight Parshath ", a  Synchro  counterpart, " Avenging Knight Parshath " and a  Link  counterpart " Celestial Knightlord Parshath ". 
 This card is the opposite of " Mefist the Infernal General " in a number of ways. This monster is a  LIGHT   Fairy  and Mefist is a DARK  Fiend . While both monsters have the Pierce effect, when they inflict damage, this card allows you to draw 1 card while "Mefist" forces your opponent to discard. However, "Mefist" does not have a upgraded version of itself while this card has. 
 This card is named after the mythological character  Perseus , but the name was mistranslated (Pa-Shi-Ah-Su). 
 This card is the one of the few cards to not have its halo removed in editing, another being " Belial - Marquis of Darkness ". 
 This card appears in the artworks of " Tuner's Mind " and " Rebirth of Parshath ". 
 Its appearance in the anime has its shield mistakenly drawn upside-down.
