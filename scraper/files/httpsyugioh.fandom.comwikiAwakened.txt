 Effects 
       Yuya awakened     
 This ability causes Yuya and his dimensional counterparts to go into a state of rage, and their eyes to white out and glow. This usually occurs in a Duel invoking the  Four Dimension Dragons  where the dragons overtake their owner's mind or when the user is sufficiently angered, and its activation is usually accompanied by an excruciating amount of pain. It is also possible to force the activation of the ability by forcefully amplifying the aggressiveness of the user through electrical shocks. The activation of Yuya's awakening is depicted by the opening of an eye, followed by the instant annihilation of a  shadowed city . [3] 
 While Yuya and his counterparts are awakened, they are willing to harm or destroy their opponent in order to win the Duel. When they regain their senses, they generally have no knowledge of what happened while they were awakened unless prompted. [4]  If they are awakened while merged with one of their counterparts, they become vulnerable to being influenced by that counterpart's own memories and desires. [5] 
 
       Awakening I     
 In Stage I, Yuya's irises glow but he remains in control. He is shown to enter this stage while Xyz Summoning " Odd-Eyes Rebellion Dragon " with a conscious mind. Though he has entered Stage I during the  Friendship Cup  whenever Yugo dueled, causing them to synch thoughts with each other. Yuya accidentally causes this version of Stage I by examining  Odd-Eyes Pendulum Dragon  when it glows.
 
         Awakening II     
 In Stage II, Yuya becomes collected and cold, speaking no more than necessary. Additionally, his hair becomes wild and his voice deeper (his voice remains the same pitch in the dub, though it becomes rougher), both his iris and pupils glow and mute any natural shine to them. He is occasionally surrounded by a dark aura, and his card also become darker. [6]  Yuya entered this state due to the beating he was taking from Iggy Arlo, metaphorically and literally. 
 
         Awakening III     
 In Stage III, Yuya's hair sticks upwards, his pupils glow white, and he is constantly surrounded by a  dark aura . He also becomes vicious and even sadistic, shown by his ruthlessness while Dueling the  Obelisk Force  and continued to thrash about while restrained by his friends. He is also capable of unleashing powerful shockwaves that are beyond normal for a person originating from the Standard Dimension. [7] 
 
         Awakening IV     
 In Stage IV, Yuya's pupils will glow even brighter and all of his counterparts will gain the same dark aura around them if they are in sync with Yuya. Yuya's anger in this stage grows to an almost primal rage that he becomes impervious to reason. Anything he is in contact with also gains a dark aura, in the same manner as Yuya. This stage takes such a toll on their bodies and minds that their eyes become dull and empty as the glow fades, though Yuya's eyes become brown instead, and all of them pass out afterwards. [8] 
 
         Awakening V.     
 In Stage V, Yuya's eyes become completely red. Yuya is surrounded by dark aura and starts behaving like Z-ARC, wanting to show his own strength and ruthlessness to his opponents for his own pleasure. (In the Dub, he even starts sounding like Z-Arc) Though Yuya's own goals still drive him at the base level. This stage is the closest stage to Z-ARC's Awakening. [2] 
 
         Awakening VI.     
 In Stage VI, Yuya's pupils become white, his hair once again stick upwards, and he is surrounded by a thicker dark aura. At this level of extreme rage, Yuya somewhat gained unnatural strength as he broke free from " Binding Swords of Impact ". [9] 
 
         Awakening VII.     
 In Stage VII, Yuya's eyes completely white out and glow red like his counterparts. He is constantly surrounded by a dark aura and instantly releases intense shockwaves of darkness from it. This stage takes a toll on Yuya's mind as Yuri, Yuto, and Yugo kept shouting to become one at Yuya while awakened and all  Four Dimension Dragons  were out. This also caused Yuya to forget who he was momentarily and he needed help to remember from Declan. [10] 
 
         Awakening VIII, the final stage.     
 In the Final Stage, Stage VIII Z-ARC takes complete control over Yuya whose face takes a sinister appearance, sprouting veins and a wicked smile. His pupils become slit, like Yuri's, before glowing red and completely whiting out. The dark aura also flares up and overflows around him until the fusion between his counterparts and dragons are complete. [10] 
 Jean-Michel Roget  is somewhat aware of the awakenings, as he intensified the power of the  chip  he implanted in Yuya's helmet to awaken the ability. [3] 
 The Doktor  was also shown that  Parasite Monsters  can be repelled, as it invoked Yuya's awakening for a moment, allowing The Darkness to immediately neutralize and destroy it. [11] 
 When Yuya and all four of his counterparts are in the same place at the same time when awakened, a distortion appears in the sky and they continuously declare that they will reunite as one (phrased as "become one" in the Japanese version). [12] [13] 
 
 Biography 
 History 
         Z-ARC awakened when he became Supreme Dragon Z-ARC.     
 When  Z-ARC  fused with his  four dragons  using  Astrograph Sorcerer , he awakened when they became Supreme King Z-ARC. [14] 
 
 Pre-Arc League Championship 
 The very first instance of awakening occurred in Yuya's Duel against  the Sledgehammer , during which Z-ARC's will reacted to Yuya and turned several of his Monsters into  Pendulum Monsters , which had been created when Z-ARC was divided into four. [15]  After the Duel concluded, Yuya snapped out of that state and did not remember what he did. [16]  Unlike the other instances of awakening, Yuya's eyes did not glow and the only change was him becoming more confident and serious, lacking any rage-filled desire to annihilate his opponent.
 
 Arc League Championship 
         Yugo and Yuto awakened.     
 Awakening was properly introduced during the Duel between Yuto and Yugo. When Yuto  Xyz Summoned  his " Dark Rebellion Xyz Dragon " and Yugo  Synchro Summoned  his " Clear Wing Synchro Dragon " their eyes glowed. After being reminded by Yuya that he didn't want to hurt anyone, Yuto came out of his awakening but lost to Yugo a moment later, who remained gripped by the state until after his victory and didn't quite remember what he'd done. [4] 
 Later in his Duel against  Iggy Arlo , Yuto appeared in Yuya's mind and the two merged, causing Yuya to awaken and use Yuto's "Dark Rebellion Xyz Dragon" to win the Duel. When Yuya regained his senses, he was met with concerned stares from the audience and disdain from Iggy. [6] 
 During his Duel against  Taka  and  Nagi , "Dark Rebellion" appeared in Yuya's mind and he would have awakened had his ally,  Dennis McField , not managed to bring him back to his senses before it fully consumed him. Though Yuya did summon "Dark Rebellion", he was able to remain in control for the remainder of the Duel. [17] 
 
         Yuya, awakened, challenging the Obelisk Force.     
 After seeing the  Knights of the Duel Disks  students being turned into cards by the  Obelisk Force , Yuto's memories of  when Heartland was invaded  and his vengeful hatred towards the  Fusion Dimension  flooded into Yuya's mind, triggering Yuya to awaken again to take revenge on them. This time, Yuya's awakening took on a whole different level; Yuya became more brutal and even enjoyed inflicting damage to his opponents. [5]  During the Duel against the Obelisk Force, Yuya progressively became more malicious and violent, becoming surrounded by a dark aura, and ultimately he summoned " Odd-Eyes Rebellion Dragon " to defeat them all at once. After winning the Duel, he remained awakened and continued to where  Sora  and  Shay  were dueling, but was restrained by  Gong ,  Aura ,  Reed , and  Trout . While restrained, Yuya only kept on yelling violently in pain and struggling to escape (biting and uppercutting Trout) until passing out. Aura was able to determine that there were two souls within Yuya, along with a  terrifying darkness . Yuto's soul was the one who initially triggered the awakening, but the darkness eventually took over both souls and caused their anger to intensify. After resting, Yuya returned to normal and was consciously informed of this state, along with what he had been doing while awakened and what Aura had discovered. [7] 
 When Yuya saw his friends being  sealed   into   cards  by the Obelisk Force, he briefly awakened once more and chased after Sora. After reaching Sora, Yuya recalled Yuto's words and managed to calm down. [18] 
 
 Friendship Cup 
         Awakened Yuya during his Duel with Officer 227.     
 Goaded by Declan in their Duel, Yuya was about to awaken again before snapping out of it on his own. [19]  He briefly awaken again during his Duel against  Officer 227 , and though he snapped out of it soon enough, Yuya retained the serious demeanor throughout the rest of the Duel. [20] 
 
         Yuya awakened again.     
 During the rematch between Dennis and Shay, Yuya briefly awakened again after learning about the former's affiliation with  Duel Academy , (due to Yuto's anger influencing him again) but he managed to control his anger and snapped out of it. [21] 
 
 
 Friendship Cup Finals 
         Yuya and his counterparts all awakened at the same time.     
 When the  chip   Roget  planted inside Yuya's helmet activated during Yuya's Duel with  Crow Hogan , Yuto, Yugo, and  Yuri   synchronized  with Yuya's pain and all four became awakened. [3]  When Yuya Summoned "Odd-Eyes Rebellion Dragon", his eyes glowed brighter while Yugo and Yuri started to gain dark auras around themselves. When Yuya won the Duel, all of them passed out and the chip was destroyed in the process. [8] 
 The state was invoked again when Yuri, the Obelisk Force, and Yugo arrived at Yuya's location. With Yuya controlling " Odd-Eyes Pendulum Dragon " and "Dark Rebellion Xyz Dragon in his Duel with  Barrett  and Yugo and Yuri summoning their "Clear Wing" and " Starving Venom Fusion Dragon " respectively, all of the  Four Dimension Dragons  were in play at the same time, causing Yuya and his counterparts awakened and synchronize again. [22]  After entering both states, Yuya, Yuto, Yugo, and Yuri started shouting that they waited for this time to become one and for a revival. But before the distortion caused by their dragons finished, Zuzu arrived and her  bracelet  teleported Yugo and Yuri away while Yuto's consciousness sank away. [12]

         Yuya's demonic expression during his Duel with Lulu and Celina.     
 During his Duel with  Lulu  and  Celina , a  Parasite Monster  landed on Yuya's shoulder and went inside his ear, attempting to take control of him. However, it caused him to awaken for a brief moment as the Darkness destroyed it. After  the Doktor  taunted Yuya by showing that Zuzu was under his control, Yuya and Yuto furiously awakened. The intense anger of their awakening caused the " Fusion Parasites " to retreat in fear, while a sinister silhouette appeared behind Yuya. They summoned " Odd-Eyes Raging Dragon " to defeat both Lulu and Celina simultaneously, destroying most of the Doktor's laboratory in the process. After the Duel, Yuya remained conscious and followed them to the Doktor. [11] 
 
 
 Duel Academy 
         Yugo awakened before being absorbed by Yuri.     
 When Yugo and Yuri summoned "Clear Wing" and "Starving Venom" respectively, they, Yuya, and Yuto entered a  synchronized  awakening (with Yuya gaining his aura again) and started shouting that they would become one again. [13]  When  ARC-V  started to power up around the girls capsule, Yuya and Yuto was worried and angrily told  Leo  to stop this, causing them to awaken and gain dark auras. He and Yuto manage to overcome the pain including  Z-ARC 's influence but Yuya returned to the state when  Fusion Summoning  " Performapal Gatling Ghoul ". [2]  During the Duel, Yuya managed to fight most of the pain and even make brief contact to Declan with Yuto. But, Z-ARC's will continued to try to take over and when the  Four Dimension Dragons  were all out at the same time, Yuya's pain increased with his dark aura turning into a dragon's silhouette. As he Summoned " Odd-Eyes Raging Dragon ", Yuya destroyed everything on the field and inflicting damage to Declan unintentionally. As he was about to defeat Leo and Declan,  Yusho  bound him to a pillar with " Binding Swords of Impact ".

Aster managed to free Yugo from his awakening with " Destiny HERO - Dusktopia ", but Yuri told him it was too late to get him to smile. He then defeated Aster and Kite with the effect of " Greedy Venom Fusion Dragon " [25]  and Yugo with the effect of "Starving Venom". [26]  When "Clear Wing" and "Starving Venom" resonated, Yugo awakened briefly and shouted to become one just before being absorbed by Yuri. Yuya resonated with Yuri's absorption but started to break free of his awakening when watching his father Duel Yuri. [27]  He broke free from it completely during their Duel but reawaken again when Yuri sealed his father into a  card  and showed it to Yuya, causing his rage to reach a breaking point, who then broke free from "Binding Swords of Impact". [9]

[28]  When Yuri tried to convince Yuya to surrender and become one with him, he briefly awakened while he, Yuto, and Yugo kept shouting to become one. It also caused Yuya to awaken and release a shockwave of darkness until Declan made him remember Yusho's ideals to break free. Yuto and Yugo would also break free from their awakening when Yuya took control of "Dark Rebellion" and "Clear Wing" from Yuri.

Yuri would also awaken briefly before being absorbed by Yuya to become Supreme King Z-ARC. [10] 
 Yuya and his counterparts would lose the ability to awaken after  Riley  removed Z-ARC's soul from their bodies. [29] 
 
 Trivia 
 Before Awakened had an official name, fans would call this ability "Berserk Mode". 
 Yuya is the only one of Z-ARC's fragments to not have his eyes completely glow until Z-ARC's influence had taken over Yugo and Yuto with Yuri willing to reunite. This could be due to Yuya representing the polar opposite of Z-ARC' insanity with his pure desire to bring smiles. 
 Yuri was only influenced once, afterwards he desired to gain the "powers" of Synchro, Xyz and Pendulum; unaware Z-ARC would dominate him instead.
