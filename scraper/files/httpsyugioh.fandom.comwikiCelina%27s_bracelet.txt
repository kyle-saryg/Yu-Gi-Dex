 Appearance 
       The bracelet at a different angle     
 It is a thin, metal bracelet which seems to have a slightly larger circumference than Celina's wrist. It consists of two rings, with the smaller ring locked into the larger one by two metal loops on either side. A single purple, star-shaped gem sits on the bottom of the smaller ring in the center of a metal platform that allows the gem to rotate back and forth inside of the smaller ring.
 The metallic bands intersecting create a moon-shaped design that is additionally reminiscent of  Fusion Materials . Said design might also be inspired by "the traditional themes of natural beauty in Japanese aesthetics" ( 花 鳥 風 月 ), referencing the " 月 " (moon) for Celina and her  Lunalight  deck.
 
 Abilities 
 Like  Zuzu's bracelet , the jewel on Celina's bracelet will blink in warning when  Yuya  and all of his  counterparts  are  synchronized  and  Awakened . [1]  However, unlike Zuzu's bracelet, it does not react when at least two of Yuya's counterparts, including Yuya himself, are in close proximity, and the majority of its abilities remain unknown. [2] 
 
 Biography 
 History 
       Celina's bracelet original form.     
 The bracelet was originally a  card  created by  Leo Akaba  using natural energy from the moon. It was used with the  other   three   cards  to confront  Z-ARC , however,  Ray  took them from her father in order to oppose Z-ARC herself. During the Duel, the card took its shape as the bracelet and appeared on Ray's right arm. Along with the others, the bracelet helped her stop  Supreme King Z-ARC , and split him, along with herself and the  Original Dimension . Later, Celina gained ownership of the bracelet. [3] 
 Following the events of Z-ARC's defeat, Leo traveled to the Fusion Dimension in hopes of finding Ray. However, he discovered Celina and believed her to be Ray due to their appearance and was fully convinced when he notice the bracelet on her wrist. [3] 
 
 Arc League Championship 
 Celina was seen wearing this bracelet when  Declan  grabbed her arm. [4] 
 
 Friendship Cup Finals 
         Celina's bracelet resonating for the first time.     
 During  Yuya 's Duel with  Crow , Celina's bracelet began to react for the first time while she was in  New Domino City  catching the attention of  Moon Shadow  and  Riley  and causing Celina to wonder what is going on. It also resonated along with Zuzu's when Yuya both  synchronized  and  Awakened  along with his  counterparts  after  Roget  activated the  chip  secretly installed in Yuya's helmet. [5]  After Yuya won the Duel, the bracelet stopped resonating. [1] 
 
         Celina's bracelet resonating stronger.     
 Celina's bracelet began to resonate again at the same time Zuzu's did and after the  Four Dimension Dragons  were on the field in the same place. The resonance of the two bracelets began to glow stronger when Yuya and his counterparts awakened and synchronized again. [2]  Their resonance ended again when Zuzu arrived at Yuya's location and her bracelet teleported  Yugo  and  Yuri  away who were near him. [6] 
 
 Duel Academy 
         Riley with the Natural Energy Bracelets.     
 When Celina was transferred into  ARC-V [7] , her bracelet returned to its  card form . It was then taken with the  other   three   cards  by  Leo  to use against  Z-ARC  again, but they were  destroyed  by Z-ARC, who defeated Leo. [8]  However, using  Riley 's body,  Ray  retrieved the  Natural Energy Cards  from the  Graveyard  and activated them to slowly strip away " Supreme King Z-ARC 's" protection effects and causing the  Natural Energy Bracelets  to materialize on Riley's arm. With  Yuya 's  help , Ray defeated Z-ARC again with the effects of the Natural Energy Cards and Riley sealed away Z-ARC's spirit within her own body to prevent his soul from being split again. [9] 
 Following the battle against Z-ARC and the  Standard Dimension 's rebirth into the  "Pendulum Dimension" , the bracelet disappeared following Riley's regression into an infant. [10]
