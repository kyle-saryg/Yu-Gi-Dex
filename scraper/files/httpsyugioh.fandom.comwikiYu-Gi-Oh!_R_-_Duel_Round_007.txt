 "There Goes Jonouchi" , known as  "Jonouchi Again!!  in the Japanese version, is the seventh chapter of the  Yu-Gi-Oh! R  manga. It was first printed in Japan on October 21, 2004 in  V Jump  magazine. It was later reprinted in volume 1 of Yu-Gi-Oh! R.
 Jonouchi  and  Honda  attempt to make their way back up to the upper floors. They are blocked by  Pete Coppermine , the next  card professor .
 
 Featured Duel: Katsuya Jounouchi vs. Pete Coppermine 
 Turn 1: Jonouchi 
 Jonouchi  draws. He then  Sets  a card and  Normal Summons  " Little-Winguard " (1400/1800) in  Defense Position .
 Turn 2: Pete 
 Pete  draws. He then Normal Summons " Para Mutant " (1800/1500) in Attack Position and Sets a card.
 Turn 3: Jonouchi 
Jonouchi draws. He then Normal Summons " Panther Warrior " (2000/1600). "Panther Warrior"  attacks  "Para Mutant", but Pete  activates  his  face-down  " Gem of Lycanthropy ", turning "Para Mutant" into " Lycanthrope " (2300/1600). It becomes the new attack  target , so "Panther Warrior" is  destroyed  (Jonouchi 4000 → 3700). Jonouchi Sets a card.
 Turn 4: Pete 
Pete draws. He then activates " All-Seeing Eye " from his hand, allowing him to check Jonouchi's Set cards (" Pit Trap " and " Relentless Attacks "). Pete Sets a card. He then Tributes "Lycanthrope" to Normal Summon " Mutant Mindmaster " (0/2500) in Attack Position. "Mutant Mindmaster" attacks "Little-Winguard", which activates "Mindmaster"'s effect, allowing Pete to take  control  of "Little-Winguard" until the End Phase. "Little-Winguard" attacks Jonouchi  directly  (Jonouchi 3700 → 2300). At the end of the  Battle Phase , "Little-Winguard" returns to Jonouchi's control.
 Turn 5: Jonouchi 
Jonouchi draws. He then Sets a card. He Tributes "Little-Winguard" to Normal Summon " Divine Knight Ishzark " (2300/1800) in Attack Position. "Ishzark" attacks "Mutant Mindmaster", but Pete activates his face-down " Teletemporate ",  removing  "Mutant Mindmaster" from play until his next  Main Phase  and  negating  the attack.
 Turn 6: Pete 
Pete draws. At his Main Phase, "Mutant Mindmaster" returns to the field by the effect of "Teletemporate". "Mindmaster" attacks "Ishzark" (with Pete intending to use "Mindmaster"'s effect to take control of Ishzark and eliminate Joey's Life Points), but Jonouchi activates his face-down " Graverobber ", activating "Teletemporate" from Pete's Graveyard. "Ishzark" is removed from play and the attack is negated.
 Turn 7: Jonouchi 
Joey draws. At his Main Phase, "Ishzark" returns to the field. "Ishzark" attacks and destroys "Mutant Mindmaster" (Pete 4000 → 1700). Jonouchi activates his face-down "Relentless Attacks", allowing "Ishzark" to attack again this turn. "Ishzark" attacks directly (Pete 1700 → 0).
