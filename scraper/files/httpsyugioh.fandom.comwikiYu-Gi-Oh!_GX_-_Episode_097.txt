 Summary 
 Blinded by vengeance and his obsession to find the "Ultimate Destiny" card,  Aster Phoenix  wins Duel after Duel, but his frustration grows considerably, due to his failure in locating the card.  While Aster is on his endless crusade,  Chancellor Sheppard  and  Maximillion Pegasus  discuss the same situation regarding the missing "Ultimate Destiny" card.  At the same time the card was created,  Industrial Illusions  detected a white hole emanating from outer space.  This white hole exuded a powerful Light, which was able to trigger destruction whenever it appeared, and, according to Pegasus, it could be connected to the days of Ancient Egypt, the known origin of Duel Monsters, and was responsible for many disasters across time and space, as well as throughout history.  Now, this " Light of Destruction " has fused itself with a card—the "Ultimate Destiny" card that Aster is looking for—and Aster believes that whoever has that card is also the person who killed ("kidnapped" in the English dub) his father.
 Meanwhile,  Jaden Yuki  and  Tyranno Hassleberry  are excited to see the latest playoff Championship Duel, where the mysterious champion known as " The D " finally reveals himself, but during his  Duel  with  Dr. Collector , after revealing that he is possessed by  The Light of Destruction  and playing his "ultimate card", as he stated, the television signal is suddenly lost during the broadcast, so no one knows the outcome of the duel or what happened to The D and Dr. Collector.  Later, Aster confronts The D on his private yacht, and The D reveals that he is the person responsible for the death ("disappearance" in the English dub) of Aster's father and the theft of the "Ultimate Destiny" card. With that, he shuts all the exits and traps them both inside.
 
 Featured Duel: The D vs. Doctor Collector 
 Turn 1: The D 
 The D  draws " Enigma the Creator " and subsequently Normal Summons it (1200/1200) in  Defense Position . He then  Sets  a card.
 Turn 2: Dr. Collector 
 Doctor Collector  draws " Dimensional Fissure " and subsequently activates it. Now any  monster  sent to the  Graveyard  will be  removed from play  instead. Doctor Collector then activates " Graceful Charity " to  draw three cards  and  discard  " Cosmo Queen " and " Magician's Valkyria ".
 Doctor Collector then activates " Magical Stone Excavation " to discard "Magician's Valkyria" and " Monster Reincarnation " and add "Graceful Charity" from his Graveyard to his hand. Doctor Collector then activates "Graceful Charity" again to  draw three more cards  and  discard  " Ebon Magician Curran " and "Magician's Valkyria". Due to the effect of "Dimensional Fissure", both discarded cards are removed from play. 
 Doctor Collector then activates " Dimension Fusion " to  pay  2000  Life Points  (Doctor Collector 4000 → 2000) and allow himself and  the D  to  Special Summon  as many of their removed from play  monsters  as possible. Doctor Collector  Special Summons  "Cosmo Queen" (2900/2450), three "Magician's Valkyrias" (1600/1800), and "Ebon Magician Curran" (1200/0) in Attack Position while the D Special Summons no monsters due to the D having no monsters in his  Removed from Play Zone . Since Doctor Collector now has three "Magician's Valkyria", an attack lock has been formed. 
 "Cosmo Queen" attacks "Enigma the Creator", but  The D  activates his face-down " Negate Attack " to negate the attack and end the Battle Phase. Doctor Collector then activates " Magical Blast " to inflict 200  damage  to  the D  for each  Spellcaster  that he  controls . Doctor Collector has five Spellcaster-type monsters (The D 4000 → 3000). Doctor Collector then  Sets  one card (" Nightmare Wheel ").
 Turn 3: The D 
The D draws. He then activates two copies of " Fiend's Sanctuary " to  Special Summon  two " Metal Fiend Tokens " (0/0 each) to his side of the  field  in Attack Position. The D then activates " D - Force " and places the latter  face-up  on top of his  Deck . While "D - Force" is the top card of the D's  Deck , he cannot conduct his  normal draw  during his  Draw Phase . The D then  Tributes  "Enigma the Creator" and his two "Metal Fiend Tokens" in order to  Special Summon  " Destiny Hero - Plasma " (1900/600) in Attack Position.
 (Note: At this point, due to "Destiny Hero - Plasma", a massive explosion suddenly rocks the Kaiba Dome, abruptly cutting off the reception and not revealing the final outcome of the duel. Later in the episode, before Aster's duel with the D, the rest of his duel with Doctor Collector is told by him in a flashback. The full appearance and effects of "Plasma" and "D - Force" however, are not revealed until the next episode.)
 The D then activates the effect of "Destiny Hero - Plasma" to equip itself with "Cosmo Queen" and increase the ATK of "Plasma" by half the ATK of "Cosmo Queen" ("Plasma": 1900 → 3350/600). Since "D - Force" is the top card of  The D 's  Deck , "Destiny Hero - Plasma" negates the effects of all face-up  Effect Monsters  that  Doctor Collector  controls. 
 "Destiny Hero - Plasma" attacks "Ebon Magician Curran", but  Doctor Collector  activates his face-down "Nightmare Wheel" and targets "Plasma" for its effect, however since "D - Force" is the top card of the D's Deck, "Plasma" is immune to Doctor Collector's  Spells  and  Traps . "Plasma" then destroys "Ebon Magician Curran" (Doctor Collector 2000 → 0).
 
 Mistakes in the English dub 
 The announcer of the  Pro League  Duel stated that  The D  had returned after four years of inactivity to defend his championship title, but the dialogue is later changed to "ten years". 
 When Bonaparte explains the effect of " Ebon Magician Curran ", he states that  The D  would lose 300  Life Points  whenever he summoned a monster, when actually, this effect would occur during Collector's  Standby Phase , and for each monster that The D controlled. 
 In the flashback during the Duel, " Archfiend of Gilfer " was on The D's  Duel Disk  instead of " Plasma " and "D - Force" was not at the top of his deck.
