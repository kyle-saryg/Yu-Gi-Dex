 Summary 
 At the Collectible Card Games division of the  KaibaCorp  Research & Development,  Kaiba  stands in an arena across from a robotic  Duel Computer .  Mokuba  and a number of KaibaCorp employees, including  Chief Kuwabara , observe from the control room.
 
       Kaiba  faces the  Duel Computer .     
 Kaiba puts on his new model of  Duel Disk , ready to test it. Unlike the last model, this one doesn't need to be thrown. Once the card is placed in the arm plate, its data is scanned and a  Solid Vision  hologram is created. He thinks to himself that  Yugi  is the only Duelist he recognizes as a rival, only he and Yugi have true pride and when the new Duel Disk is perfected, a new battle for them will begin. He does not care if it is Yugi who is on the  tablet  that he saw at the museum; he is only interested in the enemy in front of him. Even if Yugi is the embodiment of the Pharaoh, who seeking the honor of the past, Kaiba announces that he shall take the glory of the future.
 Kuwabara sets the Duel Computer's tactics to max. He says that he's unsure if Kaiba can beat the computer. Mokuba yells at him for his statement, but Kuwabara informs him that the computer is using Kaiba's own Deck that he used during  Duelist Kingdom . Upon hearing this even Mokuba becomes a bit anxious, realizing his brother is up against his ultimate Deck.
 Kaiba adds his new Deck to his Duel Disk, recalling that the card  Ishizu  gave him is in it. This Duel shall not just a test of the new model Duel Disk, he thinks, but it is also a test of " The God of the Obelisk ". He wonders how it will fare against the Deck containing three " Blue-Eyes White Dragons " that he spent so many years perfecting. He shouts over to the control room to get started, and Kuwabara switches on the Auto Duel system and the Duel Machine.
 
       The holograms of Kaiba's  hand  appear before him.     
 Solid Vision holograms of the cards in each player's  hand  appear in front of each Duelist, with their backs facing their opponents. The Duel Computer begins its turn and  Summons  a  monster  in  Attack Mode . Kaiba yells at it to bring it on. The monster is " Blue-Eyes White Dragon ", whose hologram appears in font of the machine. Mokuba is worried that it's managed to bring out a "Blue-Eyes White Dragon" on the first turn and shouts at Kaiba to watch out.
 Kaiba starts his turn. Three of the cards in his  hand  are visible; " Steel Ogre Grotto #2 ", " Invitation to a Dark Sleep " and " Negate Attack ". He  Sets  a card in the  Spell & Trap Card Zone  and Summons the Evil Mesmerist, " Invitation to a Dark Sleep " in  Defense Mode .
 The Duel Computer assess the threat and begins its turn. Kaiba sees that the computer isn't attacking because it is cautious of his  face-down  card. Although it is artificial intelligence, Kaiba believes its tactics are as good as anyone he has ever faced. The computer Summons " Lord of Dragons ". With it on the field, all  Dragons  are immune to magic. Kaiba notes that if the computer had  attacked , "Blue-Eyes White Dragon" would have been put to sleep by the effect of "Invitation to a Dark Sleep", but the computer saw through that.
 
         Kaiba faces the three " Blue-Eyes White Dragons ".     
 On Kaiba's turn, he plays " Steel Ogre Grotto #2 " in Defense Mode. As he ends his turn, " Monster Reborn " is visible in his hand. Mokuba starts to worry that the computer has Kaiba on defense and says that he knew Kaiba's Deck wasn't strong enough.
 The computer starts its turn and plays " The Flute of Summoning Dragon ",  Special Summoning  two more " Blue-Eyes White Dragons ". Kaiba faces the three dragons, thinking that three of them at the same time is the deadliest possible attack. Kuwabara says that Kaiba has had his own combo turned against him and asks if he can defeat three "Blue-Eyes". One of the other employees says that no one can. Kaiba remembers when Yugi faced his three "Blue-Eyes", back in  Death-T . He stood up to them without fear, believed in his cards, took the challenge with courage and won. A Duelist's greatest enemy is a monster in their hearts called fear, Kaiba thinks.
 The computer prepares to attack and Kaiba vows to seize the future. The dragons begin their " Burst Stream of Destruction " attack, but Kaiba plays " Negate Attack " cancelling their attacks.
 
         Kaiba  sacrifices  " Invitation to a Dark Sleep " and " Steel Ogre Grotto #2 " for " Obelisk 's" effect.     
 Kaiba begins his turn and bets everything on his next card. He draws " The God of the Obelisk ", which he immediately Summons. The Egyptian God monster, a blue-skinned winged giant, fills the entire room with its massive bulk, and Mokuba recognizes it as the rare card Kaiba was talking about. During Kaiba's  Battle Phase , he  Sacrifices  two of his monsters and "Obelisk" absorbs their souls. Kuwabara is astonished to see "Obelisk" kill its allies and wonders if that is the cost of power. The other employee points out that "Obelisk's"  Attack Value  is rising rapidly.
 
         "Obelisk" destroys the computer.     
 Kaiba orders "Obelisk" to attack. It uses its "Fist of the Obelisk" to  destroy  the three "Blue-Eyes White Dragons". The Duel Computer explodes, unable to compute the power of "Obelisk", while the panels and computers in the control room start to explode as well. Mokuba celebrates "Obelisk" taking out both the monsters and the computer's  Life Points .
 Two legendary cards remain, Kaiba thinks and no matter what enemy stands in his way, he will find those cards and make them his. Once that day comes, he shall be the King of Duelists.
