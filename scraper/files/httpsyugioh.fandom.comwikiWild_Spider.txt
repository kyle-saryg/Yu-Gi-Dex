 Wild Spider  is one of the 100 different  Monster Fighters . It is used by  Koji Nagumo  in the  manga .
 Koji claimed that his Wild Spider is undefeated and used it in a game against  Yugi . However Koji cheated by punching Yugi and stealing his Monster Fighter equipment.
 Dark Yugi  tracked down Koji and used  Katsuya Jonouchi's  monster,  Killer Emaada  to face Wild Spider again. As the game was a  Shadow Game , which caused the players to take damage instead of their monsters, Koji's face was cracked in the first set, as Wild Spier took a hit. Wild Spider got frozen in the next round. To avoid losing, Koji cheated by kicking Yugi. Dark Yugi then raised the shadow mode to level three. When Koji tried to cheat again, his monsters, including Wild Spider held him down. With Wild Spider at his feat, Koji's monster was replaced with his evil side personified.
