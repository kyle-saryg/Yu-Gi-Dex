 Biography 
 In the thirtieth century B.C., she was a  Duel Priestess  close to  Rex Goodwin . One day, Rex convinced her to lose the  Festival of Duality  on purpose, not telling her about its consequences. Once she follows his wish and loses the  Duel , a kind of eclipse occurred and people started dying, causing a disaster. [1] 
 In the twenty-first century, after  Akiza Izinski 's loss to  Kalin Kessler , Rex meets her and reveals that she was a Duel Priestess in her past life. He then passes a  blank   Duel Dragon  card to her, causing her to obtain her past life's memories and personality. She then becomes the next Duel Priestess. [2] 
 After becoming her successor, Akiza attempted to win the Ritual Duel in order to put an end to Rex and  Roman 's plans and seal  the evil  for once. However, she failed in doing so. [3]
