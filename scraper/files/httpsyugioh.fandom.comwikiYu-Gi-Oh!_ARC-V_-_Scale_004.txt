 Summary 
   This summary is currently incomplete. 
 Having ended up in  Yuya 's hideout, deep within an abandoned water treatment plant,  Yuzu  proceeds to ask Yuya to teach at  Syu Zo Duel School  with a payment of four dollars per hour. But Yuya turns down the offer as he busy searching for a card called  Genesis Omega Dragon , having expected to from some clues from hacking into Leo Corp's  Solid Vision  system. Yuzu, having no idea about the card or its overall significance, reveals the "autograph" she had Yuya signed is actually a legal-binding teaching contract with herself as Yuya's manager. The two then get into a comedic debate over payment before reaching an accord while  Yuto  watches on while expressing that his counterpart and the girl have no idea what each got themselves into.
 At Leo Corp, after a debriefing over  Shingo 's loss,  Sora  attempts to get  Shun 's option over why the three of them were abruptly assembled a month ago to hunt Yuya. But Shun, revealed to have been found by Reiji while satisfying his need to battle in underground duels, is not interested in talking as he is more focused on wiping out the abomination that he considers Yuya's dueling style. While reviewing the footage to find anything he can learn on Yuya, Shun notices Yuzu and recognizes her as a runner-up in a mental arithmetic competition he won years ago. Seeing her as a means to catch Yuya, Shun reaches Syu Zo Duel School and confronts  Syuzo . Later, as Yuzu attempts to give him a catchphrase, Yuya is alerted to an uploaded video from an underground website. Yuya watches the video with Shun revealing that he easily defeated Syuzo and insists Yuya to face him if Yuzu wants to see her father alive again.
