 Biography 
 Zigzix was in charge of monitoring the subjects contained within the  V.S.S.L.  facility. After  Kalin  lost his chance at leaving the facility and becoming  Rex 's  adopted son , he set off an explosive and stole " Jeweled Red Dragon Archfiend " from a safe Zigzix was left in charge of, surprising him. [1] 
 Later, he is revealed to have helped  perform  Sense  tests on Jack. Rex wanted him to increase the power of the Sense inflicted on Jack, but Zigzix hesitated, saying that it could be dangerous to Jack's body. Angry, Rex asked Zigzix if he wanted to change places with Jack then. However, Jack himself declared that those weak Senses couldn't make him fall, and told them to bring the next one. Rex again told Zigzix to increase the level, who obeyed. With this, Jack developed his "Sense Excluder". [2]
