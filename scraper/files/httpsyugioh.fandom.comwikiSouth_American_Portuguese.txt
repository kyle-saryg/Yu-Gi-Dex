South American Portuguese  cards are  Portuguese  cards distributed from Brazil, under the brand  Yu-Gi-Oh! Estampas Ilustradas . They use the new ID,  PT . They follow Brazilian Portuguese, and a few changes in card naming, terminology and text formatting. Some of those changes include adoption of Portuguese terms in place of previous English ones (notably, names of  phases  and  steps ), Brazilian spelling (compare " ativar " in Brazilian cards and "activar" in older Portuguese cards). South American Portuguese cards had a fresh start at the release of  Cosmo Blazer  after a few years of no printings.
