 The  Duel Team Carnival  ( Ｄ・Ｔ・Ｃ   Dyueru Chīmu Kānibaru ) is a tournament for  Dueling Teams  in the  Yu-Gi-Oh! D Team ZEXAL  manga.
 The Duel Team Carnival is a top class tournament for  Dueling Teams  which have already won regional tournaments on their own. [1] 
 In the tournament's edition where  Team ZEXAL  took part in, a riot was caused by someone hacking the  Litterbots , causing the torunament to become a huge mess. [1]  Team ZEXAL found out that it was all caused by  Master Evil  and his henchmen, who planned to ruin the tournament because he was banned from it previously, due to being found out cheating several times. Master Evil was ultimately stopped by Team ZEXAL, however, the tournament was unable to resume due to all the mess caused by Master Evil. [2]
