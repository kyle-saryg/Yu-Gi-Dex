 Have " Terminal World " face-up so that your opponent is forced to Set Spells/Traps before entering the Battle Phase, allowing this card to destroy them if attacked while face-down. It also prevents access to the cards your opponent would draw, until their next turn.
 This card can also be used to destroy your own Set Spells/Traps, such as " Dark Coffin ", " Statue of the Wicked ", " Z-ONE ", " Wild Tornado " and " Artifact " monsters set in the  Spell & Trap Zones . 
 Traditional Format 
 This card can be searched by " Block Dragon " and " Last Will ".
