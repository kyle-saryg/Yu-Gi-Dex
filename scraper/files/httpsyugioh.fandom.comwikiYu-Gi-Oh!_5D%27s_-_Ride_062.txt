 Summary 
 Goodwin , with 3000  LP , announces that this is the final attack as " Ancient Pixie Dragon " attacks the 1300  ATK  " Stardust Spark Dragon ", and  Yusei , on 300 LP himself, apologizes to the  Duel Dragons  for being unable to live up to their hopes. Tears fall from his eyes onto his  Duel Disk , and "Stardust's" eyes snaps open and it roars and flexes its muscles, shattering both the thorns impaling it and its own " Sonic Barrier ".  Sect  and  Akiza  are shocked that "Stardust" moved on its own as "Stardust" throws itself between "Ancient" and Yusei. The two  Dragons  lock eyes, and "Ancient" stops its attack, much to the shock of Goodwin and  Jack . "Ancient", " Power Tool Mecha Dragon " and " Blackwing Dragon Black Feather " all roar, and the eyes of the  Ultimate God  on their chests all shatter. Goodwin protests that it can't be; the Duel Dragons broke the spell of " Ultimaya Tzolkin " by themselves. Jack wonders what is going on, and Akiza tells him that she's sure that Jack feels it too; the howl of the Duel Dragons' souls. She holds her hand over her heart and closes her eyes, and Jack asks if she means " Red Dragon ". He snaps the vine binding his arm, and adopts the same pose as Akiza. Deep in the  Graveyard , " Moonlight Dragon Black Rose " and "Red Dragon" both roar, and the eyes of the Ultimate God shatter on their chests. Goodwin snaps that it's impossible; he didn't grant the Duel Dragons freedom. Sect retorts that it's totally possible; the power of the Turbo Duelists turned into prayer and woke the Duel Dragons' souls. As Goodwin asks "prayers?!", Sect places his hand over his heart and thinks that he'll lend Yusei his strength too.
 As  Aerial Fortress Seibal  continues to crash to the ground,  Lazar  wonders what on earth everyone is doing.  Leo ,  Luna ,  Crow ,  Kalin ,  Jean ,  Tanner ,  Tetsu ,  Greiger ,  Ramon Kagura , and  Adolf Mueller  are all praying as Akiza, Jack, and Sect are. Yusei can feel the prayers of each and every Turbo Duelist, and a vision begins to appear in his mind. He sees "Ultimaya Tzolkin" facing the other five Duel Dragon, commanded by  five   figures  in ancient garb. A long-haired man who resmbles Jack notes that it was power-hungry human egos that made the God so enormous, and a man resembling Crow with his hair down agrees that the Ultimate God's power grows during the ritual to draw out its power. Another woman resembling Akiza states that wanting strength to protect your loved ones is inevitable, and she notes that human nature isn't evil. A man resembling an older Leo reminds them that now is not the times for that, and a woman with her hair down resembling an older Luna agrees that they have to seal it quickly. A voice calls that that's right - the Duel Priest who challenged Yusei for ownership of "Stardust", and he declares that he'll use "Stardust" to combine their power and seal the Ultimate God into Seibal. He raises his head, revealing his resemblance to Yusei as he declares that that is their mission as the Duel Priests and Prietesses of Light.
 Yusei recognizes the Priest as the vision ends, and he wonders who the memory belonged to. "Stardust" growls, and Yusei realizes that the memory belong to "Stardust". He yells that he gets it, and he activates his  Set  card, " Harmonic Geoglyph ". Goodwin is initially, surprised, but then he sarcastically praises Yusei for using a  Trap Card  that he can't activate since he only control "Stardust" and has no  Tuner monster  to use with the effect of "Harmonic Geoglyph". But Yusei replies that he remembered; no, their prayers reminded him of "Stardust's" true form from 10000 years ago. Goodwin claims that Yusei isn't making any sense, but Yusei orders "Stardust Spark Dragon" to awaken. "Stardust" begins shining as Jack, Sect and Akiza gape in shock, and Yusei continues with the effect of "Harmonic Geoglyph", selecting "Ancient Pixie Dragon", "Power Tool Mecha Dragon", and "Blackwing Dragon Black Feather" from Goodwin's field, in addition to the "Moonlight Dragon Black Rose" and "Hot Red Dragon Archfiend" in Goodwin's Graveyard, making them  Level 2 , and then  tuning  them with "Stardust Spark Dragon", which is also changed to Level 2. Goodwin realizes in shock that "Stardust" is really a Tuner monster, and Yusei confirms that "Stardust" has the power to unit everyone's hopes. He  chants , "Stars that grace the heavens of antiquity! Become sacred ruin and purify the world!  Synchro Summon ! The supreme advent!  Level 12 !  Divine Spark Dragon Stardust Sifr !"
 The Ultimate God roars at the  new   Synchro Monster , and Goodwin protests that it can't be; the God is  upset . He sees the Priests and Priestesses of Light standing alongside Yusei, and he wonders what they were. Jack looks up at "Stardust Sifr" and he calls it the crystallization of all Turbo Duelists' souls. He notes that Yusei Fudo was able to Summon the personification of bonds, and he looks at his hand, recalling that he's always denied friends and bonds as shackles, but Yusei converted them into power, and broke through all sorts of difficulties. Before Jack knew it, he'd also lent his power to it. He smiles, and he admits that he'll have to acknowledge Yusei. 
 Yusei declares his turn, and he warns Goodwin that he's coming. He Sets a card and attacks "Ultimaya Tzolkin" with the 4000 ATK "Stardust Sifr's" "Shooting Nova Blast". Akiza cheers that the attack will get through since Goodwin controls no Duel Dragons, and Sect agrees that Goodwin will take 4000 damage even if the Ultimate God blocks its destruction, and Yusei will win.

 Duel continues from  the previous Ride . 
 Turn 5: Rex 
 Rex  has just  declared  an  attack  with " Ancient Pixie Dragon " against " Stardust Spark Dragon ". However, the  Duel Dragons  are released from the  Ultimate God 's curse, so "Ancient" stops her attack. At this point, "Stardust" is revealed to be a  Tuner Synchro Monster .  Yusei   activates  his  face-down  " Harmonic Geoglyph ", tuning "Stardust" with "Ancient Pixie Dragon", " Power Tool Mecha Dragon ", " Blackfeather Darkrage Dragon ", " Jeweled Red Dragon Archfiend " and " Moonlight Dragon Black Rose ", treating all of them as  Level  2  monsters , and  Synchro Summoning  " Divine Spark Dragon Stardust Sifr " (4000/4000).

 Trivia 
 According to the omake for this chapter, after agreeing not to evolve " Stardust Spark Dragon " with another  Tuner monster , the writing staff for the manga decided to just use the six Duel Dragons.  Masashi Satō , the artist of the manga, originally wanted the  Tuner Synchro Monster  to be " Moonlight Dragon Black Rose ", but  Masahiro Hikokubo  and  Akira Ito  believed that it would extend the chapter count to high and take the story off track, and suggested "Stardust" to increase its importance.
