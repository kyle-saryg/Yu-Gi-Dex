 Max  is  Greiger 's brother. He is part of a tribe that descended from those who served the People of the Stars. It is implied that he and his sister  Annie  live in poverty, since Greiger is working to get aid for their hometown.
 Though it was originally thought that  Rex Goodwin  had sacrificed his hometown in an experiment to summon the  Crimson Dragon , in actuality, the souls of the villagers were swallowed by " Earthbound Immortal Chacu Challhua ". Max was freed with the destruction of "Chacu Challhua".
 When  Yusei  and  Jack  visited the Nazca region, he showed his Deck to Jack, who noticed that he is using a Power Deck, which has some cards that Jack also has in his Deck. Later they had a Turbo Duel, in which Jack was struck by power of his " Red Dragon Archfiend ", because Max was being possessed by the  Familiar , who used a power reversal strategy.
 
 Deck 
 In reality, Max has only one Deck that is similar to Jack's Ground Deck, including many of Jack's cards. When possessed by the  Servant  of the "Crimson Devil," his true Deck converted over to a different one which focuses on anti-power through  Special Summoning  and altering statistics.
