 History 
 Long ago, Alexander conquered many parts of the world with his large and powerful army. Eventually, he conquered Egypt and gained the  Millennium Ring , learning of the power that could rule the world. However, it was locked away by  Shadi , who feared that it would be used only by evil. After passing a series of tests, he gained the key to unlock this power, losing his vassals in the process.  However, the key crumbled in his hands, and his  dark half  (created thanks to the Millennium Ring) was split apart from his good half, and he was trapped within the Pyramid and his good side being flung into the Capsule Monster world. Some time later, the descendant of Alexander's good side came along;  Dr. Alex Brisbane , and was possessed by  Yami Alexander , who then lured  Yugi Muto  and his friends to the Capsule Monster game.
 
 Capsule Monsters 
 Alexander the Great gathered only three monsters during his time in the Capsule World. However, they were three powerful monsters. The first was  Seven-Armed Fiend , a strong monster which possessed a variety of dangerous abilities. It also had the power to summon several copies of  Skull Knight 2 . 
 The god monster  Reshef the Dark Being  was Alexander's most powerful capsule monster, and a symbol of his power. Reshef noticeably possessed a throne upon its head for Alexander to sit on during combat.
 The good Alexander gave his third monster,  Curse of Dragon , to  Solomon Mutou , to replace his destroyed  Summoned Skull .
 When Yugi and co. defeated his dark half, he was able to happily pass on.
