 A  direct attack  (Japanese:  直 接 攻 撃   chokusetsu kōgeki ) is the process where a  monster 's current  ATK  value is subtracted from the opponent's  Life Points , either when there are no monsters on your opponent's side of the  field , or if the  attacking  monster has the ability to attack directly (either by its own  effect  or the effect of another card).  Battle damage  inflicted this way was formerly referred to as "Direct Damage", but now the term "Direct Damage" refers to  Effect Damage  instead.
 Many monsters have the ability to perform a direct attack, even when there is a monster on the opponent's side of the field. However, to balance this, they typically have very low  ATK  values and/or a hindering effect (such as " Crystal Beast Amethyst Cat "). One major exception to this "rule" is " Earthbound Immortal " monsters, which have high ATK, but destroy themselves when there is no face-up  Field Spell Card  on the field. 
 Inflicting battle damage through direct attacks is a primary win condition for most Decks.
