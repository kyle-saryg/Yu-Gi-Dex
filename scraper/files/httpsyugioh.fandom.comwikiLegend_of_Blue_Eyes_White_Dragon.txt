 Legend of Blue Eyes White Dragon  is the first set of the  Yu-Gi-Oh! Trading Card Game . It was first released on March 8,  2002 [1] [2] [3]  in North America and Europe in English, French, German, Italian, and Spanish; on August 8, 2002 [4]  in Japan in Asian-English; on July 26,  2003 [5]  in Canada in French; and on December 9, 2003 [6]  in South Korea in Korean.
 The set has been released in the  Yu-Gi-Oh! Trading Card Game  in  English  in  North America ,  Europe ,  Oceania , and worldwide; in  French  in Europe and  Canada ; and in  German ,  Italian ,  Portuguese , and  Spanish ; in the  Yu-Gi-Oh! Official Card Game  it was released in  Asian-English  and  Korean .
 With many cards from the manga and anime series, the 126 cards in this English set were chosen from the Japanese packs  Legend of Blue Eyes White Dragon  and  Phantom God , the former of which this set is named after. After being discontinued by  Upper Deck Entertainment , these packs were prized for the rare " Blue-Eyes White Dragon " and the " Forbidden One " cards.
 Several of the European versions of  Legend of Blue Eyes White Dragon  (European English, European French, German, and Italian) only contained 103 of the 126 cards present in the North American version. Many of the cards not printed in this European release of this set were later printed in the European release of  Magic Ruler  (for those languages). Later, Upper Deck removed the regional restriction on cards, opening up the North American card market to European collectors and players.
 In 2004, a worldwide English version of the set (LOB-ENXXX) was printed in the  Master Collection Volume 1 . In all regions, this printing included the cards from the original North American release. This print made  errata  on many cards, including changing the term  Magic Card  to  Spell Card  and changing the name of "Trial of Hell" to " Trial of Nightmare ".
 In 2010, an  Unlimited Edition  North American version of the set (LOB-XXX) and an Unlimited Edition European version of the set (LOB-EXXX) was reprinted again and released with the  Legendary Collection . This print run ignored the  Master Collection Volume 1  errata and used the original North American text from  Legend of Blue Eyes White Dragon , but still changed Magic Card to Spell Card and changed the name of "Trial of Hell" to "Trial of Nightmare".
 The set was re-released in South Korea in Korean on March 15,  2011 . [note 1]  A coupon was included on the front flap of the box lid which could be exchanged for the  Legend of Blue Eyes White Dragon  promotional cards .
