 Spell Speed 2  (Japanese: スペルスピード２) card effects are effects that can be used when you  have priority.  Typically, you use these in response to  Spell Speed 1  and other Spell Speed 2 effects, however some can start a Chain themselves as well. Spell Speed 2 card and effects cannot be activated in response to  Spell Speed 3  effects. Spell Speed 2 effects are also called " Fast Effects ".
 If a card states, "during either player's turn", then it is considered Spell Speed 2. It may also say "(this is a Quick Effect)". Starting from  Starter Deck: Link Strike , Quick effects on monsters are written as [Condition] (Quick Effect): [Cost; Effect]
 Continuous Trap Cards  are considered to have Spell Speed 2 effects, even if they may omit "during either player's turn". An example of this is the effect of  Dark Smog .
 The following are all Spell Speed 2:
