 Summary 
 Téa  climbs up the destroyed bridge to the other side of the canyon and, exhausted, falls asleep. She is woken by a penguin. It leads her to a raft, which takes her to a beach filled with more penguins.
 The penguins lead her to a building where  Crump , in the form of " Nightmare Penguin ", introduces himself and challenges her to a Duel. 
 Téa runs away but becomes trapped in an icy arena where Crump forces her to Duel him. She chooses " Dark Magician Girl " as her  Deck Master . 
 When a player loses  Life Points , ice forms around that player from the feet up.
 As a penguin, Crump is immune to cold, so even though both players are subject to the freezing rule, Téa is the only one suffering as it happens. 
 Dark Magician Girl gives Téa advice and encouragement at key points in the Duel. 
 Crump tells Téa about his childhood and how he developed a love for numbers and penguins, who jointly care for their young, after his parents neglected him. 
 After entering a virtual door in the previous episode,  Yugi  finds himself in a dark maze with a series of doors. Behind the doors are monsters which he must destroy with his own cards to progress. During this, he can hear Téa's agonizing cries from being frozen.       As their life points diminish,  Téa and Crump’s bodies become covered in ice.     
 Featured Duels 
 Téa Gardner vs Crump 
 Téa 's  Deck Master  is " Dark Magician Girl ".  Crump 's Deck Master is " Nightmare Penguin ".
 Turn 1: Téa 
Téa  draws  " Mirror Force " and subsequently  Sets  it. She then  Normal Summons  " Ancient Elf " (1450/1200) in  Attack Position .
 Turn 2: Crump 
 Crump  draws " Giant Red Seasnake " and subsequently Normal Summons it (1800/800) in Attack Position. His  Deck Master ability  increases the  ATK  of  WATER   monsters  by 200 (1800 → 2000). Crump  activates  " Cold Wave ", preventing both players from  activating  any  Magic  or  Trap Cards  until Crump's next  turn . "Giant Red Seasnake"  attacks  and  destroys  "Ancient Elf" (Téa 4000 → 3450).
 Turn 3: Téa 
Téa draws a monster and subsequently  Sets  it.
 Turn 4: Crump 
Crump draws " Gust ". He then Sets two cards.
 Turn 5: Téa 
Téa draws " Mystical Space Typhoon " and subsequently activates it to destroy Crump's Set "Gust". As one or more of his Trap Cards was destroyed by a card effect his opponent  controls , Crump activates his  face-down  " Driving Snow " to destroy Téa's set "Mirror Force". Téa's  hand  contains " Skelengel ", " Offerings to the Doomed ", " Pot of Greed ", and " Petit Angel ". Téa activates "Offerings to the Doomed" to destroy "Giant Red Seasnake" but preventing herself from conducting her  Draw Phase  next turn. 
 Téa  Flip Summons  " Fire Sorcerer " (1000/1500). The  Flip Effect  of "Fire Sorcerer" activates, letting Téa  remove  two cards in her  hand  from play [Notes 1]  and inflict 800  damage  to Crump (Crump 4000 → 3200). "Fire Sorcerer" attacks  directly  (Crump 3200 → 2200).
 Turn 6: Crump 
Crump Normal Summons " Flying Penguin " (1200 → 1400/1000) in Attack Position. Crump then activates " Penguin Sword ",  equipping  it to "Flying Penguin" and increasing its ATK by 800 ("Flying Penguin": 1400 → 2200/1000). "Flying Penguin" attacks and destroys "Fire Sorcerer" (Téa 3450 → 2250).
 Duel continues in  the next episode . 
 
 Doorway Puzzle 
 Level 1  -  Yugi  Summons " Winged Dragon, Guardian of the Fortress " (1400/1200) and  attacks . The monster hidden in the the door is revealed to be " Sinister Serpent " (300/250), which is  destroyed .
 Duel continues in  the next episode . 
 
 Differences in adaptations 
 Certain shots of " Dark Magician Girl " flying across the stage and of  Anzu  sitting in the audience are cut from the dub. 
 "Dark Magician Girl" is given more clothing to wear in the dub. 
 As during Yugi's Duel with Gansley, a shot of the Crump's face is added to the dub, overlaid with his  Deck Master 's. 
 When  Téa  selects her cards for her Deck, " Sage's Stone " is changed to " Mirror Force " in the  dub . 
 In the Japanese version, Crump chooses Téa for his opponent; in the dub,  Noah  chooses Crump's opponent for him. 
 In the Japanese version, Crump gives Téa an audition for the "Dark Magician Girl" play; in the dub, he goes over facts about her and her daily life to prove how well he researches. 
 In the Japanese version, Crump says because of Téa's father's job, she moved around a lot; this is skipped in the dub. 
 " Giant Red Seasnake " biting " Ancient Elf " is obscured in the dub. 
 The card that Tea destroys is replaced by " Mirror Wall " in the dub. 
 In the Japanese version, the penguin and Téa are shown going through a jungle and past a snake. This is removed in the dub. 
 In the Japanese version, Crump stated that his parents were often quarreling with each other and didn't care about him. In the dub, he states they never had time for him as they were always working late. As such, the shot of Crump as a child was altered to remove the silhouettes of his parents arguing. 
 Errors 
 In the dub, when  Téa 's " Mirror Force " is  destroyed  by " Driving Snow ," we see enough of her face-down  Monster Card  to confirm that it was " The Unhappy Maiden ." When she Summons it, it is " Fire Sorcerer ."
