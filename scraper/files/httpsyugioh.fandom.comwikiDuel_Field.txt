Not to be confused with  field . 
       From left to right: the magma, space, jungle, and desert fields.     
 A  Duel Field  is a special field exclusively used in the  World Duel Carnival  finals. There are four of these fields: magma, space, jungle, and desert. Each of them exists in the underground section of the  Duel Coaster . [1] 
 Relating to their names, each field occurs at a certain location; specifically, they occur at a volcano, a spacecraft, a jungle and a canyon. These stages are where the eight WDC finalists engage in one-on-one Duels in order to progress to the second-last round of the tournament.
 In addition to this, each Duel Field is also its own Field Spell Card, having an effect that will influence the Duel. For example, the " Jungle Field " inflicts 1000 points of  damage  to a player who does not Summon a  monster  from their  hand  during their  turn . The " Sphere Field " is counted as Duel Field, and is used in the World Duel Carnival finals match between  Yuma Tsukumo  and  Vetrix  on top of the  Duel Tower .
 
 Finalists 
 Jungle  -  Vetrix  VS  Dextra 
 Space  -  Quinton  VS  Kite Tenjo 
 Magma  -  Quattro  VS  Reginald Kastle 
 Desert  -  Nistro  VS  Yuma Tsukumo 
 Trivia 
 Duel Fields can be compared to the " Speed World " from  Yu-Gi-Oh! 5D's  and  Action Fields  from  Yu-Gi-Oh! ARC-V . They are all  Field Spell Cards  activated just before the  Duel , but are not actually in any player's  Deck .
