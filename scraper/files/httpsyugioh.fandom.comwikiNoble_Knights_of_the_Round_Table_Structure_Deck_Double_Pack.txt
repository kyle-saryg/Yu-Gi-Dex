 Noble Knights of the Round Table Structure Deck: Double Pack  is an original product in the video game  Yu-Gi-Oh! Duel Arena . It was only available after the "urgent maintenance" on November 21, 2014 until after maintenance on December 17, 2014.
 Each product costs 39,000 Miniclip Credits.
 This product is composed of the contents of  Noble Knights of the Round Table Box Set  and  Noble Knights of the Round Table Power-Up Pack , with " Token Thanksgiving " included to celebrate the upcoming  Thanksgiving  after its release. Its purpose is to prevent players from receiving 4 or more copies of the same card, like they would have if they bought 2 copies of the  original Structure Deck  in-game. To make up the difference and ensure players would receive the same amount of cards as they would have with 2 copies of the Structure Deck, bonus cards are included that complement the Deck's strategy. As such, there are no more than 3 copies of any individual card in this product.
