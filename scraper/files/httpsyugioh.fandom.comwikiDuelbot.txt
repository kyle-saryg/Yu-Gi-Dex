A  Duelbot , known as a  Riding Roid  in the Japanese version, is a type of robot used by  Sector Security  in order to assist them with crimes involving  Duel Runners . It is later used by the  Three Pure Nobles  as part of their secretive plans.
 Trudge  named this type of robot a Duelbot and revealed that these special robots are being used by  Sector Security . In actuality, they are being mass produced by  Primo , as a part of his plans to speed the activation of the  Grand Design  by Dueling with full force.
 
         Duelbot in Primo's factory.     
 The first Duelbot seen is  Ghost , which was used to terrorize and defeat Turbo Duelists, causing them to crash with major injuries. Its identity was revealed after  Yusei Fudo  defeated it in a  Turbo Duel . After the defeat, Ghost rode out of the Dueling lane and crashed into some trees. After Yusei, Jack Atlas, and  Crow  arrived, Crow touched the robot's metal arm, which fell off.
 This robot not only has been disguised to look like a human being, but it also possesses the characteristics and qualities of a  Turbo Duelist . Its Deck was actually Primo's Deck as part of his plan to test it out on other Duelists. After Ghost was beaten, Primo took back his Deck and even destroyed the memory chip inside Ghost to remove any evidence Sector Security might find.
 Before it blew up, there was a factory that was mass producing robots similar to  Ghost , it seems that they all were able to escape and wreck havoc, as part of  Primo 's plans.
 One of these robots  was even disguised and impersonating  Jack Atlas  himself, causing the same chaos on the Duel highway as  Ghost  had previously. This imposter was able to defeat the original at first, but later lost during their rematch after Jack chose to use " Trust Guardian " as opposed to not doing so in the first Duel. At the end of that  Duel , the overwhelming attack of Jack's " Majestic Red Dragon " destroyed the robot. The robot's Duel Runner was destroyed in the explosion caused by the attack and its Deck (created by  Lester ) was automatically disintegrated into nothingness.
 After the Duel between  Team 5D's  against  Team Catastrophe , Primo unleashes his army of this bots whom he dubs " Diablo ". These robots then face off against  Turbo Duelists  through  Battle Royal  Duels. All of these robots use " Ally of Justice " monsters during their Duels. Nearly all of them were destroyed thanks to the efforts of Yusei, Jack, Crow, Kaz, Vizor, Sherry, and Elsworth.
