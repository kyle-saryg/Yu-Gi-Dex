 Biography 
       Dark Spirit of Chaos being extracted from the criminal     
 Negative emotions created the Dark Spirit of Chaos monster ka in the man's soul. This drove him to commit crimes, strengthening the ka. The criminal attempted to steal from Pharaoh  Aknamkanon 's tomb, but found no treasure, [1]  as it had already been raided by  Thief King Bakura . [2] 
 The criminal was captured and brought before  Pharaoh Atem . He pleaded innocent, as he had not stolen anything, but was told by the guards that he would still face the judgment of the Gods, for stepping on sacred grounds.  Shada  used the  Millennium Key  to look into the man's heart, where he saw the shadow of an evil ka.  Akhenaden  then used the  Millennium Eye  to expose the Dark Spirit of Chaos, after which  Seto  completed the exorcism by using the  Millennium Rod  to seal it within a stone tablet. [1]  Seto suggested that the criminal be executed for the amusement of the Pharaoh and to set a warning for future thieves. Akhenaden argued that it was unnecessary, as the evil ka had been removed and that it was the duty of a priest to show mercy. Akhenaden then had the man sentenced to seven years hard labor. [2] 
 When Atem entered his  Memory World , the judging of this criminal was the first event that he rewitnessed. [1]
