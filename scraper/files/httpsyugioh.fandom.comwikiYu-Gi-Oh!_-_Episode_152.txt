 Mai's Motives 
 Mai  and  Joey  are in a Duel, but he is not fighting back because the "Seal of Orichalcos" is already in play, and defeating Mai would mean the loss of her "soul". 
 Mai recalls having fought in Duel Monsters tournaments and won, but the victories were not really meaningful. When she was alone, she still remembered the fear from  her Punishment Game , and she knew there was still the chance of such a loss. 
 In such anxiety, she met  Valon , who offered a way for her to find power which would mean she could never be defeated. He introduces her to  Dartz  (this is the first time he announces his own name), who convinces her that her only solution is to keep on winning. He grants her the power of the Orichalcos. 
 Valon is watching Mai duel Joey now, as is  Rafael , though Valon is far more interested in Mai's progress. 
 Meanwhile 
 Duke, Weevil and Rex find the destroyed gasoline stand from the previous episode. Duke quickly assumes something bad happened, given the remains of one bike and decides to rush towards the I2 building.
 Kaiba's jet is also heading towards there at the same time. Mokuba is trying to contact I2, but is unable to. Kaiba expected it: the reason  Alister  lured him out to  Duelist Kingdom  was so that his 'accomplices' could deal with the real Pegasus. 
 Indecision 
 Yami Yugi is disposed to try to break the "Seal" with the  Millennium Puzzle , but Valon reminds him that's in vain. Rafael claims that he will fight him next, to which Mai interjects and claims her own targets. Rafael scolds her for wanting to rebel against orders, but Valon doesn't mind. Rafael also spots Yami Yugi examining the " The Eye of Timaeus " and thinks that, no matter what power it has, it cannot interfere. 
 Joey becomes resigned to the fact that Mai is not to be shaken from her Duel, and he Duels back, but only playing defensively. Mai rips through such tactics, taking an early lead.
 Joey resorts to " Scapegoat ", a favorite stall tactic of his, but Mai has a counter-strategy ready which floods the Field with Harpies. 
 Even when he makes an effort to decrease the army of opponents, she parries it easily, and on her next turn, she plays her latest trump Card to wipe out all his Monsters and nearly all his Life Points. 
 There is no more denying that Mai is determined to fight him. It is at this point that Joey realizes Mai is not to won back with timidity. He is still vowed to help her, but his Dueling spirit will have to keep back her rage. With a fresh heart, he Draws his new Card, beginning their Duel in earnest.
