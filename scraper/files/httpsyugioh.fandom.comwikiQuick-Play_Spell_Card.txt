 Mechanics 
 Players may activate Quick-Play Spell Cards from their  hand  at anytime during their own turn (except the  Damage Step , unless ruled otherwise), but cannot activate them from their hand during the opponent's turn [1] 
 Face-down  Quick-Play Spell Cards can be activated during either player's turn, but they cannot be activated the turn they are  Set , very much like  Trap Card . [1]  i.e. If a player Sets a Quick-Play Spell Card during their own turn, they cannot activate it until the beginning of their opponent's next turn.
 Quick-Play Spell Cards are  Spell Speed  2, and can be  Chained  to other cards.
 
 Example 
 Assuming Player A is the  turn player .
 
 Usage during the player's turn 
 Player A activates " Dark Hole ". 
 Player B chains " Imperial Order ". 
 Player A chains " Mystical Space Typhoon " from their  hand . [2] 
 Usage during the opponent's turn 
 Player A activates " Level Limit - Area B " 
 Player B chains " Twister " after he set it the previous turn.
