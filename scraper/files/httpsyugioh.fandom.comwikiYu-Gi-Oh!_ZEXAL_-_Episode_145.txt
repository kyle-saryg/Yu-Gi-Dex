 Summary 
       Yuma  admits he's enjoying facing his own ace card.     
 Yuma  recalls what is at stake in this  Duel . If  Astral  wins, he'll annihilate the  Barian World . Yuma had vowed not to let him do that, wagering the  Numeron Code  on one more Duel. Astral has told him that if he wins he'll also erase all memories Yuma had of Astral in addition to destroying the Barian World. In the present, Astral asks if Yuma has already lost the will to fight. He muses it was a hundred years too early to challenge him to a Duel (in the dub, Astral chides Yuma for his reckless decision to challenge Astral to a Duel). He  activates  " Xyz Treasure ", letting him  draw a card  for each  Xyz Monster  on the  field . There are five, so he draws five cards,  Sets  three and ends his turn.  Trey  remarks that with five forms of "Utopia" on the field and Astral armed with all the " Numbers ", Yuma is still surviving.  Quattro  agrees, saying he's still doing pretty well.  Quinton  tells them that Astral is playing seriously, as the Numeron Code is on the line (in the dub, Quattro compares Astral's Dueling strategy to a lion playing with its appetizer, while Quinton notes that despite Yuma's growth as a Duelist, he's still outclassed and outmatched by Astral).  Dextra  says she expected this of Astral, while  Nistro  is surprised at such overwhelming power (in the dub, Dextra is surprised that Yuma has given up, while Nistro remarks that this is no surprise because Yuma's best friend is overwhelming him).  Caswell  remarks that it's a lop-sided Duel (in the dub, Flip speaks at this point, commenting that this Duel is anything but friendly) and  Anna  believes Astral has gone overboard. 
 
       The group reacts to Yuma's declaration.       Bronk  tells them that though this is their first Duel, it will be their last and they've been waiting ages for it (in the dub, Bronk says Astral is Dueling Yuma as if he was his worst enemy).  Cathy  closes her eyes and says she can't watch anymore, while  Tori  recalls Yuma telling her what Astral will do if he wins and mutters Yuma's name. Astral tells him it's his turn now, but wonders if he's already broken his heart and soul to pieces (in the dub, Astral tells Yuma it's pointless to continue, especially with his limited intellect). Yuma starts laughing hysterically and gets to his feet. He remarks how cool "Utopia" and its other forms are. Astral seems confused, but Yuma explains that until now, he's only ever seen "Utopia" from the back, as he was the one using it. Now he gets a front-row set to see five forms side-by-side. He admits it's way cooler than he'd though it would be. He muses that it's annoying not to be the one using them, but adds that they fit Astral like a glove. Calming himself, he tells Astral he won't pull any punches now. Quattro says he's getting fired up now and Trey remarks he hasn't given up yet. Quinton adds that that's just like him. Nistro remarks in the same fashion and Dextra tells him that Yuma's not changed a bit. Anna wonders if he can really fight against this, with  Nelson  saying this is ridiculous. Bronk reminds them that "Numbers" can't be  destroyed  by anything other than another "Number". Cathy wonders what he could do against that. Tori seems to realize what Yuma is planning and urges him on.
       " Gagaga Magician " and " Gagaga Mancer ".     
 Yuma draws, while Astral mentally urges him to get fired up - otherwise, he'll be unable to get back what he lost. Yuma activates "Xyz Treasure", drawing five cards. He  Normal Summons  " Gagaga Mancer ", revealing that once per turn, this monster can  Special Summon  a " Gagaga "  monster  from his  Graveyard . "Mancer" throws its staff into the ground, where it glows before vanishing as " Gagaga Magician " rises from the Graveyard portal. Astral remarks he has two  Level  4 monsters and wonders what he's planning. Yuma tells him not to get ahead of himself and activates his  face-down  " Gagagamirage ". This will let him treat a "Gagaga" monster on the field as two monsters for an  Xyz Summon , while also letting him ignore  Attribute  and  Type  conditions for an Xyz Summon once per turn. Yuma  overlays  "Gagaga Mancer" to Xyz Summon " Gagaga Cowboy ", then does the same with "Gagaga Magician" to Xyz Summon " Gagaga Samurai ". Yuma activates the  effect  of "Gagaga Samurai",  detaching  an  Overlay Unit  to let "Gagaga" monsters  attack  twice this turn. "Samurai" slices its Overlay Unit and blue light covers both monsters. 
 
         " Gagaga Cowboy " fires.     
 Yuma then activates the effect of "Gagaga Cowboy", detaching an Overlay Unit to increase its  ATK  by 1000 and reduce the ATK of the monster it  battles  by 500. Astral reminds him that the effect of " Number 39: Utopia Beyond " protects his monsters from being affected by card effects, so "Cowboy" cannot destroy any of Astral's monsters. Yuma says he's wrong, prompting Astral to yell "what!?" ("Partner?!" in the dub) Yuma activates the effect of the "Gagaga Mancer" in his Graveyard,  banishing  it to increase the ATK of a "Gagaga" monster he  controls  by 500. The ATK of "Cowboy" rises to 3000 total. Cathy excitedly yells that its ATK rose again and Yuma orders "Cowboy" to attack " Chaos Number 39: Utopia Ray ". "Utopia Ray" explodes in a hail of bullets, reducing Astral to 4750. Anna says a "Number" was destroyed by a non-"Number". Yuma orders "Cowboy" to attack again and " Chaos Number 39: Utopia Ray V " is riddled with bullets and Astral's Life Points fall to 4350. Trey is shocked Yuma managed to destroy two forms of "Utopia". Quinton remarks that Yuma is keeping his cool and that since "Utopia Ray" and "Utopia Ray V" were Summoned via  Quick-Play Spell Cards  that  negated  their effects, a non-"Number" was able to destroy them. Quattro seems quite impressed by Yuma's play. 
 Astral says he'll give Yuma credit for his move, but points out that "Cowboy" can no longer attack, so they've reached a deadlock. Yuma claims only Astral is deadlocked. He activates the Quick-Play Spell Card, " Gagaga Mirror Slash ". This lets him  target  a "Gagaga" monster and change its name and  ATK to the same as the monster it battles, while preventing it from being destroyed by battle and inflicting  damage  to the opponent equal to the ATK of any monsters it destroyed. Astral yells "What!", while Yuma specifies he's targeting "Samurai". Yuma orders "Samurai" to attack "Utopia Beyond". "Samurai" reverts to an energy form and streams towards its target, its energy form shifting into that of "Utopia Beyond" and its ATK rising to 3000. Yuma declares " Rising Sun Beyond Slash " and "Utopia Beyond" explodes. Yuma reminds Astral that "Gagaga Mirror Slash" will inflict damage to Astral equal to the destroyed monster's ATK now. Astral is thrown onto his back, his Life Points at 1350. 
 
         " Gagaga Samurai " takes the form of " Number C39: Utopia Ray Victory ".     
 Yuma orders his next attack and "Samurai" takes the form of "Utopia Ray Victory", its ATK becoming 2800. Bronk,  Flip   and Tori remark that if the attack goes through, Astral will lose. Astral activates his face-down " Heat & Heal ", which lets him gain  Life Points  equal to the ATK of the "Number" with the lowest  Rank  on the field. That monster is "Utopia", so he gains 2500 Life Points, bringing him back to 3850. Yuma declares " Rising Sun Double Victory Slash " and "Victory" explodes. 
 
         The Duel begins taking its toll on  Astral .     
 Astral screams as his Life Points fall to 1050. As he hits the ground, Astral begins to fade in and out. Yuma yells his name, but Astral reveals that "Heat & Heal" then  attachs  to "Utopia" as a Overlay Unit. Yuma asks if he's alright. Astral admits he was a bit careless, and muses that when Yuma was looking at the five forms, he should have noticed - Yuma wasn't just staring at them talking about how cool they were. Yuma says he caught him, then. Astral remarks that Yuma was putting on a act, being surprised at Astral bringing out all the forms of "Utopia". Yuma tells him he did the brainstorming of his life to build his Deck for this Duel. He did so while remembering all the times they fought together and says it's thanks to Astral he's become as strong as he is. 
 Yuma goes on to tell Astral that it was him to that gave him the confidence to overcome everything - that and " kattobingu ". He believes he and Astral are like one mind and body now - if Yuma can believe in others, Astral should be able to as well. Yuma vows to make Astral believe in others again, so they can create a better tomorrow. There is no way he'll give up. Yuma says that even if Astral is the strongest Duelist in the universe, Yuma will gamble on the 1 in 10,000 chance he has to win. Astral tells Yuma to come at him and says he's fighting with everything he has, as a denizen of the  Astral World  (in the dub, Astral tells Yuma there's nothing he can do to change his mind because he will not let Yuma win, and he must defend the Astral World). Quattro remarks that they're at odds with one another. Trey seems surprised (in the dub, Quattro and Trey are confused by Astral's words, but the latter is suspicious about something), but Quinton seems to see something else. He realizes that Astral's mission is to erase the Barian World with the Numeron Code - he must be refusing to budge on that matter. Trey says Yuma would never let that happen. Quinton tells him that's why Yuma is Dueling then. Trey wonders why Astral would do this though - he knows Yuma best. Quinton agrees, believing there is something  off  about this Duel (this final exchange is cut from the dub). 
 Yuma Sets three cards and the ATK of "Cowboy" returns to 1500. Astral draws and Yuma tells him to bring it on. Astral orders "Utopia" to attack "Cowboy", but Yuma activates his face-down " Half Unbreak ", halving the  battle damage  and preventing the destruction of "Cowboy" by battle. Astral says he'll activate a  Trap  as well then - " Absolute Buster ". This card negates any effects that would protect a monster from being destroyed. Yuma says Astral read his move and "Absolute Buster" fires a beam which dissipates the bubble shield generated by "Half Unbreak". Astral declares " Rising Sun Slash " and "Utopia" destroys "Cowboy". Yuma's Life Points fall to 900 as he's blasted backwards.  Cathy closes her eyes and Tori yells Yuma's name. Astral tells Yuma that they both know everything about one another - and that is why he cannot give a single inch in this Duel. Astral Sets three cards to end his turn and tells Yuma to come at him (in the dub, Astral commends Yuma for improving his Dueling skills, but reminds him he is nowhere as good as he is; he also tells Yuma that he thought he knew his strategies, but he was wrong). Seeing Astral and "Utopia" before him, Yuma thinks to himself that meeting Astral was the first time he ever had an Xyz Monster - and that monster was "Utopia". Knowing he hasn't forgotten the feelings he had when he Xyz Summoned the first time, he vowed to continue fighting - "Utopia" truly was his hope (in the dub, Yuma also reminds himself that he has to fight against "Utopia" in order to defeat Astral). Yuma yells "kattobingu" and draws, with Astral mentally urging him on (Astral's inner monologue is cut from the dub). 
 
         Yuma's bluff is successful.     
 Yuma activates " Gagagarevenge ", letting him Special Summon a "Gagaga" monster from his Graveyard and  equip  "Gagagarevenge" to it. He revives "Gagaga Cowboy" and tells Astral he's coming with everything he has now. He orders "Cowboy" to attack "Utopia". Astral is incredulous. Anna says "Cowboy" has less ATK and Trey adds that "Cowboy" has no Overlay Units either (in the dub, Trey calls the attack nuts because the stress of the Duel must have gotten to Yuma's head). Seeing the ATK difference of 1000 and Yuma's Life Points at only 900, two Set cards and a card still in his hand, Astral realizes something must be going on with this attack. He activates the effect of "Utopia", detaching an Overlay Unit to negate the attack. He declares " Light Wing Shield " and the fist of "Cowboy" rebounds off the shield. Yuma says he took the bait. Astral mutters "what?" and Yuma activates his face-down " Light Wing Bumper ". When an attack is negated with a monster effect, that monster loses 800 ATK. The ATK of "Utopia" falls to 1700. Astral is shocked. He muses that Yuma knew he would negate the attack, then. Yuma says he figured he could get Astral to flinch at the last second that way. Yuma orders "Samurai" to attack "Utopia". Astral's Life Points fall to 850 as "Utopia" detonates. Yuma does several back flips, cheering.
 
         Astral prepares to  Rank-Down .     
 Astral compliments him, saying he wagered victory or defeat on a bluff. He thinks only Yuma could pull off a Duel like this. Bronk cheers that Yuma actually defeated all five forms of "Utopia". Cathy says he did a good job and Nistro is impressed as well. Dextra remarks that he even pulled this off with Astral as his opponent. Quattro says he had him nervous there for a second, with Trey telling him that's how Yuma is, though. Yuma tells Astral that Dueling against him is even more awesome than he could have imagined. But it would be better if the threat wasn't hanging over his head. Remembering Astral's vow to destroy the Barian World, Yuma is somber. He asks Astral if he forgot something though. When Yuma defeated  Eliphas , they agreed that the Astral World doesn't have to  Rank-Up  anymore. - that wasn't the future they aimed for, to throw people aside without considering their feelings. Yuma says he found a future where you don't need to Rank-Up and asks if Eliphas didn't entrust that very future to them. Yuma tells him that they can start over no matter what, so long as they understand each other (in the dub, Yuma's story is different: whenever he had to Duel, the fate of the galaxy was at stake; he lost  Shark ,  Kite , and some of his closest friends during the battle against the Barians. Yuma was going to quit Dueling until Astral's mission dragged him into having this Duel. He finishes by asking why he had to risk something whenever he had to Duel). Astral vows he'll never forgot Yuma's words or the times they spent together for even an instant (in the dub, Astral questions if this Duel was the only way to get Yuma to Duel again). Yuma mutters Astral's name, while Astral says he will fulfill the pact they signed together. Yuma asks what pact he means and Astral responds that there is an answer in every Duel (in the dub, Astral reminds Yuma that he solves problems through Dueling, and beckons him to find a solution through this Duel). Astral activates his face-down " Rank-Down-Magic Utopia Fall ", prompting Yuma to yell "RANK-DOWN-MAGIC?!" Astral reveals that when a "Number" he controls is destroyed, this card will let him Xyz Summon an Xyz Monster of a lower Rank and attach the destroyed monster to it as an Overlay Unit. He declares " Xyz Devolution! " and Xyz Summons " Number 39: Utopia Roots " in Attack Position. Yuma is shocked that Astral Ranked-Down and mutters "Utopia Roots..." (in the dub, Yuma realizes that Astral must have wanted "Utopia Roots" on the field). 
 
         " Gagaga Samurai " moves to defend.     
 Yuma Sets a card and ends his turn, with Astral telling him it's time to get back what he lost. Yuma asks what he means, but Astral's response is to start his turn. He activates " Number Fortification ", which he can  equip  to a " Utopic " monster to increase its ATK by 1500. Then he can attach two "Numbers" from his  Extra Deck  to it as Overlay Units. Its ATK rises to 2000 and Astral attaches " Number 32: Shark Drake " and " Number 62: Galaxy-Eyes Prime Photon Dragon " to it as Overlay Units. The two monsters appear to the right and left of "Roots" before becoming Overlay Units. Yuma asks why he attached Shark and Kite's cards as Overlay Units. Astral says he will never forget fighting alongside them - or alongside Yuma. He says that fate has placed hardships on Yuma's shoulders. Even with his heart, body and soul smashed to tatters, Yuma survived and the two of them won. Astral tells him he's unaware of the most important thing that has been stolen from him, though, but that Astral remembers. Astral orders "Utopia Roots" to attack "Gagaga Cowboy", but Yuma activates the effect of "Gagaga Samurai". When a "Gagaga" monster is attacked, he can redirect the attack target to "Samurai" and change it to Defense Position. "Samurai" vaults in front of "Cowboy" and crosses its swords as it switches positions.
 Astral activates his face-down " Rank Revolution ". If he controls only one Xyz Monster, this card will negate the effects of all Xyz Monsters with higher Ranks. Thus, "Samurai" is blown away from "Cowboy" and Astral declares " Rising Sun Roots Slash ", destroying "Cowboy" and reducing Yuma's Life Points to 400. Tori gasps, while Astral activates a  Continuous Trap Card  called " Overlay Accel ". When a Xyz Monster destroys a monster by battle, this card will let it detach an Overlay Unit to attack again. Yuma asks "wh..what?!" and Astral says "Utopia Roots" has three Overlay Units. Anna says that if this goes on, Yuma will lose here. Astral detaches "Shark Drake", prompting its spectral form to join in on the attack against "Samurai", who explodes. Astral yells that Yuma must take back what is most important to him - the thing that was stolen from him. As rubble flies and Yuma falls backwards, he wonders what that could be.
 
 Featured Duel: Yuma Tsukumo vs. Astral 
 Duel continues from  the previous episode . 
 Turn 2: Astral 
 Astral   activates  " Xyz Treasure " to draw five cards (one for each  Xyz Monster  on the  field ). Astral Sets 3 cards. On Astral's End Phase, the effect of " Chaos Number 39: Utopia Ray Victory " expires ("Utopia Ray Victory": 4600 → 2800 ATK).
 
         " Number 39: Utopia Beyond " protects  Astral 's  monsters .     
 Turn 3: Yuma 
 Yuma  draws. He then activates "Xyz Treasure" to draw five cards as there are still five Xyz Monsters on the field. He then  Normal Summons  " Gagaga Mancer " ( 4/100/100) in Attack Position. Yuma activates the first  effect  of "Gagaga Mancer" to revive " Gagaga Magician " ( 4/1500/1000) in  Attack Position  (as it's a " Gagaga " monster). Astral assumes Yuma will perform an  Xyz Summon  at this point, but Yuma activates his face-down " Gagagamirage ", allowing him to treat "Gagaga" monsters he  controls  as two  Overlay Units  for the  Xyz Summon  of an Xyz Monster, while also allowing Yuma to ignore any  Type  and  Attribute  requirements needed to Summon one of the monsters Xyz Summoned this way this  turn . Yuma overlays "Gagaga Mancer" with itself in order to Xyz Summon " Gagaga Cowboy " ( 4/1500/2400, ORU: 1) in Attack Position, ignoring its requirement of an  EARTH  monster. He then overlays "Gagaga Magician" with itself in order to Xyz Summon " Gagaga Samurai " ( 4/1900/1600, ORU: 1) in Attack Position. 
 Yuma activates the first  effect  of "Gagaga Samurai" to  detach  "Gagaga Magician" ("Gagaga Samurai": 1 → 0 ORU) and allow all "Gagaga" monsters to  attack  twice this turn. Yuma then activates the effect of "Gagaga Cowboy" to detach "Gagaga Mancer" ("Gagaga Cowboy": 1 → 0 ORU), increase its  ATK  by 1000 ("Gagaga Cowboy": 1500 → 2500 ATK), and decrease the ATK of one of Astral's monsters by 500. However, due to the second effect of " Number 39: Utopia Beyond ", Astral's cards are unaffected by Yuma's card effects. Yuma activates the second effect of "Gagaga Mancer" to  banish  it from his Graveyard and increase the ATK of "Gagaga Cowboy" (a "Gagaga" monster) by 500 during damage calculation.
 
         " Gagaga Samurai "  destroys  "Utopia Beyond".     
 "Gagaga Cowboy" attacks " Chaos Number 39: Utopia Ray " and the effect of "Gagaga Mancer" becomes active ("Gagaga Cowboy": 2500 → 3000 ATK). "Gagaga Cowboy" then destroys "Utopia Ray" (Astral: 5250 → 4750 LP). After damage calculation, the effect of "Gagaga Mancer" expires ("Gagaga Cowboy": 3000 → 2500 ATK). "Gagaga Cowboy" attacks " Chaos Number 39: Utopia Ray V " and the effect of "Gagaga Mancer" becomes active ("Gagaga Cowboy": 2500 → 3000 ATK). "Gagaga Cowboy" then destroys "Utopia Ray V" (Astral: 4750 → 4350 LP). After damage calculation, the effect of "Gagaga Mancer" expires ("Gagaga Cowboy": 3000 → 2500 ATK).
 Yuma activates " Gagaga Mirror Slash " to target "Gagaga Samurai" (a "Gagaga" monster), grant it immunity to destruction by battle this turn and change its ATK and name to that of the monster it battles. "Gagaga Samurai" attacks "Utopia Beyond" and the effect of "Gagaga Mirror Slash" becomes active ("Gagaga Samurai": 1900 → 3000 ATK). Only "Utopia Beyond" is destroyed and the effect of "Gagaga Mirror Slash" expires shortly after ("Gagaga Samurai": 3000 → 1900 ATK). Due to the second effect of "Gagaga Mirror Slash", Astral takes damage equal to the ATK of the destroyed monster (Astral: 4350 → 1350 LP). "Gagaga Samurai" attacks "Utopia Ray Victory" and the effect of "Gagaga Mirror Slash" becomes active ("Gagaga Samurai": 1900 → 2800 ATK). Astral activates his  face-down  " Heat & Heal " to target " Number 39: Utopia " (as it's the Xyz Monster with the lowest Rank on Astral's field), gain Life Points equal to its ATK (Astral: 1350 → 3850 LP), and attach "Heat & Heal" to "Utopia" as an Overlay Unit ("Utopia": 0 → 1 ORU). "Gagaga Samurai" then destroys "Utopia Ray Victory" and the effect of "Gagaga Mirror Slash" expires shortly after ("Gagaga Samurai": 2800 → 1900 ATK). The second effect of "Gagaga Mirror Slash" activates (Astral: 3850 → 1050 LP). Yuma Sets three cards.
 Turn 4: Astral 
Astral draws. "Utopia" attacks "Gagaga Cowboy", but Yuma activates his face-down " Half Unbreak " to prevent "Gagaga Cowboy" from being destroyed by battle this turn and halve the  battle damage  he takes. Astral activates his face-down " Absolute Buster " to negate all card effects that prevent a card's destruction or negate an attack during this turn. "Utopia" then destroys "Gagaga Cowboy" (Yuma: 1400 → 900 LP). Astral Sets three cards.
 Turn 5: Yuma 
 
         "Gagaga Samurai" attacks " Utopia ".     
 Yuma draws. He then activates " Gagagarevenge " to revive "Gagaga Cowboy" ( 4/1500/2400) in Attack Position (as it's a "Gagaga" monster). "Gagaga Cowboy" attacks "Utopia". Astral, assuming Yuma will activate a card on his field or in his hand in response to the attack, activates the effect of "Utopia" to detach "Heat & Heal" and negate the attack ("Utopia": 1 → 0 ORU). As an attack was negated, Yuma activates his face-down " Light Wing Bumper " to negate the effects of "Utopia" and decrease its ATK by 800 ("Utopia": 2500 → 1700 ATK). "Gagaga Samurai" attacks and destroys "Utopia" (Astral: 1050 → 850 LP). As a "Number" monster he controls was destroyed, Astral activates his face-down " Rank-Down-Magic Utopia Fall " to Rank-Down "Utopia" from the Graveyard via  Rank-Down Xyz De-Evolution  in order to Xyz Summon " Number 39: Utopia Roots " ( 1/500/100, ORU: 1) in Attack Position. Yuma Sets a card.
 Turn 6: Astral 
 
         " Utopia Roots " destroys " Gagaga Cowboy ".     
 Astral draws " Number Fortification " and subsequently activates it, equipping it to "Utopia Roots", increasing its ATK by 1500 ("Utopia Roots": 500 → 2000 ATK), and attaching " Number 32: Shark Drake " and " Number 62: Galaxy-Eyes Prime Photon Dragon " (both "Number" monsters) from his Extra Deck to "Utopia Roots" as Overlay Units ("Utopia Roots": 1 → 3 ORU). "Utopia Roots" attacks "Gagaga Cowboy", but Yuma activates the second effect of "Gagaga Samurai" to switch itself to  Defense Position  and change the  attack target  to "Gagaga Samurai". Astral activates his face-down " Rank Revolution " to target "Utopia Roots" and negate the effects of monsters whose Rank or  Level  is higher than the Rank of the targeted Xyz Monster while that Xyz Monster is on the field. "Utopia Roots" then destroys "Gagaga Cowboy" (Yuma: 900 → 400 LP). Astral activates his face-down " Overlay Accel " to detach "Shark Drake" from "Utopia Roots" ("Utopia Roots": 3 → 2 ORU) and allow "Utopia Roots" to attack again since it destroyed a monster by battle. "Utopia Roots" attacks and destroys "Gagaga Samurai" (Yuma: 400 → 300 LP).
 Duel continues in  the next episode.

 Mistakes 
 Several scenes show the old  card backings . They were corrected in the English dub. 
 Yuma remarks that he could never see any of the Utopia monsters "from the front", implying that they were always on his side of the field. However, during his duels with Flip,  Fortuno , and  Charlie McCay , "Number 39: Utopia" was on the opponent's side of the field, and "Utopia" and "Utopia Ray Victory" were under  control  of  Don Thousand  during their Duel. 
 Differences from the preview 
 In the preview, the five " Utopic "  monsters  were glowing, but when the episode aired, only " Number 39: Utopia Beyond " was. 
 
 Notes 
 
 ↑   This card can be seen on Yuma's D-Pad  during the flashback where Yuma recalled his moments with Astral.
