 Trivia 
 Regarding  Monster   Types :
 The  Dinosaur ,  Insect ,  Pyro , and  Rock -types had no representation until the Second Wave. 
 Across both waves of McDonald’s Promo cards, the only types that lacked representation were  Beast ,  Beast-Warrior ,  Fish ,  Plant ,  Reptile ,  Thunder , and  Winged Beast . 
 The  Psychic ,  Wyrm ,  Cyberse , and  Creator God -types are excluded from this equation, as these types did not exist at the time. 
 Divine-Beast  is also excluded, as it also had yet to be a legal monster type via the release of the Legal Version of " Obelisk the Tormentor " in late 2008. 
 Regarding Monster  Attributes :
 Aside from  DIVINE , no  WIND  Monsters were released in either wave (barring “ Elemental HERO Electrum ”, which adds the WIND Attribute via its effect). 
 Curiously, no  Trap Cards  were released in either wave.
