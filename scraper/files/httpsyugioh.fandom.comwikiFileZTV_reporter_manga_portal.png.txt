        ZTV broadcasting     
 ZTV  is a TV studio in the  Yu-Gi-Oh!  manga .
 
 Appearances 
 The director  from the channel tried making a false documentary on bullying,  Caught on Camera: School Violence  for  Survival Morning , in which he got his assistant director,  Fujita  to bully  Yugi . As punishment,  Dark Yugi  inflicted a  Penalty Game  onto the director, causing him to effectively go blind. [1] 
 Jonouchi  took part in the game show "Get the Million" on ZTV. The  producer  tried to rig the competition so that Jonouchi couldn't win the ¥1,000,000, but  Dark Yugi  spilled paint on the buttons, making him unable to tell which button rigs the wheel. Although Jonouchi won, the check turned out to be worthless after the studio went out of business, since Dark Yugi inflicted another Penalty Game onto the producer, causing him to go insane and insultingly demand money from viewers on live camera, which led to a complete drop in ratings.
