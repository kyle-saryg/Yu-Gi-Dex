 Kaiser!! 
 
 " The Final Duel Begins!! ", known as " Final Match, Start!! " in the Japanese version, is the thirty-eighth chapter of the  Yu-Gi-Oh! GX  manga . It was first printed in Japanese in the  V Jump  magazine and in English in the  Shonen Jump  magazine. Both of which were printed in  volume 5  of the  Yu-Gi-Oh! GX  graphic novels afterwards.
 Jaden  is too late to save  Midori  from  Reggie , and seeks revenge. At the volcano arena,  Chazz  and  Zane  begin their  Duel . Though he deals Zane no  damage , Chazz gains field control by Summoning his three most powerful  monsters .
 
 Summary 
 Reggie MacKenzie  tells  Jaden Yuki  that he's arrived at the  Abandoned Dorm  too late to do any good, realizing that the  spirit  of " Winged Kuriboh " had led Jaden there. She asks if Jaden knows what her objective is - to take the spirit card. She tells him she'll give up her quest if Jaden defeats her, but clarifies that the it won't be a normal game, but a  Shadow Duel . Jaden immediately accepts the Duel, wanting revenge for  Midori Hibiki 's fall.
 Chazz Princeton  and  Zane Truesdale  arrive at the volcano arena where their own Duel is to take place. The students are able to watch through the screens at  Duel Academy 's regular arena.  Bastion Misawa  states that he believes that Chazz wished to Duel Zane more than any other tournament entrant. Before Chazz had become Junior champion, that title had been dominated by Zane and  Atticus Rhodes . As they entered Duel Academy afterwards, he never had the opportunity to Duel either of them. Chazz himself admits that he had always compared himself to Zane and Atticus.
 Chazz takes the first turn and  Normal Summons  " Lancer Lindwurm " in  Attack Position  before  activating  " Twinborn Dragons ", which lets him  Special Summon  a  Dragon - Type   monster  from his  hand  with the same  level  as one on his  field . He Special Summons " Golem Dragon " in  Defense Position , whose  effect  will prevent other Dragon-Types on Chazz's field from becoming attack  targets . Chazz  Sets  a card and Zane begins his turn. Zane Summons " Cyber Larva " in Defense Position and Sets a card.
 Chazz  draws  " Dragonic Tactics ", which he Sets. Knowing that "Cyber Larva" will let Zane Special Summon another copy from his  Deck  if it is destroyed, he intends to  send  it to the  Graveyard  without destroying it. He attacks it with "Lancer Lindwurm", with the effect of "Larva" reducing the  Battle Damage  to 0. As a Dragon-Type monster destroyed a monster in  battle , Chazz is able to activate his  face-down  "Dragonic Tactics", which lets him  Tribute  "Lancer Lindwurm" and "Golem Dragon" to Special Summon the Level 8 " Dark End Dragon " from his Deck in Attack Position.  Alexis Rhodes  is shocked that Chazz called out "Dark End" so early in a Duel, while  Syrus Truesdale  seems fearful that his brother may lose. Though it may not attack this turn, Chazz can still use the effect of "Dark End". He does so, reducing its  ATK  and  DEF  by 500 to send "Cyber Larva" to the Graveyard - but not destroying it.
 Zane Special Summons " Cyber Dragon " in Attack Position via its effect and  equips  it with " Cyber Roar " which increases its ATK by 300 and lets Zane draw a card, which ends up being " Emergency Cyber ". Zane attacks and Chazz activates his face-down " Scale Mail ", reducing the ATK of "Dark End" by another 1000 to prevent its destruction in battle. His  Life Points  reduce to 2700 as a result. Alexis questions why Chazz took damage to protect his dragon. Chazz draws " Light and Darkness Dragon ", while his hand contains " Shadow's Light " and " Final Attack Orders ". He activates the former card, which lets him Special Summon a  LIGHT  monster from his Deck that has the same level as a  DARK  monster on his field. Thus, he Summons " Light End Dragon " in Attack Position. Alexis realizes that this was why Chazz ensured his Dragon escaped destruction. Chazz uses the effect of "Light End", decreasing its ATK and DEF by 500 to decrease the ATK of "Cyber Dragon" by 1500.
 Chazz declares he's not yet done. He activates his face-down " Lifeline from the Graveyard ", which will let him select two monsters in his Graveyard and  pay  Life Points equal to their combined levels times 100 to Special Summon the aforementioned monsters. He chooses "Lancer Lindwurm" and "Golem Dragon", so he pays 800 Life Points to Special Summon them. He Tributes them to Summon "Light and Darkness Dragon", as the crowd looks on in amazement.
 
 Featured Duel: Chazz Princeton vs. Zane Truesdale 
 Turn 1: Chazz 
 Chazz  draws. He then  Normal Summons  " Lancer Lindwurm " (1800/1200) in  Attack Position . He then  activates  " Twinborn Dragons ", letting him  Special Summon  " Golem Dragon " (200/2000) from his  hand  in  Defense Position . He then  Sets  a card.
 Turn 2: Zane 
 Zane  draws. He then Normal Summons " Cyber Larva " (400/600) in Defense Position and Sets a card.
 Turn 3: Chazz 
Chazz draws "Dragonic Tactics" and subsequently Sets it. "Lancer Lindwurm"  attacks  and  destroys  "Cyber Larva". Although "Lancer Lindwurm" has the ability of inflicting  piercing   battle damage , the  Battle Damage  is reduced to 0 via the  effect  of "Cyber Larva". "Cyber Larva"'s second effect activates, allowing Zane to Special Summon another "Cyber Larva" (400/600) from his  Deck  in Defense Position. As his  Dragon  destroyed a  monster   by battle , Chazz activates his  face-down  " Dragonic Tactics ",  Tributing  "Lancer Lindwurm" and "Golem Dragon" to Special Summon " Dark End Dragon " (2600/2100) from his Deck in Attack Position. The second effect of "Dragonic Tactics" automatically ends the Battle Phase. Chazz activates the effect of "Dark End Dragon", reducing its  ATK  and  DEF  by 500 ("Dark End Dragon": 2600 → 2100/2100 → 1600) in order to  send  "Cyber Larva" to the  Graveyard  without destroying it. As "Cyber Larva" was not destroyed in battle, its second effect does not activate. Chazz Sets a card.
 Turn 4: Zane 
Zane draws " Cyber Dragon " and subsequently Special Summons it (2100/1600) from his hand since Chazz controls a monster and he controls none. He then activates " Cyber Roar " and  equips  it to "Cyber Dragon", increasing its ATK by 300 ("Cyber Dragon": 2100 → 2400/1600), and letting him  draw a card  (" Emergency Cyber "). Zane attacks "Dark End Dragon" with "Cyber Dragon", but Chazz activates his face-down " Scale Mail ", reducing the ATK of "Dark End" by 1000 ("Dark End Dragon": 2100 → 1100/1600) in order to prevent its destruction in battle (Chazz: 4000 → 2700).
 Turn 5: Chazz 
Chazz draws "Light and Darkness Dragon". He then activates " Shadow's Light " from his hand, letting him Special Summon a  LIGHT  monster from his Deck that has the same  Level  as a  DARK  monster on his  field  by skipping his  Battle Phase . He Special Summons " Light End Dragon " (2600/2100) in Attack Position. He activates the effect of "Light End Dragon", decreasing its ATK and DEF by 500 ("Light End Dragon": 2600 → 2100/2100 → 1600) in order to decrease the ATK of "Cyber Dragon" by 1500 ("Cyber Dragon": 2400 → 900/1600). He then activates his face-down " Lifeline from the Graveyard ", letting him Special Summon two monsters from his Graveyard by  paying  Life Points equal to their combined Levels times 100. He pays 800 Life Points (Chazz: 2700 → 1900) to Special Summon the Level 4 "Lancer Lindwurm" and "Golem Dragon", both in Attack Position. He then tributes "Lindwurm" and "Golem Dragon" to  Tribute Summon  " Light and Darkness Dragon " (2800/2400) in Attack Position.
 Duel continues in  the next chapter
