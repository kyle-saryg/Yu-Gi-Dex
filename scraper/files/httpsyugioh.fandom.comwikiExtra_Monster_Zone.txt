 Extra Monster Zones  (エクストラモンスターゾーン  Ekusutora Monsutā Zōn , usually abbreviated  ＥＸ モンスターゾーン) are the 2  Monster Zones  in the center of the field in which  monsters   Summoned  from the  Extra Deck  are placed on the  field . These Monster Zones were introduced with the release of  Starter Deck 2017  in the  OCG  and  Starter Deck: Link Strike  in the  TCG .

 Mechanics 
 Extra Monster Zones are  exclusively  used to place monsters that would be Special Summoned from the Extra Deck. A single player can only use  one  Extra Monster Zone at a time, unless there is an  Extra Link  to the other Extra Monster Zone.
 In the new  Master Rules  applying from April 1, 2020 onwards,  Fusion ,  Synchro  and  Xyz Monsters  can also be Summoned from  face-down  Extra Deck to a  Main Monster Zone .
 Monsters  Pendulum Summoned  from  face-up  Extra Deck, and  Link Monsters , must be Summoned to an Extra Monster Zone, or  Main Monster Zones  a  Link Arrow   points to .
 
 Other details 
 If control of a monster in an Extra Monster Zone is changed, it is placed in a Main Monster Zone, even when returning control to its owner. If a monster in an Extra Monster Zone is temporarily  banished , it is placed in a Main Monster Zone when it  returns  to the field.
 While an Extra Monster Zone is unoccupied or when a monster is about to be Summoned to that Extra Monster Zone, that zone is not treated as being part of either player's  field . While a player controls a monster in an Extra Monster Zone, that zone is considered to be part of that player's field.
 However, even if the opponent controls both Extra Monster Zones due to an Extra Link, this does not prevent the player from Special Summoning to an Extra Monster Zone by using a monster in one of the Extra Monster Zones as  Material  (e.g.  Special Summoning  " Chimeratech Fortress Dragon " using an opponent's  Machine  Link Monster in the Extra Monster Zone as a  Fusion Material ).
 
 Master Rule 4 
 If a monster was  Special Summoned  from the  Extra Deck , it must be placed in either a  Main Monster Zone  a  Link Monster   points to  or an Extra Monster Zone.
