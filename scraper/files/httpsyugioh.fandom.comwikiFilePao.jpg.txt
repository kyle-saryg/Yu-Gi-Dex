 Biography 
       Pao as Zorc Arm Dragon.     
 After  Hiroto  shot off  Zorc's  left arm, it turned into 2 monsters, Zorc Arm Dragon and an  eyeball . After  Joey  took out the eyeball, Yugi tried to brainwash Zorc Arm Dragon. There was only a 10% chance of it working, but using his "double hit" strategy with the dice,  Dark Yugi  was able to roll a critical allowing Yugi to brainwash the dragon.
 Now known as Pao, the dragon joined Yugi's party and helped them fight Zorc, when they got to the castle.
