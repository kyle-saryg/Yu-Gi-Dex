 Biography 
 The Familiar and the  Red Nova  implanted a dream in  Greiger , where he saw  Jack Atlas  die, by relying on power. As a result, Greiger invited  Jack Atlas  to the Nazca region in the hope of overcoming this. He got Jack to  Turbo Duel  against  Max . However, the Familiar possessed Max and changed his  Deck . The Duel was halted due to Jack falling off of his D-Wheel. [1] 
 Angry over the result of the Duel, Jack went to  a village . Here,  a villager  informed him that the village had been abandoned due to the works of the Crimson Devil. The Familiar then appeared in its demon form, taunting Jack into chasing it. After running around the village, Jack was brought back to the villager, who was now possessed by the Familiar and accompanied by the Crimson Devil in the form of a flame. The Familiar identified itself as the faithful servant of the Crimson Devil and asked Jack what he desired. Jack replied that it was power and the Familiar offered Jack to join the Devil's side, saying that they would be waiting at the  shrine . It left the villager's body, causing him to pass out. [2] 
 
       The Familiar facing Jack in the  ritual Duel .     
 When Jack arrived at the top of the shrine, he was transported to a hidden chamber. The Familiar told Jack that his master is locked away and has been waiting for Jack. Jack demanded the power and the Familiar offered it, under the condition that he and Jack perform the  contracted ritual ; if Jack defeats the Familiar in a Duel, the Devil will grant him overwhelming power. Jack agreed. Yusei, Greiger and Max followed Jack with Greiger informing Jack how they had all been used. However the ritual Duel had already begun as planned and the Familiar revealed that if Jack loses, his body will become host to the Crimson Devil and his friends will be fed to his master in the sacrifice. [2] 
 The Familiar used a " Yomi " Lock strategy, which countered Jack's power strategy. Jack developed new tactics to fight back. When both players  Life Points  were low, the chamber began to fall apart and the Crimson Devil started to appear. However Jack used " Blazing Soul " to absorb  Red Nova 's power and create the card, " Red Nova Dragon ", which he used to defeat the Familiar. The statue of Red Nova then fell over, crushing the Familiar. [3] 
 The Familiar of Red-Nova may be a reference to the Sons of Muspellheimr in Norse mythology who are fire demons. The Familiar of Red-Nova is also a fire demon.
 
 Abilities 
 The Familiar's most used power is his ability to possess people. It has been used on  Greiger ,  Max  and  a villager  in the series. 
 Another ability is to fire energy blasts from his hand, which he used to destroy the stairs and the exit to the  Earthbound Immortal Shrine  and to knock  Yusei  off his feet. 
 He was also able to destroy the floor surrounding Jack, trapping him in the center of the room, unable to reach anyone outside of the duel.
 
 Deck 
 The Familiar uses a  " Yomi " Deck . It uses cards that quickly inflict  effect damage  while protecting himself with various  stall   effects . It consists of low  Level   Fiend - Type  monsters that can be quickly destroyed to inflict damage.
 Instead of cards, the Familiar uses tablets, similar to the tablets used in Ancient Egypt, which had monster  Ka  sealed inside them.
