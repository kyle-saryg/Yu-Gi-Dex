 Personality 
 Despite his imposing size, Beauregard has a very gentle and unsure personality– much like  Brier – which was the result of past bullying. This shared history and common struggle was ultimately why the two found a strong kinship with one another. He is a man of few words, mostly due to his timidity, but displays a fierce loyalty and devotion towards Brier. Beauregard's ultimate dream is to become a game designer, like  Chumley Huffington , but his lack of skill when it comes to Dueling holds him back.
 
 Yu-Gi-Oh! GX 
 Season 1 
 Having been being bullied for his size by  Obelisk Blue  students in the past, Beauregard teamed up with  Brier  to combat the pair's detractors. The two joined forces to create a combined persona called the " Duel Giant ." Beauregard played the part of the  Duelist  while Brier fed him instructions and dialogue via a radio headset during Duels. The duo took revenge on several Obelisk Blue students using Beauregard's imposing size to terrorize the bullies into unauthorized  Ante Duels , after which they stole the Obelisks' rare cards.
 Eventually, word reached  Dr. Crowler  who then "hires"  Jaden Yuki  to defeat the "Duel Giant"– intending to expel him from the academy if he fails. After watching Brier lose to an Obelisk Blue bully, Jaden and  Winged Kuriboh  watch as Brier leaves the arena to meet with Beauregard. His massive size led Jaden to suspect him as the Duel Giant, but the two also noted his lack of any fighting spirit. After he and Brier are stopped and humiliated by a group of Obelisk Blues, Jaden catches up with Beauregard and identifies him as the Duel Giant. However, Brier and Beauregard flee before Beauregard can accept Jaden's challenge. At midnight, Jaden and his friends wait for the Duel Giant, finding the Giant after he defeats the bully from the previous afternoon. Jaden challenges the Giant to a match. He quickly exposes Brier and Beauregard's trick, and convinces the two to battle him out in the open in exchange for not turning them in. Brier and Beauregard return the stolen cards and resolve to become stronger as individuals together.
 
 Season 3 
 Beauregard is one of the Academy students that was turned into a  Duel Ghoul . He is later free after Jaden beats  Marcel Bonaparte / Yubel 
 
 Season 4 
 Beauregard made a cameo in  episode 179 , watching Jaden's Graduation ceremony.
