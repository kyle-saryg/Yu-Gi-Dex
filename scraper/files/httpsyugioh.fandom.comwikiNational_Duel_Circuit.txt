 The  National Duel Circuit  was a tournament held in  Heartland  where  Reginald Kastle ,  Quattro  and other  Duelists  participated, appearing in  Yu-Gi-Oh! ZEXAL .
 Reginald and Quattro faced each other in the tournament's finals. However, Quattro intentionally put his  Deck  on top of a pot, so that it fell and wound up scattered on the floor in the break room when Shark passed by it. As a result, Reginald was disqualified before unleashing his winning move because he had seen Quattro's Deck before the  Duel . Therefore, Quattro was considered the champion of the tournament.
