 History 
 In the early stages of the game, Sea Serpent-Type monsters and Fish-Type monsters acted as a pair, with Fish-Type monsters being weaker lower-Level monsters, and Sea Serpent-Type monsters being the more powerful higher-Level monsters. (This is equivalent to the old relationship between  Dinosaur -Type monsters and  Reptile -Type monsters).
 Prior to the release of  Raging Battle  , the only support card Sea Serpent-Type monsters had was " Umi " (which was later replaced in usage by " A Legendary Ocean ", which does not support them).  Raging Battle  introduced the Sea Serpent support cards " Spined Gillman ", " Mermaid Archer " and " Deep Sea Diva ", with the latter being the first card to exclusively support Sea Serpents. In contrast to early Sea Serpents, which were generally very strong high- Level  monsters, the new Sea Serpents and their support focus on low- Level  monsters and swarming, which allows for a viable Sea Serpent-based Deck.
 In  Photon Shockwave  and  Generation Force , additional support was introduced for Sea Serpent-Type monsters, including " Shark Stickers ", " Fish and Kicks ", and " Oh F!sh! ". After  Realm of the Sea Emperor  and  Abyss Rising , Sea Serpent-Type monsters became competitive with the creation of the " Merlantean " Deck.

 " Subterror Behemoth Stygokraken " is the only EARTH Sea Serpent-Type monster, as well as the first to also be a  Flip monster .
