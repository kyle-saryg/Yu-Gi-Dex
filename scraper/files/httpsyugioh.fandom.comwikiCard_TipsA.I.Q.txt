 This card can be searched by " A Cat of Ill Omen ", " The Despair Uranus " and " Pikari @Ignister ". 
 This card is at best a  Side Deck  option for " @Ignister " decks against decks that don't use  Extra Deck  monsters other than  Link Monsters . Also, due to its  maintenance cost , it is best used like a  Normal Trap Card  whose activation can be stopped by Spell/Trap removal.
