 Welcome to the  Yu-Gi-Oh!  anime  portal. This page contains information about the  Yu-Gi-Oh!  anime.
 Yu-Gi-Oh!  tells the tale of  Yugi Muto , a high school student who was given the fragmented pieces of an ancient Egyptian artifact, the  Millennium Puzzle , by his grandfather. Upon reassembling the Puzzle, he is possessed by another personality who is later revealed to be the spirit of a 3,000-year-old Pharaoh (5,000-years-old in the English anime) called  Yami Yugi , with no memory of his own time. As the story goes on, the two of them (together with Yugi's friends), try to find the secret of the Pharaoh's lost memories and his name, with the  Duel Monsters  card game being an ever prevalent backdrop or plot device.
