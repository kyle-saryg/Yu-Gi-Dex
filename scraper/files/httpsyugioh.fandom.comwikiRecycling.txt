" Recycling " is a method in which cards from the  Graveyard  are often reused. Also known as "recursion". Some of the best cards for recycling are " Exodius the Ultimate Forbidden Lord ", " Necroface ", and " Recycle ". If your deck contains all three of these cards, and you play it right, your deck will never run out.
