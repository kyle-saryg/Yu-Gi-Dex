 Spell Monsters  are a type of  Continuous Spell Card  that is  Special Summoned  as a  Monster Card  after it is activated.
 All of these cards are treated as both  Monster Cards  and  Spell Cards  while they are summoned to the field, and as such, take up both a  Monster Card Zone  and a  Spell & Trap Card Zone  at the same time.
 Spell Monsters cannot be activated on your opponent's turn, making them unable to perform the "Emergency" Defense that  Trap Monsters  can. They can instead provide an immediate source of  Tribute Fodder , much like some cards do already, like " Fiend's Sanctuary ".
 As shown in  Yu-Gi-Oh! GX  they can be used as  Fusion Material , as  Jaden  was able to fuse his " Elemental HERO Neos " with "The Rival's Name" (which was being treated as " Rainbow Dragon ") to create " Rainbow Neos ".
 In  Yu-Gi-Oh! ZEXAL   and  ARC-V , they are shown to be able to be used as  Xyz Material , with  Fortuno  overlaying "Xyz Plant" with " Rainbow Shaman " to Summon " Number 11: Big Eye " in  ZEXAL , and  Yuto  overlaying two copies of "The Phantom Knights of Shadow Veil" to Summon " Dark Rebellion Xyz Dragon " in  ARC-V .
