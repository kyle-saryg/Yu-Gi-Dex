 Prior 
 Yugi Muto  was still devastated after his loss to  Seto Kaiba  and losing his chance to save his grandfather, and vows to never duel again. Mai appears before them and after hearing about what happened, decides to give Yugi five of her star chips.  Tristan Taylor  points out that without those star chips she won't gain entry into the castle, but Mai reveals she has won ten of hers and the five are extras. Yugi however refuses, so Mai decides to duel him for it. When Yugi does not respond, Mai gets annoyed until Téa offers to duel in Yugi's place, and Mai accepts.
