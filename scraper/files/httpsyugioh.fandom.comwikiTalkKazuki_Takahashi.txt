 List of Cards Made by Kazuki Takahashi 
 I think we're overdue for some kind of listing of cards designed and drawn by Kazuki Takahashi. There's the cards that he personally drew, and then the cards where his linework was used for the official card (which is probably most cards from the manga).

 Featured Cards in Duel Art 
 I think the page could use all of the known cards Takahashi designed for the post-original series', though not all of them are labeled. If someone else with the book could help identifying all the monster sketches, that would be really helpful. Here's what I have so far:
 
 Elemental Hero Neos 
 Neo-Spacian Grand Mole 
 Yubel 
 Yubel - Terror Incarnate 
 Yubel - The Ultimate Nightmare 
 Stardust Dragon 
 Red Dragon Archfiend 
 Black Rose Dragon 
 Power Tool Dragon 
 Ancient Fairy Dragon 
 Red Nova Dragon  (it's labeled as such, but the art doesn't seem to reflect this Monster) 
 Number 39: Utopia 
 Number C39: Utopia Ray 
 Number 34: Terror-Byte 
 Shooting Star Dragon 
 Galaxy-Eyes Photon Dragon
