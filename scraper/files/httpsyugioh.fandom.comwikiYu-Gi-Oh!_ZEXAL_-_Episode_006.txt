 Summary 
 
 This article  may require  cleanup  to meet this wiki's standards.   You can help out by re-organizing or re-writing parts of it or checking grammar and spelling.   
 Flip  has just summoned " Utopia " from  Yuma 's  Extra Deck  using " Ultra C "; however, a shock from "Utopia" causes Flip to fall down and a dark aura appears around him. "Utopia" tells Flip, "Let the 'Number' take hold" as the symbol for Number 39 appears on his right hand.  Astral  falls to his knees and lights appear around him, circling him in a cocoon. Yuma realizes that in a "Number" Duel, the winner gets to absorb the losers "Number", and if that happens, then Astral will disappear.
 Yuma decides the only way to win is to take down "Utopia", but for that he needs a " Number " monster. Luckily, he has two, " Number 17: Leviathan Dragon " and " Number 34: Terror-Byte ". With only the Level 4 " Gagaga Magician " and the Level 2 " Flelf " on his field, he can't do anything at the moment, so reluctantly Yuma ends his turn. Flip begins his turn and uses "Utopia" to attack "Flelf" bringing Yuma's  LP  down to 1900. He  sets  a Monster and ends his turn.
 Yuma begins his turn by summoning the Level 3 " Rai Rider " and then using "Gagaga Magician"'s effect to change its Level to 3. He then  overlays  "Gagaga Magician" and "Rai Rider" to  Xyz Summon  " Number 17: Leviathan Dragon ". Flip activates his  Trap Card  " Traitor Fog ", changing control of "Leviathan Dragon" to his side of the field. This causes Astral to disappear fully into the cocoon and the symbol for Number 17 to appear on Flip's left hand. Elsewhere,  Bronk  and  Tori  are checking out the photos on a laptop that show Yuma playing pranks and crushing flowers. Tori zooms into the photo and realizes that it was a cut and paste. They both decide they need to find  Spencer , who was in one of the photos. Tori decides to phone him. He answers but doesn't tell them where he is and ends the call, but the chimes Tori heard in the background gave away his location.
 
       " Number 39: Utopia " and " Leviathan Dragon " under  Flip 's control     Back at the duel, Yuma asks Flip why he's so mean. Flip replies saying, "I'm not mean, the world is, and I learned it the hard way, Yuma! You see, I wasn't always like this. I was once a sap like you." Flip then explains to Yuma how he became like this. Back when he was just entering the  Duel Monsters  world, older children took advantage of his ignorance towards Dueling to cheat him out of his cards through Ante Duels, saying they would accelerate his improvement when the stakes were higher. He eventually found out, running home in tears and vowing revenge. It was then he learned about the "flip side", which applied not only to Duels, but to life itself. Later on, he Dueled the children and not only took all of his cards back, but also, to his surprise, earned their respect.  Flip says that Dueling is all about winning, which Yuma protests that it's not. He explains that it's about having fun and doing the best you can do. Flip is unmoved, saying that only losers talk like that.
 Meanwhile, Bronk and Tori are still looking for Spencer. They realize the only place neither of them has checked is the old gym. Tori and Bronk run in and shout "Spencer!", causing him to lose his concentration and hit the dominoes with the one he was placing, causing all of them to fall. Tori apologizes for interrupting, and asks why he is setting up all those dominoes. He says that Flip said he would give him an  Xyz Monster  if he stayed in there all day setting the dominoes up for him.  Tori  and  Bronk  then realize that Flip sent out the photos and asked  Spencer  to hide out in here so he couldn't tell anyone the picture were fake. Then they understand why Flip did it; he wanted a Duel with Yuma.
 Back at the duel, Yuma thinks that he needs to summon " Terror-Byte " and looks at " Release Lease " in his hand. He considers using that card to sacrifice  Baby Tiragon  to move a Level 3 Monster from his deck to his hand. Before he can, Astral says "Protect Tiragon". Reluctantly, Yuma switches Baby Tiragon to  Defense Position  and  sets  a card. Flip begins his turn and comments that it will be the last. Elsewhere, Bronk and Tori are still searching for Yuma. They decide to look in the mall.
 Back at the duel, Flip uses " Leviathan Dragon's " effect raising its ATK to 2500, the same as "Utopia". He Flip Summons " Flipangutan " and uses its effect to switch "Baby Tiragon" into Attack Mode. He then uses "Leviathan Dragon" to attack it. Luckily, Yuma has a plan and uses the trap card " Half Unbreak " to protect his monster from being destroyed this turn and cut the battle damage in half. Yuma's LP drop to 1100 and Flip sends " Utopia " to attack "Baby Tiragon". Thanks to the effect of "Half Unbreak", Yuma's monster is still safe, but his LP are now at 300.
 
       " Baby Tiragon " and " Stinging Swordsman ".     
 Flip then uses the spell " Book of Flip " to flip "Flipangutan" face-down, which means next turn he'll use its effect and wipe out Yuma's remaining LP and take "Utopia" from him. Bronk and Tori arrive and see the differences between Yuma and Flip's LP 300 and 2500, as well as "Utopia" and "Leviathan Dragon" under Flip's control. He then draws " Stinging Swordsman ", noting that it's not the kind of defense he was hoping for due to its low ATK and DEF. Flip notices that it wasn't the card Yuma needed and says that it's hopeless, since his last line of defense is a low-ATK  Xyz Monster . Yuma disagrees saying "Points don't make the monster!", then he remembers what Astral said about protecting "Baby Tiragon". Yuma then starts thinking about the "flip side" himself; a weak Monster can still have a great effect. He summons "Stinging Swordsman". Flip then says that monster won't damange him. Yuma replies that it will, because "Baby Tiragon" is not as useless as it looks and "because "I'm feeling the flow!" Yuma activates "Tiragon"'s effect, using one Overlay Unit so the Level 1 "Stinging Swordsman" can attack Flip directly. Flip taunts Yuma, saying that taking 300 points of damage isn't much, as his LP drops to 2200. However, Yuma uses "Stinging Swordsman"'s effect to return all of Flip's Spell and Trap cards to his hand. Flip drops to the ground as the  Numbers ' influence leaves him and "Utopia" and "Leviathan Dragon" go back to Yuma's field, causing Astral's strength to return. Astral stands up and calls for "Leviathan Dragon" to attack Flip's face-down monster, which makes Yuma mad. But Yuma says that it was a good move and uses "Leviathan Dragon" to attack  Flipangutan  who was face-down, then uses "Utopia" to attack directly.
 
         " Utopia " attacks Flip.     
 Flip is sent flying backwards, as his LP drop to 0 and Yuma is the winner. Bronk and Tori cheer and congratulate Yuma. Astral also says "Nicely done". Yuma walks over to Flip and goes to give him the "Baby Tiragon" card back and says he's earned it, along with Yuma's respect by not cheating. Flip thinks that this is a trick and Yuma is going to make him look a fool. Yuma says there's no way he could make Flip look like a fool, complimenting his glasses. Flip starts crying and says that's the nicest thing anyone's ever said to him. He stops crying and says he'll start over and tells Yuma he can keep the card. Yuma is happy about that because he did form a bond with it, and the card is a symbol of their friendship. Astral says "Observation No.9: Glasses are 'hip'". Elsewhere,  Spencer  is still putting up dominoes and has one left. He goes to put it down, but accidentally hits one with his shoe, causing them all to fall.

 Errors 
 In the English Dub, when Yuma's hand is shown, it contains "Overconfidence", an unnamed Monster, an unnamed Spell and "Book of Flip" instead of the correct cards.
