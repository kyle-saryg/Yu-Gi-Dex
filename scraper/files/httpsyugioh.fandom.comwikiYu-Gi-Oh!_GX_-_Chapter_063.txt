 Beyond the Struggle… 
 
 "The Threat of the Sun!!"  is the sixty-third chapter of the  Yu-Gi-Oh! GX  manga . It was first printed in Japan on February 21, 2011 in  V Jump  magazine. It was first printed in Japanese in the  V Jump  magazine and in English in the  Shonen Jump  magazine. Both of which were printed in  volume 9  of the  Yu-Gi-Oh! GX  graphic novels afterwards.
 " The Supremacy Sun " devastates  Jaden  and  Chazz , while  Tragoedia  steadily gains  Life Points  via the  effect  of " Ebon Sun ". Even with " Light and Darkness Dragon " and Jaden's strongest  Fusion Monsters , they cannot  destroy  it permanently. In dire straits, Chazz declares that he entrusts the Duel to Jaden's next  draw  and " Winged Kuriboh " is Summoned.
 
 Summary 
 Jaden  cannot read the  effect  of " The Supremacy Sun " via his  Duel Disk 's function.  Tragoedia  reveals that he erased the display, but says that he'll show them the true form of "The Sun" now.  Syrus  and  Alexis  question what he means by form. Tragoedia states that the sun was revered as an absolute God in his time. It was a God of resurrection who could travel through both the world of darkness and world of light. Tragoedia finally reveals the  effect . The  turn  after "The Supremacy Sun" is  sent  to the  Graveyard , it returns to the  field . A molten sun rises above the field, surrounded by four pillars. "The Supremacy Sun" slowly emerges from it. No matter how many times they defeat it, it will simply return. Jaden curses.
 The  ATK  of "The Sun" is 3000 and  Chazz  knows that it will  attack  his " Red Wyrm " on the next turn, causing he and Jaden to take a large amount of damage. He evaluates his  hand , which contains " Light End Dragon " and " Dragon's Charge ". He seems to get an idea. "Red Wyrm" attacks and destroys " Thousand-Eyed Ghost ". The effect of the destroyed monster activates, and Tragoedia  Special Summons  the  Level  1 " One-Eyed Ghost " in  Defense Position . Chazz plays the  Quick-Play Spell Card , "Dragon's Charge" from his hand. Since a  Dragon - Type  monster destroyed a monster, he may  draw a card . If it is a Dragon-Type monster, Chazz may  Normal Summon  it. He draws " Light and Darkness Dragon ", which he Normal Summons in Defense Position by  Tributing  "Red Wyrm" and " Samsara Dragon " Tragoedia greets the  Feather of Ma'at  after three-thousand years, and says its disgraceful for it to be in Defense Position. Tragoedia begins his turn, stating that now that he has his full strength back, the Feather of Ma'at is no threat to him. "The Supremacy Sun" attacks and destroys "Light and Darkness Dragon" using  Solar Flare . 
 Chazz apologizes to "Light and Darkness", and Tragoedia activates " Ebon Sun ". It will increase Tragoedia's  Life Points  by the  ATK  of any of his own monsters that are destroyed. Should a monster be Special Summoned from the Graveyard, it will gain 1000 ATK. Tragoedia immediately takes advantage of these effects by activating his  face-down  " Self Destruct ", destroying all monsters he controls. He gains 3300 Life Points - the sum of the ATKs of "The Sun" and "One-Eyed Ghost".  Midori  and  Zane  are worried now, as Tragoedia has 6700 Life Points. Jaden draws " Pot of Greed ", while he has " Terra Firma Gravity " Set. "The Supremacy Sun"  revives  with its ATK increased to 4000 via "Ebon Sun". Jaden activates "Pot of Greed", drawing " Construct Element " and " Miracle Fusion ". He Normal Summons " Elemental Hero Stratos " and then plays "Miracle Fusion",  removing  "Stratos" and the " Elemental Hero Ocean " in his Graveyard from play to Fusion Summon " Elemental Hero Absolute Zero " in  Attack Position . He then plays " Parallel World Fusion ", returning the same two  Fusion Material Monsters  to his  Deck  to Fusion Summon " Elemental Hero Great Tornado " in Attack Position. Its effect activates, halving the ATK and  DEF  of "The Sun". "Great Tornado" attacks and destroys "The Sun", while "Absolute Zero" attacks  directly . Due to the effect of "Ebon Sun", Tragoedia regains the ATK of "The Sun" as Life Points, leaving him with 6400. Jaden declares that isn't done yet, though. He activates the Quick-Play Spell Card "Construct Element", returning "Great Tornado" and "Absolute Zero" to his  Extra Deck  and Summoning " Elemental Hero "  Fusion Monsters  of the same Levels - " Elemental Hero Inferno " and " Elemental Hero The Shining ". Both attack directly, leaving Tragoedia with 1500 Life Points. Syrus cheers, but Midori and Alexis remind him that "The Sun" will still return with 4000 ATK. "The Sun" does just that as Tragoedia begins his turn.
 Tragoedia compliments Jaden and Chazz, telling them that they've done better than he expected them to. He activates " Prominence ",  equipping  it to "The Sun". With this, he may destroy the equipped monster and all monsters on the field, inflicting 500 damage for each opponent's monster destroyed. Tragoedia reiterates that their Life Points represent the actual life that they have remaining and asks them if they think their lives will last forever - human lifespan is like that of a bug in comparison to his. Jaden responds that he doesn't mind being a bug, and Chazz retorts that it's better to be a bug than a monster like Tragoedia. "The Sun" attacks and destroys "Inferno", reducing Chazz and Jaden to 1000 Life Points as they fall to their knees screaming. He uses the effect of "Prominence", destroying "The Sun" and all cards on his opponents' field. Jaden and Chazz take 500 damage as "The Shining" is destroyed, while Tragoedia gains 3000 Life Points via "Ebon Sun". Tragoedia Sets a card and ends his turn, taunting them that he had hoped they would have lasted longer. Chazz draws and "The Sun" is returned to the field with 4000 ATK. Syrus thinks that it's impossible to win now.
 Knowing that Tragoedia's tactics involve destroying his own field, Chazz assumes that his Set card will do something of that sort. Chazz removes the "Samsara Dragon" in his Graveyard from play, which will let him Special Summon one Dragon-Type monster from his Graveyard. Tragoedia activates his face-down " Annihilating Light ", which will destroy all monsters during the  End Phase  of this turn. Chazz Special Summons "Light and Darkness Dragon" from his Graveyard. Tragoedia clarifies that since he activated "Annihilating Light" before "Light and Darkness Dragon" was Summoned, the effect of the latter card cannot  negate  it. Chazz ends his turn, meaning all monsters are destroyed. Tragoedia's Life Points recover by 3000 once more via "Ebon Sun". Still during the End Phase, Chazz activates the Quick-Play Spell Card " Miracle of Draconian Wrath " from his hand. As a Dragon-Type monster was destroyed, Chazz may Set two  Spell  or  Trap Cards  from his Deck. He Sets " Negate Attack " and " Hopeful Future ". Tragoedia tells Chazz he's quite stubborn, but that only means Tragoedia will be entertained further. "The Sun" revives with 4000 ATK. Intent on finding out what Chazz Set, Tragoedia attacks directly with "The Sun". Chazz activates his face-down "Negate Attack", negating the attack and ending the  Battle Phase . Syrus is relived that they survived one more turn. Tragoedia questions if the two are running out of ideas, and states he's done playing with them - he'll finish the Duel on his next turn. Chazz tells Jaden that everything will be decided on Jaden's turn. He tells him that he entrusts him with his last Set card, and that his best draw must come now. Jaden draws, and everyone watches closely as he Summons " Winged Kuriboh " in Defense Position. As Tragoedia's heart no longer occupies it, it appears as white as it once did in Ancient Egypt.

The effect of "Thousand-Eyed Ghost"  activates , letting Tragoedia Special Summon a  Level  4 or lower  monster  from his  Deck .
