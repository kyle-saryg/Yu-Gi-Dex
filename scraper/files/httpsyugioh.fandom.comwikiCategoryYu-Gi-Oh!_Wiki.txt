This is our top-level category; looking at it another way, it is the root category.
 Ideally, every other category should be a subcategory of at least one other, and every article should be in at least one category; many will fit well into two or more (e.g. location, year, and subject-matter).
 The "Yu-Gi-Oh!" category is intended for all articles about  Yu-Gi-Oh! , whilst "Wiki Content" is intended for all administrative matters. A full list of existing categories can be found at  Special:Categories .
 To add a new category to a page, just add  [[Category:Categoryname]]  to the end of the article or existing category page.
