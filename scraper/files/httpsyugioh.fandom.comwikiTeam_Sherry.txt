 Team Sherry  is a team participating in the  WRGP . The team is made up of two members,  Sherry LeBlanc  and  Elsworth . Their aim within the WRGP is to defeat other duel teams in order to get to the top in order to get closer to  Iliaster  for killing Sherry's parents. The team was removed from the WRGP due to Iliaster  falsifying history  and replacing them with  Team New World . Sherry originally wanted  Yusei Fudo  to become the third member, but he declined. It is known within their first duel, Sherry took out all three of the opponents team without taking damage. Since the team is made up of two members, both wheelers started with 8000  Life Points  instead of the 12000 which is split between the three. Although the duel team hasn't been seen dueling, it is known that they managed to sweep their way through the first rounds of the WRGP with ease.
