      The School Festival.     
 The  Domino High school festival  is an annual event at  Domino High School . Different classes set-up stalls to raise money.
 On the thirtieth year,  Anzu Mazaki 's class won the most popular spot in a raffle and began setting-up their  Carnival Games  booth there. However,  Goro Inogashira  and his class took over their spot for their cooked Hiroshima-style okonomiyaki stall.  Dark Yugi  later faced Goro in a game of  Griddle Ice Hockey  to win back the spot.
