 " Helping a Friend ", known in Japan as " Resolve " is the twenty-forth episode of the  Yu-Gi-Oh! SEVENS  anime. It aired in Japan on November 14, 2020.
 Yuga  doesn't show up when promised. Worried,  Luke ,  Gavin , and  Romin  go search for a way to beat  Nail . They go where it all began, the Relic, and demand an answer from  Otes . To give them the hint they want, Otes places a condition. That is to "win" a Duel, and to have "resolve"!

 Featured Duels 
 The Duels are conducted as  Rush Duels . 
Even though these are three separate duels, Otes makes the same moves in all three Duels. 
 Turn 1: Otes 
Otes Normal Summons " Black Dragon's Chick " (800/500). He activates its effect, sending it to the GY to Special Summon " Red-Eyes Black Dragon " (2400/2000) from his hand in Attack Position. Since he controls "Red-Eyes Black Dragon", Otes activates " Inferno Fire Blast ", inflicting 2400 damage to the opponent and preventing "Red-Eyes Black Dragon" from attacking this turn (Gavin/Romin/Luke: 4000 → 1600 LP). Otes sets 2 cards.
 
 Gavin Sogetsu vs. Otes 
 Turn 2: Gavin 
Gavin Normal Summons " Turtle Keeper of Traditions " (0/1400) and " Binding Chain " (1000/1100), then tributes them to Tribute Summon " Fiendish Commander Kimeruler " (2500/2000). Since his opponent Tribute Summoned a monster, Otes activates his set Trap " Black Dragon's Bellow ", letting him return 1 Spell Card from his GY to the top of his Deck and increase the ATK and DEF of "Red-Eyes Black Dragon" by 700 until the end of the turn. He returns "Inferno Fire Blast" ("Red-Eyes Black Dragon": 2400/2000 → 3100/2700). Gavin activates " Chestnuts Out of the Fire ", letting him send the top card of his deck to the GY and if it is a monster, he can increase the ATK of a Warrior monster he controls by the Level of the sent monster x 300 until the end of the turn, but he wil also take damage equal to that amount. He sends the Level 5 " Kesshin the Decided Death Fiendish Commander " and targets "Kimeruler" ("Kimeruler": 2500 → 4000 ATK; Gavin: 1600 → 100 LP). Gavin activates " Block Attack ", letting him change 1 Attack Position monster Otes controls to face-up Defense Position". He targets "Red-Eyes Black Dragon". 
 Gavin activates the effect of "Kimeruler" since it was Normal Summoned this turn and Otes controls no Attack Position monsters, letting him send the top card of his deck to the GY to allow "Kimeruler" to attack directly this turn. "Kimeruler" attacks Otes directly (Otes: 4000 → 0 LP).
 
 Romin Kirishima vs. Otes 
 Turn 2: Romin 
Most of the turn is skipped. Romin controls " Esperaid of the Smashing Light " (2500/0) and " Romic'n'Roller " (1700/0).
 "Esperaid" attacks Otes directly (Otes: 2300 → 0 LP).
 
 Lucidien "Luke" Kallister vs. Otes 
 Turn 2: Luke 
Most of the turn is skipped. Luke controls " Rush Dragon Dragears " (2500/1500) and " Gravity Press Dragon " (1500/1000).
 "Dragears" attacks Otes directly (Otes: 2400 → 0 LP). [Notes 1]

 ↑   Luke indicates that the direct attack from Dragears was its 2nd attack, meaning he likely used the effect of "Dragears" beforehand.
