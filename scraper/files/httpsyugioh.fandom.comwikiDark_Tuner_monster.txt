 Dark Tuner monsters  (known as "Minus Tuner Monsters" in the  manga ) are a monster type that made its debut in  Yu-Gi-Oh! 5D's  in  episode 27 .  Dark Synchro Monsters  are  Synchro Summoned  by sending to the  Graveyard  1 Dark Tuner monster and 1 non-Dark Tuner monster. The Dark Tuner monster's  Level  minus the non-Dark Tuner monster's  Level  must be equal to the  Dark Synchro Monster 's Level.
 Dark Tuner monsters are not just  DARK   Attribute   Tuner monsters , but are a completely different kind of monster, identified by having Dark Tuner listed after their  Type . However, according to  Yu-Gi-Oh! 5D's Tag Force 4 , Dark Tuners act as a subcategory of Tuner monsters. Any card that would affect a Tuner can affect a Dark Tuner the same way.
 Unlike regular Tuner monsters, the Dark Tuners usually have higher Levels, with the exception of " Dark Tuner Dark Ape " and " Dark Tuner Dark Goddess Witaka ", due to the fact that their Levels must be subtracted from the remainder of the  Synchro Material Monsters  for a  Negative Level . This potentially makes them much more difficult to Summon. So far, all of the Dark Tuner monsters that have appeared have 0  ATK  and  DEF , with the exception of " Dark Tuner Doom Submarine ", and are DARK. So far Dark Tuners have been  Fiend ,  Warrior ,  Insect ,  Beast ,  Spellcaster  and  Machine -Type. They also all seem to have a type of dark energy core somewhere in their card artwork.
 Currently, there are no Dark Tuner monsters in the  OCG  or  TCG , they only exist in the anime/manga and are playable in  Yu-Gi-Oh! 5D's Tag Force 4 ,  Yu-Gi-Oh! 5D's Tag Force 5  and  Yu-Gi-Oh! 5D's Tag Force 6 .
