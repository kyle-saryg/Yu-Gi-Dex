 This card can be  searched  by " Dark Sage ", " Ancient Gear Drill ", " Alchemic Magician ", " Angmarl the Fiendish Monarch ", " Left Arm Offering ", " Watch Dog ", " Watch Cat ", " Rogue of Endymion " and " The Despair Uranus ". 
 As with all  Unlimited  cards in the TCG/OCG, there is a 0.02% chance of opening all three copies of "7".
 Due to the lack of reliable ways to search  Continuous Spell Cards , and the specific requirement of playing all three copies in order to draw three cards, this card is unreliable as a  Deck thinner . 
 Use " Magical Hats " to search this card and " Z-ONE " during your opponent's Battle Phase - if "Z-ONE" is not attacked during that Battle Phase, its effect will activate, allowing you to retrieve this card from the Graveyard. 
 Make use of this card's LP gain, such as through " Fire Princess " and/or " Gryphon's Feather Duster ", so that you do not have to wait for all three copies of "7".
