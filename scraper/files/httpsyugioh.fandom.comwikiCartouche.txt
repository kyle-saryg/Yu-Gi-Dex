      Atem  holding his cartouche.     
 A  cartouche  is a rectangle-like figure with semi-circular ends used in Egyptian hieroglyphics to enclose a royal name.
 Téa Gardner  gave  Yami Yugi  a metallic cartouche neck chain, so he could write down his name when he remembered it.
 Yugi ,  Joey , Téa and  Tristan  later found Yami Yugi's real name, Atem, engraved on a wall. However they could not translate the hieroglyphics, [1]  but later they managed to copy the symbols as they remembered them on the metallic cartouche, enabling  Atem  to read his name. [2]
