 Booster 5  is a Japanese  Booster Pack  in the  Yu-Gi-Oh! Official Card Game  that was released on October 17, 1999. This set was sold only in  Carddass  vending machines. 
 Like other cards printed early on in the game, the cards have no printed set numbers, and lack the distinctive  Eye of Anubis Hologram  in the lower right-hand corner of each card.
 Of the 40 cards in  Booster 5 , all but 13—" 30,000-Year White Turtle ", " Aqua Snake ", " Beaked Snake ", " Crow Goblin ", " Fungi of the Musk ", " Korogashi ", " Krokodilus ", " Machine Attacker ", " Pot the Trick ", " Rainbow Marine Mermaid ", " Tentacle Plant ", " Turtle Raccoon ", and " Wing Eagle "—have since been printed in the  Yu-Gi-Oh! Trading Card Game .
