 Biography 
       Art before being brainwashed.     Art appeared after the  Duel  between the  Student Council President  and  Yuma Tsukumo . While Art was working on a comic in the library,  Girag  appeared before him and brainwashed him with a " Rank-Up-Magic Barian's Force " card. [1]  Later, Art appeared before Yuma and his friends and asked Yuma to be his model for his comic book series. Yuma accepted, and Art asked what his weakness was; Yuma responded that he didn't have any. Art also approached  Shark  with the same offer, but the latter refused. Art then met up with Girag, informing him that he found Shark's weakness, which was his sister,  Rio . He suggested they target Shark instead of Yuma, with Girag allowing it. Art kidnapped Rio, luring Shark into a Duel with him. Art was defeated by Shark, who utilized a combination of " Surging Erosion " and " Number C32: Shark Drake Veiss ". After the Duel, Art's brainwashing was erased, and he did not remember what he had done while he was brainwashed. The next day, Art showed his comics of Yuma and Shark to them. Once again, Shark was not impressed. Art showed Yuma a drawing of his character being crushed by a golem, with Shark's character fighting said monster. This left Yuma frustrated that he was put in this position. [2]
