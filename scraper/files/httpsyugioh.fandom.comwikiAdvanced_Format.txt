 In the  TCG , the  Advanced Format  is the official format used at  Regional ,  National , and  World Championship  Events. The Advanced Format includes the  Forbidden  List, the  Limited  List, and the  Semi-Limited  List.
 The  Forbidden  List was first created in the  TCG  in  October 2004 , to prevent cards from being used in tournaments that were either too powerful, had no drawbacks, or ended games too quickly. One of the most infamous  One Turn Kills / First Turn Kills  dealt with involved " Magical Scientist " and " Catapult Turtle ". Other overpowered  Deck  builds at the time, such as the " Last Turn " OTK and " Tsukuyomi "  Lockdown , have also been addressed in later Advanced Format revisions, with further lists tackling Goat Control and the Chaos Series.
 Following the inception of the Advanced Format, the  Traditional Format  was established, in which  Forbidden  cards are only  Limited . This gave players the option to continue playing with  Forbidden  cards.
 The  OCG  does not use the term "Advanced Format", though its official tournament format also includes all three lists. Prior to September 2013, the  TCG  and  OCG  official tournament lists were largely similar if not identical. Starting in September 2013, the lists for the two regions have dramatically diverged.
