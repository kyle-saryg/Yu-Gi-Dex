 Yu-Gi-Oh! ARC-V 
 In  episode 113 ,  Yuya Sakaki  uses this card during his rematch with  Iggy Arlo . After taking damage from the battle in which " Dark Rebellion Xyz Dragon " is destroyed, Yuya  Tributes  " Performapal Pyrobster " to activate this face-down card. Both players then draw two cards and reveal them. Yuya draws " Performapal Hip Hippo " and " Performapal Bit Bite Turtle ", while Iggy draws " Hayate the Earth Star " and " Tenma the Sky Star ". Because Iggy's drawn cards have a higher combined Level, Iggy takes 200 damage for each monster on the field and in either player's Graveyard, which is 1800, thus, he loses the duel. 
 In  episode 126 , this card was scattered on the floor around Yuya while he was trapped in  the Doktor 's cage. It is blown back into his hand, along with the rest of his deck, when Yuya  awakens .
