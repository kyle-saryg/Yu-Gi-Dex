 Biography 
         The henchman being used as the switch.     
 The henchman was in  Hirutani's gang , the first time Hirutani tried to get  Katsuya Jonouchi  to rejoin the gang. When Jonouchi turned on the gang, the henchman and two others restrained Jonouchi so they could take him to  the torture chamber . [1] [2] 
 At the torture chamber, Jonouchi had his hands tied behind his head and the henchman tried to shock him with a stun gun. However Jonouchi kicked him in the face, knocking him out. When  Dark Yugi  arrived he allowed himself to be beaten around, so he could secretly place a bar under the arm of the henchman, who was still unconscious and holding his stun gun. Dark Yugi lured the gang into a puddle and warned them that they were standing on a time bomb, that would go off if they did not find its switch. The switch was the henchman's suspended arm, holding the stun gun. As rainwater dripped onto his forehead, he woke up and dropped his stun gun into the puddle, electrocuting the gang. [2]
