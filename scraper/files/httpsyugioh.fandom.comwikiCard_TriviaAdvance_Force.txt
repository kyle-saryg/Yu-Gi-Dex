 " Vice Dragon " is featured on this card's artwork. It is being divided in two.
 This is fitting as "Vice Dragon" is a  Level  5 monster and likely is being Tributed for a Level 7 monster to be Summoned. Thus, this card visually demonstrates the card's effect. 
 This card's name refers to the fact that  Tribute Summons  are called "Advanced Summons" in the  OCG .
