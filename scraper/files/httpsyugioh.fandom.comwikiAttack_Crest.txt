Attack Crests  allow you to declare  attacks  in the game of  Dungeon Dice Monsters .
 Under normal conditions, you can declare a Normal  Attack  with 1 of your monsters in the  Dungeon  by spending 1 Attack Crest from your  Crest Pool . If you declare an attack through the effect of a monster or an item, you don't have to spends any Attack Crests.
 In addition, there are certain monsters whose effects will require you to pay Attack Crests for their activation (" Knight of Twin Swords ", for example).
 Monster Lords  are invulnerable to the effects of all monsters and items in play, which means that they can only be destroyed in Battle. When you don't have any Attack Crests in your Crest Pool, you're completely unable to defeat your opponent.
