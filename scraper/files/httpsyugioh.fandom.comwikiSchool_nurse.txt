 Ridley Sheldon  controlled a puppet, identical in appearance to the nurse, fooling  Yugi Mutou  into believing he was speaking with the actual nurse. The nurse puppet defeated Yugi in a game of  Duel Monsters , winning with the help of  Aphrodite . As punishment for losing, she took the  Neon Knight  card from Yugi. After the Duel, Ridley Sheldon discarded the puppet to comment on Yugi's lack of strategy and tactics. [1] 
 The real school nurse treated  Anzu Mazaki ,  Katsuya Jonouchi  and  Hiroto Honda  when they were poisoned by  Warashibe . [2]
