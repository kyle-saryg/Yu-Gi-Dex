 This card's Arabic name (السيّاف الحارس العنيد) translates to  Stubborn Guard Swordsman . 
 In the Arabic anime dub, specifically in the  Virtual World  Arc, this card was among a few at that time that were given erroneous names due to overusing transliteration even when inapplicable. This card was called (السيّاف أبنوكشوس)  "Obnoxious" the Swordsman . 
 In the German dub of the anime, this card was called "Abscheulicher Elfenschwertkämpfer" (" Obnoxious Elf Swordsman "). The official TCG name "Ausgebildeter Keltischer Wächter" instead translates to " Trained Celtic Guardian ". Due to the card not being part of the Guardian archetype, the name was later changed to "Ausgebildeter Keltischer Wärter". 
 The  Greek  name given translates to " Wild Celtic Swordsman ", a card name offered by the official Greek dub of the anime. 
 This card's Portuguese name has only ever been printed as " Guarda Celta Re-treinado ". However, the  Yu-Gi-Oh! TRADING CARD GAME: Updated Card Names - Portuguese  document specifies that this card was renamed from " Guardião Celta Re-treinado " to " Guarda Celta Re-treinado ", despite it never being printed under the former name and having already been printed under the latter name.
