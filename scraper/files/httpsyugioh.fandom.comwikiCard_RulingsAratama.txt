 Spirit monster Rulings 
 OCG Rulings 
 " Cannot be  Special Summoned " is not treated as a monster effect. [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] 
 The effect " During the  End Phase  of the  turn  this card is  Normal Summoned  or  flipped   face-up :  Return  it to the  hand . " is a  Trigger Effect  that activates once during the End Phase this card was Normal Summoned or flipped face-up. (It does not target.) [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] 
 This effect is not activated during the End Phase if this card was changed to face-down Defense Position by the effect of " Book of Moon ", or if this card was sent to the Graveyard because it was destroyed by battle or card effect. [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] 
 The negating effect of " Alector, Sovereign of Birds " does not end during the  End Phase . The effects of the  targeted  card remains negated during the entire turn. [19] 
 Example: The effects of  Spirit monsters , " Majestic Mech - Goryu ", and " Jain, Lightsworn Paladin " will activate during the End Phase, but they will be negated and resolve without effect. 
 Previously Official Rulings 
   These TCG rulings were issued by  Upper Deck Entertainment  and have since been deemed unofficial by Konami. [20]  They were previously considered official, but may or may not necessarily hold true nowadays. 
 
 The following rules apply to all  Spirit monsters : [21] 
 Spirit  is not a  monster Type ; you cannot declare "Spirit" for the effect of " DNA Surgery ". [21] 
 Spirit monsters are still  Effect Monsters . [21] 
 A  Spirit monster  must be  face-up  on the field during the  End Phase  for it to return to the owner’s hand. If it was destroyed or removed from play, it will not return to the owner’s hand. [21] 
 A  Spirit monster  will return to the owner’s hand during the  End Phase , even if the opponent played it from their hand (through the effect of " Exchange ".) [21]
