Due to Sartorius' sinister assaults and psychological warfare, Aster begins to lose his resolve.  The Light,  says the real  Sartorius  is gone and his body is simply a host for it. He then attempts to take the  key,  but then Aster begins to fight back after the Real Sartorius begins to support him. After in turn helping give his friend the confidence to fight back against the Light of Destruction, Aster makes a dramatic turnaround and attempts to win the Duel with " Destiny Hero - Plasma ", but is ultimately defeated as  The Light of Destruction    unleashes " Arcana Force EX - The Light Ruler ".

 Sartorius has 3500 Life Points remaining and controls "Arcana Force XXI - The World" (3100/3100) in Attack Position. He also controls one set card.
 Turn 7: Aster 
Aster draws " Doctor D " and subsequently activates it to  remove from play  " Destiny Hero - Defender " from his  Graveyard  and  Special Summon  " Destiny Hero - Disk Commander " from his Graveyard (300/300) in Defense Position. Since "Disk Commander" was  Special Summoned from Aster's Graveyard , its effect activates, allowing Aster to draw two cards (one of which " Destiny Hero - Doom Lord "). 
 Aster then Normal Summons "Destiny Hero - Doom Lord" (600/800) in  Defense Position . He then activates the effect of "Doom Lord" to remove  Sartorius ' " Arcana Force XXI - The World " from play for two turns at the cost of not being allowed to attack this turn. [Notes 1]  Aster then activates " D - Formation ". Now if a " Destiny Hero " monster on Aster's side of the field is destroyed, Aster can place a  D Counter  on "D - Formation".

Due to the last effect of "Necro Sacrifice", Sartorius can Normal Summon the targeted monster without Tributing this turn. Since "The Empress" and "The Emperor" were summoned, they begin to rotate. Both monsters land upside down, so if Sartorius summons a monster, Aster has to send one card from his hand to the Graveyard (Tails effect of "The Empress") and all Arcana Force monsters on Aster's side of the field lose 500 ATK (Tails effect of "The Emperor") ("Arcana Force III - The Empress": 1300 → 800/1300; "Arcana Force IV - The Emperor": 1400 → 900/1400). 
 Sartorius then Normal Summons " Arcana Force XV - The Fiend " without Tributing (2500/2500) in Attack Position. Since "The Fiend" was summoned, it begins to rotate.

 Turn 10: Sartorius 
Sartorius draws " Reverse Reborn " and subsequently activates it to Special Summon "Arcana Force XV - The Fiend" (2500/2500) from his Graveyard in Attack Position with its Tails effect automatically applied. Due to the Tails effect of "The Fiend", when it attacks, all monsters on the field will be destroyed. "The Fiend" attacks "Dasher". Sartorius then activates the Tails effect of "The Fiend" to destroy all monsters on the field. "D - Formation" then gains a second D Counter. Sartorius then Sets a card.
 Turn 11: Aster 
Aster draws. On Aster's Standby Phase, "Arcana Force XXI - The World" is returned to Sartorius' side of the field (3100/3100) in Attack Position due to the effect of "Doom Lord". Aster then Normal Summons " D3 " (0/0) in  Attack Position . Since Aster summoned a monster. he activates the second effect of "D - Formation", sending the latter card to the Graveyard in order to add 2 copies of "D3" from his  Deck  to his hand. Aster then activates the effect of "D3", sending the two copies of "D3" in his hand to the Graveyard in order to treat the "D3" on the field as three  Tributes  for the summon of a Destiny Hero monster. 
 Aster then  Tributes  "D3" in order to  Special Summon  " Destiny Hero - Plasma " (1900/600) in  Attack Position . He then activates the effect of "Destiny Hero - Plasma", equipping itself with "Arcana Force XXI - The World", increasing its ATK by half the ATK of "The World", and gaining all the effects of "The World" ("Plasma": 1900 → 3450/600).
