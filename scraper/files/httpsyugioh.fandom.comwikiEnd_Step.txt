       Order of a  turn .     
 The  End Step  (Japanese: エンドステップ  Endo Suteppu ) is the last step in the  Battle Phase . It is also commonly referred to in card effects as "the end of the Battle Phase". [1] 
 The End Step is traditionally entered from the  Battle Step , although card effects may force it to be entered from the  Start Step  instead (such as those of " Electromagnetic Turtle " and " Scrubbed Raid "). If the Battle Phase is skipped to another  phase  due to a card effect like " Flashbang " or " Neko Mane King ", the End Step is never entered. [2] [3] 
 
 Breakdown of the End Step 
 Fast effects  and appropriate  Trigger / Trigger-like Effects  may be activated here, such as the effects of " Ancient Forest ", " Gladiator Beast " monsters, and " Skull Conductor ", as per the rules of  fast effect timing . [4] 
 Cards that would force an extra  battle  and make that battle proceed to  damage calculation , such as " Equip Shot ", cannot be activated by this point. [5] 
 Cards/effects that would negate a future attack, such as " Necro Gardna " and " Hero Barrier ", cannot be activated by this point. [6] 
 Cards/effects that would end the  Battle Phase  (making the Battle Phase proceed to the End Step) [7] , such as " Black Cat-astrophe " and " Electromagnetic Turtle ", cannot be activated by this point. [8]
