 Ultra Rare  (Japanese:  ＵＲ   Urutora Rea , or simply  Ultra ) cards are identified by having a gold card name and a holofoil image. Starting with the TCG set Battles of Legend: Light's Revenge released in July of 2017, the  Level / Rank  and  Attribute  of the card are also holofoil.
 The card name can also be red, but these are only available in Japanese promos. The odds of getting an Ultra Rare in a Booster Pack was around 1:12 in Booster Packs before  Soul of the Duelist . From  Soul of the Duelist  onwards, the odds became around 1:24. Reprint sets released after  Soul of the Duelist  such as  Dark Revelation Volume 3  use the 1:12 ratio. After  Tactical Evolution  the odds dropped back down to 1:12. In the oldest  OCG  packs, such as the first  Premium Pack , almost all cards are Ultra Rare. 
 In earlier pre-constructed decks, both  Starter  and  Structure Decks , there is one card (except  Structure Deck: Dragonic Legion / Dragons Collide Structure Deck  which contains two) printed in Ultra Rare. Later Structure Decks, such as  Structure Deck: Master of Pendulum / Master of Pendulum Structure Deck , have more than 1. These are usually the featured cards of the deck and the highlight of their collection. However, these cards are always predetermined, so it's entirely for appearance and not rarity.
 The chance of getting Ultra Rare cards in  Duelist Packs  is 1:12. The chance of getting Ultra Rares in  Booster Packs  was originally 1:24, although this was changed to 1:12 later on. In 2016 this ratio was once again changed to 1:6.
 Ultra Rare cards are often more valuable than other cards, because they are harder to find and usually more useful.

 Example 
 
 Other games 
 In  Yu-Gi-Oh! BAM , Ultra Rare cards and are identified by   ( Series 1 ),   ( Series 2 ) or   ( Side Series ). These cards have a cost of over   250 or ranging from 5 to 29  .
 After the new shop update on August 8, 2013, these cards have a cost of   2 to 22. 
 In  Yu-Gi-Oh! Duel Arena , cards that are  Secret Rare  are displayed and counted as Ultra Rare cards, with seemingly the same "pull rates" as other Ultra Rare cards.
