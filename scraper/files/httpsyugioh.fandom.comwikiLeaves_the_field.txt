       " Reborn Tengu ", a card whose effect activates when it leaves the field     
 Leaves the field  (Japanese: フィールドから 離 れた  fīrudo kara hanareta , lit. "removed from the field"), formerly known as  removed from the field  (Japanese: フィールド 上 から 離 れた  fīrudo-jō kara hanareta , lit. "removed from the field"), refers to when a card is moved from the  field  to a different place.
 
 Rulings 
 When a card on the field is moved into the  Main Deck , that card cannot  activate  its "leaves the field"  effect . [1] [2]  However, any effects or conditions that card has that apply when it "leaves the field" that do not use a  Chain  will still be applied. [3] 
 Cards on the field that have become  Xyz Materials  are not considered to "leave the field", even though they are no longer treated as cards on the field after that, thus, cannot activate their "leaves the field" effect. [4] [5] 
 If a  Token Monster  would leave the field, it simply disappears, but it is still considered to leave the field.
 If a card is  banished face-down , it cannot activate its "leaves the field" effect.
 If a card or effect can be activated when another card(s) leaves the field, it can be activated even if the card that left the field is shuffled into the  Main Deck .
 While uncommon, some cards and effects do describe a card leaving a particular  zone  (e.g. "leaves your Monster Zone or Pendulum Zone").
