 Summary 
 Joey has a nightmare about  Seto Kaiba  and his  Blue-Eyes White Dragon , who tells him he is a coward and becomes a dog. The next morning  Téa  shows up with  Mai 's backpack. Mai left the group, but wrote  Yugi  a note saying she owes him eight  Star Chips . 
 As the gang walk through the woods, they are being spied on by three boys,  Bonz ,  Sid , and  Zygor , who all work for  Bandit Keith . Keith is in the Duelist Kingdom tournament to get revenge on Pegasus for what he did to him in New York City. They know Yugi was the kid who defeated Seto Kaiba months earlier, so they decide to eliminate Joey first. Joey, feeling that he's being stalked (he has to go to the bathroom in the original Japanese), runs away from the group but Sid and Zygor secretly follow him. 
 Meanwhile, Keith and Bonz enter a cave where a Graveyard field is located. This is where Bonz plans to duel Joey, and he will do so with Keith's help in the form of advice and extra monsters in his Deck. Joey turns around to see Zygor, who knocks him unconscious. He wakes up in the cave and is forced to duel Bonz, putting all four of his Star Chips on the line. Yugi and the group start to worry about Joey and split up to look for him. 
 
In the duel, Bonz draws " Call of the Haunted " and activates it. The trap's effect  Special Summons  all of Bonz's monsters from his  Graveyard  and turns them into Zombie-Type monsters.       Bonz 's monsters revived as Zombies.     
 Yugi and the group find Joey's wallet, leading them to investigate a nearby cave.

 Errors 
 In the dub, just before Bonz activates "Call of the Haunted" he erroneously labels it as a Magic Card ("You're finished, this  Magic  Card is unstoppable!"); this is a probable allusion to said card being a Spell in the Japanese version 
 In the Japanese, when Crass Clown is played, its card has no Level. 
 Trivia 
 In  Yu-Gi-Oh! Legacy of the Duelist  and it's remake, Zygor and Sid's lines were added to Bonz's dialogue boxes.
