 Major Events 
 This is a  Shadow Game  played between  Yami Yugi  and  Yami Marik . As each player's  Life Points  decrease, their respective hosts ( Yugi Muto  and  Marik Ishtar ) will have more and more of their body wiped out. 
 When a player loses, both spirit and host will cease to exist (be sent to the  Shadow Realm  in the dub). However, Yami Marik would not be affected if he lost, since he was an alter ego that Marik created himself, whereas Yami Yugi is a completely different spirit living dependably inside Yugi's body with Yugi's own spirit. 
 Before the match begins,  Kaiba  gives Yugi a card which will help him win the duel, " Fiend's Sanctuary ". 
 Featured Duel: Yami Marik vs. Yami Yugi - Part 1 
 Turn 1: Yami Marik 
Yami Marik draws " Vampiric Leech " and subsequently Normal Summons it (500/1200) in Attack Position. "Vampiric Leech" then  attacks   directly  via its own effect ( Yugi  4000 → 3500). Yami Marik then  activates  " Vampiric Leech 's second effect,  discarding  " The Winged Dragon of Ra " to switch "Vampiric Leech" to  Defense Position . Yami Marik's hand is shown to contain " Dark Spell Regeneration ", " Juragedo ", " Zombie's Jewel ", and " Vengeful Bog Spirit ". Yami Marik  Sets  a card.
 Turn 2: Yami Yugi 
Yami Yugi draws "Exchange". He then Normal Summons " Queen's Knight " (1500/1600) in Attack Position. "Queen's Knight" attacks and  destroys  "Vampiric Leech". Yami Yugi Sets two cards.
 Turn 3: Yami Marik 
Yami Marik draws. He then Normal Summons " Juragedo " (1700/1300) in Attack Position. "Juragedo" attacks and destroys "Queen's Knight" ( Yugi  3500 → 3300). Yami Marik then Sets two cards.
 Turn 4: Yami Yugi 
Yami Yugi draws. Yami Marik then activates his face-down " Left Arm Offering " to discard his entire  hand  and add " Monster Reborn " from his  Deck  to his hand. Yami Yugi then activates his face-down " Exchange " to force both players to take one card from their opponent's hand; Yami Yugi takes "Monster Reborn" from Marik's hand while Yami Marik takes "  De-Fusion " from Yami Yugi's hand. (Other cards that were shown in Yugi's hand at this point include " King's Knight ", " Kuriboh ", and " Ragnarok ".)
 Yami Yugi then activates "Monster Reborn" to revive "Queen's Knight" (1500/1600) in Attack Position. Yami Yugi then Normal Summons "King's Knight" (1600/1400) in Attack Position. Since "Queen's Knight was on the field when "King's Knight" was summoned, the effect of "King's Knight" activates, allowing Yami Yugi to  Special Summon  " Jack's Knight " (1900/1000) in Attack Position.
 Turn 5: Yami Marik 
Yami Marik draws. He then Sets a card (Yugi's "De-Fusion"). Yami Marik then activates " Card of Sanctity " to make him and Yugi  draw  until they both have six cards in their  hand  (Yami Marik draws six cards, while Yami Yugi draws four cards). Yami Marik then switches "Juragedo" to  Defense Position .
 Turn 6: Yami Yugi 
Yami Yugi draws "Slifer the Sky Dragon". Aside from "Slifer", Yami Yugi's hand contains "Ragnarok", "Kuriboh", " Dark Magician Girl ", " Gazelle the King of Mythical Beasts ", " Magical Dimension ", and " Dark Magician ". Yami Yugi then  Tributes  "Queen's Knight", "King's Knight" and "Jack's Knight" in order to Tribute Summon " Slifer the Sky Dragon " (X000/X000) in Attack Position. Due to the effect of of "Slifer", it gains 1000 ATK and DEF for each card in Yami Yugi's hand. He currently has six ("Slifer the Sky Dragon": 0 → 6000/0 → 6000). 
 "Slifer" attacks "Juragedo", but Marik activates his face-down " Dark Spell Regeneration " to activate the "Monster Reborn" from Yugi's  Graveyard  as his card, allowing Marik to revive "The Winged Dragon of Ra" (?/?) in Defense Position. Yami Marik then transforms "The Winged Dragon of Ra" into  Egyptian God Phoenix  (0/0).
 Duel continues next episode. 
 
 Trivia 
 While not outright stated, Yami Marik is cheating with his rules. Despite the fact the Yugi is not in control of his body and is a spirit at the time, if the Pharaoh loses, Yugi's body gets destroyed as well. 
 Differences In Adaptations 
 The card " Winged Dragon of Ra " is added over the close up of " Fiend's Sanctuary " in the US version. 
 Cut from the US version are shots of  Yami Marik  sticking his tongue out (except for one incident during which Yami Marik mocks Yami Yugi while explaining the nature of his Shadow Game). 
 A shot of Yami Marik holding a card with his teeth is removed from the US version. 
 In Turn 6, the cards in Yugi's hand are different. In the US version, aside from "Slifer", his hand contains " Fiend's Sanctuary ", " Jack's Knight ", " King's Knight ", " Queen's Knight ", " Multiply ", and " Dark Magician ".
 In the case of "Fiend's Sanctuary", this can be considered an error since Yugi draws and immediately sets "Fiend's Sanctuary" later in the duel  in the next episode .
