 Summary 
 Yusei  has just returned to the city with " Shooting Quasar Dragon " as he Duels  Z-one . He tells Z-one that this is Team 5D's final stage and the proof of their evolution.  Crow  says that Yusei has done it and Summoned the ultimate  Synchro Monster  using five Synchro Monsters.  Jack  says that it is proof of Yusei's evolution.  Luna  and  Leo  add that it is all of their power's combined form.  Akiza  finishes by saying "Shooting Quasar Dragon".  Z-one  is astonished as  Limit Over Accel Synchro  never existed in the history that he came from. Yusei vows to protect the people important to him and the  city  he was born in and gets ready to continue the Duel.
 Z-one reminds Yusei that the " Timelord " monsters cannot be destroyed and he takes no  Battle Damage , so regardless of how many monsters Yusei Summons, he cannot defeat the "Timelord" monsters. Yusei disagrees, and informs Z-one that the effects of "Shooting Quasar Dragon" can nullify the "Timelords" and also let it  attack  once for each  Synchro Material Monster  used to Summon it. (Specifically, "Quasar" can  negate  a negation effect when it battles, so it can negate the "Timelords'" effects that negate their destruction in battle; "Quasar" also negates all effect damage and is unaffected by monster effects.) With this, Jack says that the "Timelord" monsters can be defeated. Akiza notes that "Shooting Quasar Dragon" has five attacks and Crow says that their bonds shall give Yusei strength.
 
       The five orbs around " Shooting Quasar Dragon ".     
 Five orbs appears around "Shooting Quasar Dragon", each representing one of its Synchro Material.  Team 5D's  cheers on "Shooting Quasar Dragon" to use the team's combined power and use its " The Creation Burst " attack on the "Timelord" monsters. Four of the orbs take on the forms of " Red Dragon Archfiend ", " Black Rose Dragon ", " Black-Winged Dragon " and " Ancient Fairy Dragon " and attack and destroy " Michion ", " Hailon ", " Raphion " and " Gabrion ".
 
       "Shooting Quasar Dragon" battles " Sandaion ".     
 Leo points out that only " Sandaion " is left and it has the same  ATK  as "Shooting Quasar Dragon". Leo and Yusei declare the attack together and "Shooting Quasar Dragon" launches its last orb, which represents " Life Stream Dragon ", at "Sandaion". "Sandaion" fights back with an equally strong blast. The two attacks collide, causing an explosion and destroying both monsters.
 Z-one is annoyed to see the "Timelord" monsters annihilated, but says that the attack was suicide since Yusei's monster has also been destroyed. However he looks up and sees the smoke clear, revealing " Shooting Star Dragon " on Yusei's field. Yusei explains that when "Shooting Quasar Dragon" is destroyed, he can Special Summon "Shooting Star Dragon" in its place.
 Yusei uses "Shooting Star Dragon" to attack Z-one directly with its "Stardust Mirage" attack. Z-one's  Life Points  drop to 700 and he is knocked off course, sending him spinning into a building. Down below,  Lazar ,  Elsworth  and the  MC  dash away to avoid being hit by falling debris from the impact. The MC starts to congratulate Yusei's counterattack and tells Z-one that this is Yusei's strength, but then corrects himself calling it Team 5D's strength. The citizens all cheer and the MC pleads for Yusei to win for everyone's sake.
 
       Yusei  finds  Z-one  crashed into the building.     
 Yusei flies over to where Z-one has crashed and says that he is using the effect of " Speed World 2 ". He removes seven  Speed Counters  to draw a card. Something strikes him after seeing what the card is. He then  Sets  it in his  Spell & Trap Card Zone  and ends his turn.
 Z-one says that he is the last human and in order to save the future he has endured long suffering. For that, he claims to have the right to change history. Yusei argues that he doesn't and nobody has that right. Z-one then asks if Yusei is denying his existence. Yusei replies that if the future is how Z-one has described it to be then maybe despair is waiting for them, but even to save the world nobody has the right to take away people's futures. He says that the possibility of saving the future lies in the hands of living people and asks why Z-one is not trying to believe in that.
 
         The tree formed by " Infinite Light ".     
 Z-one replies that he no longer has time to do that. He then opens his eye and shoots a blast of white light out of the building where he crashed. Z-one flies along the white path and stops in front of Yusei. He announces that he shall show that the possibility Yusei is talking about is pointless in front of him.
 
         The Kabbalah tree with the " Timelord " monsters.     
 Z-one begins his turn. His SPC goes up to 8 and Yusei's goes up to 1. The three rings from " Infinite Light " line up and create a blue beam passing through them. Strong winds kick-up around it and lightning strikes. Spikes start to protrude from the blue beam and Z-one tells Yusei to watch closely as this is his true power. The blue beam now takes the form of a tree. On its branches and roots are ten circles. Z-one explains that "Infinite Light" has another effect that can be activated after ten different "Timelord" monsters have been  Normal  or  Special Summoned . The tree now appears as the  Kabbalah  tree diagram and the god cards start appearing in the ten circles, which are each numbered and Z-one  chants   "Within the light of freedom where the Temporal Machine Gods were born there is a hidden  Da'at  where only the chosen ones can venture. The source of nothingness and existence, the ultimate Timelord that was born from infinite light" , as " Sephylon, the Ultimate Timelord " appears in an eleventh circle and is Summoned with 4000 ATK.
 
         " Sephylon, the Ultimate Timelord " is Summoned.     
 Z-one activates the effect of "Sephylon" to Special Summon as many "Timelord" monsters as possible and make their ATK 4000. He uses it to Special Summon " Metaion ",  Sadion ", "Gabrion" and "Sandaion". The five "Timelord" monsters now surround Yusei and Z-one explains that "Sephylon" also gains ATK equal to all his other "Timelord" monsters, brining it up to 20000. Jack says that the other gods even have 4000 ATK, which is more than "Shooting Star Dragon" and  Sherry  believes that the situation is now way worse than before.
 
         "Sephylon" attacks "Shooting Star Dragon" with " Akashic Storm ".     
 Z-one states the long battle they have had is now coming to its end and with this the world shall be saved through the destruction of New Domino City. Z-one gets "Sephylon" to attack "Shooting Star Dragon" with its "Akashic Storm" attack, and it's effect negates the effects of "Shooting Star Dragon", so it cannot negate the attack. Team 5D's and Sherry anxiously call Yusei's name. Z-one bids farewell to Yusei and tells him to disappear.
 Yusei emerges from the attack okay and claims to have not given up on his future yet. He reveals his  Trap Card , " Converging Wishes ". When "Shooting Star Dragon" is destroyed by battle, it reduces the damage to 0 and lets him  Synchro Summon  " Stardust Dragon " by removing appropriate  Synchro Material  in his  Graveyard  from play. He tunes " Power Tool Dragon " with " Turbo Synchron " and chants  "Gathering wishes will become a new shining star. Become the path its light shines upon. Synchro Summon! Take Flight, Stardust Dragon"  as he Synchro Summons "Stardust Dragon".
 Z-one asks just what Yusei is trying to do; "Stardust Dragon" has but 2500 ATK, while he has four "Timelord" monsters with 4000 ATK and "Sephylon, the Ultimate Timelord" with 20000 ATK. Yusei replies that "Stardust Dragon" is the combined form of Team 5D's and the citizens' wishes. He then explains another effect of "Converging Wishes"; "Stardust Dragon" gains ATK equal to that of that of all  Dragon - Type  Synchro Monsters in his Graveyard. He currently has seven: "Shooting Star Dragon", "Shooting Quasar Dragon", "Life Stream Dragon", "Red Dragon Archfiend", "Black-Winged Dragon", "Ancient Fairy Dragon" and "Black Rose Dragon". An orb representing each of the dragons travels from Yusei's Graveyard into "Stardust Dragon" causing it to grow and increasing its ATK to 23000.
 
         The "Timelord" monsters form a shield.     
 Finally Yusei activates the last effect of "Converging Wishes". By returning Synchro Monsters from his Graveyard to his Extra Deck, he can force an opponent's monster to attack. He chooses "Sephylon, the Ultimate Timelord". Since Yusei only controls "Stardust Dragon", "Sephylon" will have to attack it. Z-one reveals that by removing the other "Timelord" monsters from play, Z-one can prevent "Sephylon" from being destroyed and him from taking Battle Damage. The "Timelord" monsters all form a shield in front of "Sephylon".
 First, Yusei returns "Ancient Fairy Dragon" to his Extra Deck, forcing "Sephylon" to attack "Stardust Dragon". "Stardust Dragon" is stronger and so counterattacks, forming an image of "Ancient Fairy Dragon" to remove the "Metaion" portion of the shield. With "Ancient Fairy Dragon" and "Metaion" gone, the ATKs of "Stardust Dragon" and "Sephylon" drop to 20900 and 16000 respectively. Next, Yusei returns "Life Stream Dragon", taking out the "Sadion" portion of the shield and dropping the monsters' ATK to 18000 and 12000. Yusei returns "Black Rose Dragon" and takes out the "Gabrion" portion, dropping their ATK to 15600 and 8000. He returns "Black-Winged Dragon" to take out the "Sandaion" portion, dropping their ATK to 12800 and 4000. Lastly Yusei removes "Red Dragon Archfiend" and the "Sephylon" portion of the shield is taken out. "Stardust Dragon" continues its counterattack with 9800 ATK.
 Yusei says that this is his last attack and thinks of everyone relying on him, including  his father , Jack, Crow, Akiza, Luna, Leo, Sherry, Elsworth, Lazar, the MC,  Trudge ,  Mina ,  Dragan ,  Broder ,  Halldor ,  Kaz , other  Securities ,  Carly , the  Cafe la Geen owner ,  Stephanie ,  Martha ,  Blister ,  Atsuko ,  Kaoru ,  Mitch ,  Taka ,  John ,  Hikari ,  Kokoro ,  Taiga ,  Ginga ,  Daichi ,  Lyndon ,  Zora ,  Nervin ,  Rally ,  Tank ,  Blitz ,  Yanagi ,  Tanner ,  Larry ,  Lenny ,  Lug ,  Hunter ,  Dexter ,  Greiger ,  Setsuko ,  Hideo ,  Kalin ,  Misty ,  Roman ,  Rex ,  Sly ,  Patty ,  Bob ,  Heitmann ,  Nico ,  West ,  Bolten ,  Rick ,  Breo ,  Andre ,  Jean ,  Max ,  Annie ,  Yoshizo ,  Jinbei ,  Taro ,  Aporia ,  Paradox  and  Bruno .
 
         Energy from around the world joins with "Stardust Dragon".     
 Yusei tells Z-one to take on their future. Beams of energy from all over the planet travel towards "Stardust Dragon" and Yusei says that their wishes shall become the path that lights up the future. Using that energy, "Stardust Dragon" launches a powerful "Shooting Sonic" at "Sephylon", destroying it and many of Z-one's mechanical parts. Z-one says that it is impossible for him to lose as his Life Points drop to 0. The remaining portion of his mask breaks away and parts of him explode.
 The MC announces that after the miraculous Duel and miraculous reversal the one who will lead New Domino City to the future is their hero, Yusei Fudo. Everyone cheers and Yusei spots Z-one falling through the sky. He then remembers Bruno saying that he wants him to save the world and save Z-one.
 
         Team 5D's  and  Sherry  fall from the Divine Temple.     
 The Ener-D in the Divine Temple goes out and it stops moving downwards. However the buildings on it start to break off and fall towards the city. Team 5D's and Sherry run to their Duel Runners to try and get to safety, but the ground below them collapses and they start to fall. However the  Crimson Dragon  suddenly appears.
 
         Yusei aids Z-one.     
 Yusei lands his Duel Runner where Z-one has crash landed and rushes over to Z-one, asking if he is okay. He tries to help Z-one, but is told by Z-one that it is no use as the device that prolongs Z-one's life will soon shut down. He tells Yusei that it is okay since his life was already at its limit and the truth is that he wanted the future that Yusei was going to change, but no longer had the time to do that. Z-one's mouth starts to bleed, so Yusei tells him not to talk. Z-one says that he was lonely, but by remembering the bonds that he had with his comrades;  Paradox ,  Aporia  and  Antinomy , he tried to fight alone. He asks Yusei if the things  he did were wrong. Yusei shakes his head and replies that all Z-one was doing was trying to open up his own future and now the warnings that he gave out have been inscribed in people's hearts and as long as they don't forget them, the future will change. In the final moment of his life, Z-one says that he was able to watch Yusei open a new future. He believes that Yusei can lead the people to this future.
 After feeling a tremor from the Divine Temple, Yusei says that he has one more thing to do and Z-one asks if he is planning on dying. In order to make the Divine Temple rise back up, Yusei explains that he must attach an Ener-D rotating in a positive direction and states that is his final role to the city. Z-one closes his eye and Yusei flies to the top of the Divine Temple, where he previously entered it.
 
         The  Crimson Dragon  after rescuing Team 5D's and Sherry.     
 Team 5D's and Sherry are transported to the outskirts of the city and realize that they were saved by the Crimson Dragon. Sherry points out that the Divine Temple has stopped and Akiza realizes that Yusei is still inside it. Sherry worries that the future where Yusei dies may not have changed. Akiza notes that is impossible and Jack adds that Z-one's defeat should have changed that future. Leo realizes that this is terrible. He and Luna then yell out to Yusei.
 
         Yusei flies towards the Ener-D reactor.     
 Inside the Divine Temple, Yusei flies through a chute towards the old Ener-D reactor. Z-one suddenly breaks through a wall and joins him. Z-one explains that inside his body, he is equipped with the same Ener-D Yusei has and will insert it into the negative rotating Ener-D. He says that Yusei has been entrusted with a new future and must live on. He grabs Yusei with one of his large hands and throws him back up the chute. Z-one smashes into the Ener-D reactor and tells Aporia, Antinomy and Paradox that he shall soon be with them as he is enveloped by the Ener-D.
 
         Z-one dies, saying he will join  Aporia ,  Antinomy  and  Paradox .     
 The Ener-D on the Divine Temple lights up and it starts to lift upwards away from the city. Yusei continues his flight out of the Divine Temple now dodging loose chunks which have fallen down the chute. Soon the falling debris start to close in on Yusei, so he utilizes all of his strength to make his Duel Runner go faster and dodge the debris.
 
         The Divine Temple disappearing.     
 On the outskirts of the city, Team 5D's notice that the Divine Temple is disappearing and worry that Yusei might be going with it. The Temple finally disappears and the sky brightens-up. Leo and Luna begin to cry, thinking that Yusei is gone. Crow and Jack are stunned and Sherry hangs her head. Akiza's eyes start to fill up with tears, but she suddenly notices a figure flying out of the sunlight and wonders what it is. When the figure gets closer, she then notices that it's Yusei and becomes overjoyed that he is okay. Leo and Luna notice this too and become happy that Yusei survived. They then call out and wave to him. Jack is glad that he is okay and Crow notes that Yusei had them all worried. Crow and Jack then share a fist pound. Akiza says "Welcome back!" to Yusei as he approaches. Yusei flies down to his friends and tells them that he has come back.
 
 
 Featured Duel: Z-one vs. Yusei Fudo 
 ... continued from the previous episode 
 Turn 8: Yusei 
Yusei has just  Limit Over Accel Synchro Summoned  " Shooting Quasar Dragon ". Its first effect allows it to attack once for each  Synchro Monster  used for its Synchro Summon. Since Yusei used five Synchro Monsters, "Shooting Quasar Dragon" can attack five times. "Shooting Quasar Dragon" also has a second, third, and fourth effect: When it attacks, it can negate an effect that negates until the end of the Battle Phase; it prevents all effect damage to Yusei; and it is unaffected by his opponent's monster effects.
 "Shooting Quasar Dragon" attacks " Michion, the Timelord ". The third effect of "Michion" activates, which would inflict damage to Yusei equal to half of his  Life Points , but the third effect of "Shooting Quasar Dragon" prevents all effect damage. The first effect of "Michion" would negate its destruction by battle, but the second effect of "Shooting Quasar Dragon" negates that effect. "Michion" is destroyed, but its second effect reduces the battle damage that Z-one would have taken to 0.
 "Shooting Quasar Dragon" attacks " Hailon, the Timelord ". The third effect of "Hailon" activates, which would inflict damage to Yusei equal to the difference between his and Z-one's  Life Points  (currently 2000), but the third effect of "Shooting Quasar Dragon" prevents all effect damage. The first effect of "Hailon" would negate its destruction by battle, but the second effect of "Shooting Quasar Dragon" negates that effect. "Hailon" is destroyed, but its second effect reduces the battle damage that Z-one would have taken to 0.
 "Shooting Quasar Dragon" attacks " Raphion, the Timelord ". The third effect of "Raphion" activates, which would return "Shooting Quasar Dragon" back to Yusei's Extra Deck and inflict damage to Yusei equal to the ATK of "Shooting Quasar Dragon" (4000), but the third effect of "Shooting Quasar Dragon" prevents all effect damage and its fourth effect makes it immune to the effects of "Raphion". The first effect of "Raphion" would negate its destruction by battle, but the second effect of "Shooting Quasar Dragon" negates that effect. "Raphion" is destroyed, but its second effect reduces the battle damage that Z-one would have taken to 0.
 "Shooting Quasar Dragon" attacks " Gabrion, the Timelord ". The third effect of "Gabrion" activates, which would return all cards Yusei controls to his Deck, but the fourth effect of "Shooting Quasar Dragon" makes it immune to the effects of "Gabrion" (and Yusei controls no cards other than "Shooting Quasar Dragon" to be returned). The first effect of "Gabrion" would negate its destruction by battle, but the second effect of "Shooting Quasar Dragon" negates that effect. "Gabrion" is destroyed, but its second effect reduces the battle damage that Z-one would have taken to 0.
 Finally, "Shooting Quasar Dragon" attacks " Sandaion, the Timelord ". The third effect of "Sandaion" activates, which would inflict 4000 damage to Yusei, but the third effect of "Shooting Quasar Dragon" prevents all effect damage. The first effect of "Sandaion" would negate its destruction by battle, but the second effect of "Shooting Quasar Dragon" negates that effect. "Shooting Quasar Dragon" and "Sandaion" destroy each other in a  Double KO . 
 Since "Shooting Quasar Dragon" was removed from the field, its final effect activates, destroying all monsters on the field (there are none) and Special Summoning " Shooting Star Dragon " ( 10/3300/2500) from Yusei's Extra Deck in Attack Position. "Shooting Star Dragon" attacks directly (Z-one 4000 → 700). Yusei activates the effect of " Speed World 2 " to remove seven  Speed Counters  and draw a card (Yusei's  SPC : 7 → 0). Yusei Sets a card.
 Turn 9: Z-one   
Z-one draws "Sephylon the Ultimate Timelord". During the Standby Phase, the effect of "Speed World 2" activates (Z-one's SPC: 7 → 8; Yusei's SPC: 0 → 1). As ten or more "Timelords" with different names have been Summoned so far during this Duel, Z-one activates the final effect of " Infinite Light " to send it to the  Graveyard  and  Special Summon  " Sephylon, the Ultimate Timelord " ( 10/4000/4000) in Attack Position. Z-one then activates the first effect of "Sephylon, the Ultimate Timelord" to Special Summon " Metaion, the Timelord " ( 10/0/0), " Sadion, the Timelord " ( 10/0/0), "Gabrion, the Timelord" ( 10/0/0), and "Sandaion, the Timelord" ( 10/4000/4000) from his Deck and Graveyard in Attack Position and make the ATK of all four Special Summoned monsters 4000 ("Metaion, the Timelord": 0 → 4000/0, "Sadion, the Timelord": 0 → 4000/0, "Gabrion, the Timelord": 0 → 4000/0). Due to the second effect of "Sephylon", it gains ATK equal to the total ATK of all other "Timelord" monsters on the field ("Sephylon": 4000 → 20000/4000). 
 "Sephylon" attacks and destroys "Shooting Star Dragon", with the third effect of "Sephylon" negating the effect of any monster it battles, preventing "Shooting Star Dragon" from using its protection effect. Yusei activates his face-down " Converging Wishes " to negate the Battle Damage he would take. Yusei then activates the second effect of "Converging Wishes" to  Synchro Summon  " Stardust Dragon " ( 8/2500/2000) in Attack Position by removing from play " Power Tool Dragon " and " Turbo Synchron " in his Graveyard. Due to the third effect of "Converging Wishes", "Stardust Dragon" gains ATK equal to the total ATK of all  Dragon - Type  Synchro Monsters in Yusei's Graveyard ("Stardust Dragon": 2500 → 23000/2000).
 Yusei then activates the final effect of "Converging Wishes", allowing him to return a Synchro Monster in his Graveyard back to the  Extra Deck  in order to force an opponent's monster to attack. Yusei returns " Ancient Fairy Dragon " to his Extra Deck ("Stardust Dragon": 23000 → 20900/2000) to force "Sephylon" to attack "Stardust Dragon". To prevent himself from taking 900 Battle Damage and losing the Duel, Z-one activates the fourth effect of "Sephylon", removing from play "Metaion, the Timelord" in order to prevent the destruction of "Sephylon" and reduce the Battle Damage he would take to 0 ("Sephylon": 20000 → 16000/4000).
 Yusei returns " Life Stream Dragon " to his Extra Deck ("Stardust Dragon": 20900 → 18000/2000) to force "Sephylon" to attack "Stardust Dragon" again. To prevent himself from taking 2000 Battle Damage and losing the Duel, Z-one removes from play "Sadion, the Timelord" in order to prevent the destruction of "Sephylon" and reduce the Battle Damage he would take to 0 ("Sephylon": 16000 → 12000/4000). 
 Yusei returns " Black Rose Dragon " to his Extra Deck ("Stardust Dragon": 18000 → 15600/2000) to force "Sephylon" to attack "Stardust Dragon" a third time. Z-one removes from play "Gabrion, the Timelord" in order prevent the destruction of "Sephylon" and  reduce the Battle Damage he would take to 0 ("Sephylon": 12000 → 8000/4000). 
 Yusei returns " Black-Winged Dragon " to the Extra Deck ("Stardust Dragon": 15600 → 12800/2000) to force "Sephylon" to attack "Stardust Dragon" a fourth time. Z-one removes from play "Sandaion, the Timelord" in order to prevent the destruction of "Sephylon" and reduce the Battle Damage he would take to 0 ("Sephylon": 8000 → 4000/4000). 
 Yusei returns " Red Dragon Archfiend " to the Extra Deck ("Stardust Dragon": 12800 → 9800/2000) to force "Sephylon" to attack "Stardust Dragon" a fifth time. Because Z-one does not control any other "Timelord" monsters, he is unable to activate the fourth effect of "Sephylon". "Stardust Dragon" destroys "Sephylon" (Z-one 700 → 0).
