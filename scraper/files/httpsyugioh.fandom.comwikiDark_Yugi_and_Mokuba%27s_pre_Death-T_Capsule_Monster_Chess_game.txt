 Events 
 Prior events 
 Mokuba sought to get revenge on Dark Yugi for the  Penalty Game  he inflicted on  Seto Kaiba  after  a game  of  Duel Monsters .
 Mokuba got  Old Man Dentures  to rig his  Capsule Monster Chess  coin machine . Mokuba and  his gang  later arrived at Old Man Dentures' store to meet  Yugi  at the coin machine. After introducing himself as Seto Kaiba's brother, he got his followers seize Yugi to force him into a game. They proceeded to take Dentures coin machine. Dentures acted mad at first, but allowed them to carry on after Mokuba dropped a large amount of money in front of him.
 The gang took Yugi and the dispenser to their hideout, where he had to play  Capsule Monster Chess  against Mokuba. As Mokuba hoped, Yugi changed to Dark Yugi for the game.
 
 Setup 
       The battlefield:  Crisis Hill .     
 They used Battlefield 7:  Crisis Hill  for the game. Mokuba claimed that he does best on this field.
 The rigged dispenser gave Yugi mostly low Level monsters and Mokuba mostly high Level ones. They accepted the stakes that if Mokuba won, he got to cut off one of Yugi's fingers and if Yugi won, Mokuba would have to play a Penalty Game.
 Mokuba's monsters were:
 
 Head Sucker  (Level 5) 
 Gumbo  (Level 5) 
 Cobrada  (level 4) 
 Dinosaur Wing  (Level 5) 
 The Skull  (Level 4) 
 He arranged them a checkered pattern.
 Dark Yugi's monsters were:
 
 Torigun  (Level 2) 
 The Great "Pa"  (Level 4) 
 Eye Mouth  (Level 1) 
 Flower Man  (Level 1) 
 Devil Castle  (Level 1) 
 He put "Torigun" on his left and the other four together in a square on his right.
 Dark Yugi informed Mokuba that the game would be a  Shadow Game .
 
 The game 
 
 Mokuba's turn 
 Mokuba moved " Gumbo " forward.
 
 
 Dark Yugi's turn 
 Dark Yugi replied that he will meet him head on and moved " Eye Mouth " forward.
 
 
 Mokuba's turn 
 Mokuba called Dark Yugi stupid for coming at him with a low Level monsters and used "Gumbo" to slice "Eye Mouth" in two, defeating it.
 Mokuba celebrated beating one of Dark Yugi's monsters, but was surprised to find Dark Yugi laughing too. When questioned about it, Dark Yugi replied that he shall teach Mokuba the rules of gaming; Rule number 1 is that you must act like you have the upper hand, no matter what the circumstances. Disgusted, Mokuba asked if Dark Yugi thought he could teach him. Yugi responded that "Stay cool at all times is rule number 2".
 
 
 Dark Yugi's turn 
 Dark Yugi got " The Great "Pa" " to attack " Cobrada ". Being the same Level, both monsters were destroyed.
 
 
 Mokuba's turn 
 Mokuba got " Dinosaur Wing " to attack and destroy " Flower Man ".
 
 
 Dark Yugi's turn 
 Dark Yugi moved "Devil Castle" to the left.
 
       " Torigun ", taking out Mokuba's monsters.     
 
 Mokuba's turn 
 Mokuba got " Head Sucker " to destroy "Devil Castle.
 
 
 Dark Yugi's turn 
 Mokuba laughed that Dark Yugi was down to 1 monster, while he still had 4. Dark Yugi laughed and diverted Mokuba's attention to the field, where Mokuba's monsters were lined up diagonally with Dark Yugi's last monster, " Torigun ".
 Dark Yugi got "Torigun" to use its special ability, "Whirlwind Razor Beak Slash", to destroy all monsters diagonally aligned with it, taking out Mokuba's remaining monsters.
 
 Aftermath 
       Mokuba's  Penalty Game .     
 Dark Yugi declared that the final rule was "Hold your trump card till the end" and advises Mokuba to remember it well. He then inflicted a  Penalty Game  on Mokuba causing him to believe that a giant  Capsule Monster Chess  capsule had appeared over his head. Before he became fully engulfed in the capsule, Mokuba warned Dark Yugi that Seto's revenge project, Death-T was coming.
 Dark Yugi said that Mokuba was not a match for him, Mokuba should think about that while trapped inside the capsule and can play him again later after learning the rules.
