 Personality 
 Mr. Strong is a firm believer of the "Heavystrong Duel" style, as such he is shown to have be rather narrow-minded and dislikes changes. He assumed that  Gong  had stolen techniques from another school when he  Synchro Summoned  and considered it a disgrace big enough to want to disqualify Gong from the Duel. Despite that, he can be convinced to change his mind if he's impressed, as he accepted Gong's use of Synchro while staying loyal to the Heavystrong style.
 He's shown to be proud of Gong and considers him a worthy inheritor of the Dojo. As a teacher, he appears to be rather strict and tough, as shown when Gong was challenged by him to a "serious match" and the next day had his face covered with band aids. [2] 
 
 Biography 
 Pre-Arc League Championship 
 Nico Smiley  arranged a Duel with Mr. Strong between  Yuya  and  Gong . [1]  He was shocked when Gong  Synchro Summoned  " Superheavy Samurai Warlord Susanowo ". He disapproved Gong's use of Synchro Summon and tried to declare the Duel as a loss for him. Gong defended himself by stating that even the Heavystrong Duel must evolve; otherwise it would be forgotten like an era. Mr. Strong was still reluctant, but allowed the Duel to continue. After watching Gong use Synchro while still keeping to his Heavystrong style, he accepted Gong's decision and congratulated both him and Yuya after the Duel ended. [3] 
 
 Arc League Championship 
 Before Gong's Duel against  Grizzlepike Jones , Mr. Strong approved Gong's vow to take down Grizzlepike and gave him a new sash, which was a tradition of the dojo. When Gong was agonizing over Yuya's safety, Mr. Strong encouraged him to believe in Yuya and in himself, as now was the time for a Heavystrong spirit. [4] 
 
 Friendship Cup 
 After Gong was selected as one of the  Lancers , Mr. Strong challenged him to a "serious match" to test his resolve, which apparently left Gong with several injuries. [5] [2] 
 
 Duel Academy 
 After  Z-ARC 's defeat and the  Standard Dimension  being reborn into the  "Pendulum Dimension" , Mr. Strong is seen watching  Yuya 's Duel against  Jack Atlas  with  You Show Duel School . [6]  and was happy when Yuya won. He then watched Yuya and  Declan 's  Action Duel . [7]  He was happy when Yuya won the Duel and witnessed  Zuzu 's revival. [8]
