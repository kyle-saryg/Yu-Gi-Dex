 If a  Level  8 or higher monster equipped to " Relinquished " is sent from the field to the  Graveyard  (by " Relinquished " being destroyed, or the  Equip Spell Card  being destroyed by " Mystical Space Typhoon "), " A Deal with Dark Ruler " cannot be activated. [1] 
 Previously Official Rulings 
   These TCG rulings were issued by  Upper Deck Entertainment  and have since been deemed unofficial by Konami. [2]  They were previously considered official and can still be correct, as long as they follow the official gameplay rules, or unless Konami has issued a ruling that says otherwise. References:  [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] 
 
 The " Level " in " A Deal with Dark Ruler " is the original Level printed on the  Monster Card . 
 If your opponent's Level 8 or higher monster than  [ sic ]  you control is sent to the  Graveyard , you can activate " A Deal with Dark Ruler ". 
 You cannot activate " A Deal with Dark Ruler " during the  Damage Step . 
 You can only  Special Summon  1 monster with " A Deal with Dark Ruler ", but you can activate 2 copies of " A Deal with Dark Ruler " to Special Summon 1 " Berserk Dragon " for each, even if only 1 Level 8 or higher monster was sent to the Graveyard. 
 Mentions in Other Rulings 
 Berserk Dragon : " Berserk Dragon " cannot be  Normal Summoned  or  Set , and cannot be Special Summoned EXCEPT by the effect of "A Deal with Dark Ruler". So "Berserk Dragon" cannot be Special Summoned with " Monster Reborn ", etc., even if Special Summoned properly first. 
 Trap Monster : You cannot activate " A Deal with Dark Ruler " when " Metal Reflect Slime " is destroyed and sent to the Graveyard because it is a Trap Card in the Graveyard. 
 Out of Date 
 You can activate " A Deal with Dark Ruler " if your Level 8 or higher monster that is an  Equip Spell Card  is sent from your side of the field to the Graveyard (such as " Koitsu " or " Dark Necrofear " destroyed by " Heavy Storm "). [Notes 2]
