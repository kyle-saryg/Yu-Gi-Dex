 Ryuichi Fuwa  (不破龍一,  Fuwa Ryūichi ) is the second of  The Four Game Masters .
 Whilst he has no overt skill in gaming (except, perhaps, very good timing), Ryuichi possesses a supernatural amount of luck. By relying solely on chance, he is capable of winning any challenge. He pushes around  Yugi Mutou  and his friends, under Kaiba's orders, until  Dark Yugi  challenges him to a concentration  Shadow Game . Ryuichi loses when, rather than relying on luck, he chooses a panel that he knew hid a match, only to discover that a short circuit immediately before had replaced the tile, leading to Dark Yugi claiming the victory.
 After this his luck diminishes: as a result of barely mistiming a click while playing the roulette game he used to win effortlessly, he then loses his champion title with the game show that he worked on. Why he seems to now lack luck is never explained: possibly he was robbed of his luck as punishment for losing the Shadow Game, but it could instead be that Fuwa now lacks confidence in himself and any talent that was supplementing his luck, or it could even be that his faith-shattering loss to Dark Yugi is causing him to try too hard rather than just trusting in luck like he did in the past. In any case, this would not be Fuwa's last appearance.
 During the final  Death-T  episode, Ryuichi Fuwa and  Aileen Rao  are paired against  Miho  and  Jonouchi  in a facsimile of a fighting-game: Jonouchi and Aileen have battle suits on, acting as the "characters" being controlled, whilst Miho and Ryuichi are at the controls. Ryuichi and Aileen are confident they will be able to beat Jonouchi and Miho, but the latter pair manage to turn the tables and instead deliver an upset victory against Ryuichi and Aileen.
