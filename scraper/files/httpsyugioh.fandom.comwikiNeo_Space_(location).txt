Neo Space  is a  Duel Monsters Spirit World  appearing in  Yu-Gi-Oh! GX .
 
         Jaden meeting Aqua Dolphin.     
 It is introduced in the second season as a part of the universe inhabited by the " Neo-Spacians " and " Elemental HERO Neos " the latter of whom is the protector of this world, part of which orbits around  Jupiter . 
 Jaden Yuki  was transported to  Io , a moon inhabited by dolphin-like creatures, such as " Aqua Dolphin ". There "Aqua Dolphin" (calling himself Aquos in the dub) made him familiar with the battle between the light and the darkness, good and evil, and the upcoming threat,  the Light of Destruction . Aquos also explained to him that he is destined to fight the Light, as he wields the power of  Darkness of Justice . At that time, Neo Space was invaded by  a Dueling machine , an emissary of the Light. Jaden found  Duel Monsters  cards in a crushed  KaibaCorp  satellite, which he designed as a child, including " Neos ", "Neo-Spacians" and the " Chrysalis " monsters. Using those cards as his new Deck, he successfully defeated the emissary, but his fight against the Light has just begun. Upon his victory, he was brought back to Earth. [1]  As he was fighting the Light, the "Neo-Spacians" would join him in that fight as  Duel Monsters  cards. They also stood by his side in his fight against the Light-affected  Yubel [2]  and in the final Duel with  Nightshroud [3] .
