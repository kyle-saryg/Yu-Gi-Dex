 Featured Duels 
 Declan Akaba vs. Riley Akaba 
 Duel continues from the previous episode . 
 Turn 4: Riley "
 C/C/C Sonic Halberd of Battle " attacks " D/D/D Stone King Darius ".  Declan  finds and  activates  the Action Card " Miracle ", preventing the destruction of "Darius" and halving the battle damage (Declan 900 → 200).
 Turn 5: Declan 
Declan draws " D/D/D Knowledge King Tomb Conquistador " and subsequently activates it (   1) in his right  Pendulum Zone . Declan  Pendulum Summons  " D/D Brownie " (0/0) from his  Extra Deck  in  Attack Position . As "Brownie" was Pendulum Summoned from the Extra Deck, Declan activates its effect,  Tributing  it and another "D/D" monster he controls to  Special Summon  a Pendulum Monster from one of his Pendulum Zones. He Tributes "Darius" and "Brownie" to Special Summon "Conquistador" (3000/2000). Declan activates the effect of "Conquistador", allowing him to send a "Dark Contract" card from his hand to the Graveyard to increase the ATK of "Conquistador" by 1000. He sends " Dark Contract with the Eternal Darkness " ("Conquistador": 3000 → 4000). "Conquistador" attacks and destroys "Sonic Halberd of Battle" (Riley 1000 → 0).
 
 Yusho Sakaki vs. Yuri 
       Yuri  Vs.  Yusho .     
 Turn 1: Yuri 
 Yuri   Normal Summons  " Predaplant Cephalotusnail " (1300/1200) and  Sets  two cards. 
 Turn 2: Yusho 
As Yuri controls a monster while  Yusho  does not, Yusho Special Summons " Performapal Revue Dancer " from his hand in  Attack Position  (800/1000). "Revue Dancer" can be treated as 2 Tributes for the  Tribute Summon  of a "Performapal" monster, so Yusho Tributes it to Tribute Summon " Performapal Sky Magician " (2500/2000). Yusho activates " Magician's Right Hand" , allowing him to negate the activation of a Spell Card once per turn. As Yusho activated a  Continuous Spell Card , the effect of "Sky Magician" activates, increasing its ATK by 300 ("Sky Magician": 2500 → 2800 ATK). "Sky Magician" attacks "Cephalotusnail", but Yuri activates " Dark Seed Planter ", changing the Attribute of all monsters Yusho controls to DARK. It also allows Yuri to negate a DARK monster's attack on a DARK monster he controls. As Yuri activated a Trap Card, Yusho activates the second effect of "Sky Magician", allowing him to return a Continuous Spell Card he controls to his hand, and activate another one from his hand. Yusho returns "Magician's Right Hand" to his hand and activates " Magician's Left Hand " from his hand, which also contains " Clairvoyance " and " Performapal Sky Ring ". "Left Hand" allows him to negate the activation of a Trap Card once per turn. The effect of "Sky Magician activates again ("Sky Magician": 2800 → 3100 ATK) and "Dark Seed Planter" is destroyed. The attack continues, but the effect of "Cephalotusnail" prevents its destruction by battle and halves the damage Yuri takes (Yuri: 4000 → 3100 LP). Yusho activates "Clairvoyance" from his hand, allowing him to guess whether a face-down card his opponent controls is a Spell or Trap Card. If he calls right, this card will be shuffled back to his opponent's Deck and Yusho will draw two cards. If he calls it wrong, the card is re-Set and Yuri can draw two cards. Yusho guesses that Yuri's face-down card is a Spell Card and calls it right, so the revealed " Super Polymerization " is shuffled into Yuri's Deck.
 Duel continues in the next episode .
