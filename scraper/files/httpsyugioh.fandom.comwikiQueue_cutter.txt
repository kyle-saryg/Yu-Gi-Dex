 Biography 
 The boy cut past  Yugi  in a queue to a  Capsule Monster Chess  coin machine, outside  Old Man Dentures  store. Yugi tries to tell him off, but the boy says that Yugi was just "spacing out". He asks isn't Yugi in high school, despite not looking like it, pointing out that he is too old to play Capsule Monsters. Yugi is rebuked, but tries to hide it saying that age doesn't matter to a real gamer. The boy decides that if it means that much to him, Yugi can go first this time. However when Yugi takes his turn, the machine takes his money, without giving him a capsule. [1] 
 The boy starts laughing at Yugi when  Old Man Dentures  tells him off for hitting the machine. However, he goes quiet when  Mokuba Kaiba  arrives. [1]
