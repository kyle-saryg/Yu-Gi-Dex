 " Speed Spell Cards " are  Spell Cards  that work only with the  Field Spells  " Speed World " and " Speed World 2 " and were shown in the anime  Yu-Gi-Oh! 5D's . This type of Spell Card is exclusively used in  Turbo Duels . 
 Almost all Speed Spell cards require a cost of removing  Speed Counters  that are accumulated through "Speed World" or "Speed World 2". During the  Standby Phase , the turn player places one Speed Counter on their "Speed World" card, or both players place one Speed Counter on their "Speed World 2" card. This is a way to balance them, as more powerful cards will require more Speed Counters to be removed. Additionally, there are a few  Trap Cards  that will increase Speed Counters or gain  effects  depending on the number of Speed Counters the player has.
 Turbo Duels can also be played in the Nintendo DS games  Yu-Gi-Oh! 5D's World Championship 2009: Stardust Accelerator ,  Yu-Gi-Oh! 5D's World Championship 2010: Reverse of Arcadia  and  Yu-Gi-Oh! 5D's World Championship 2011: Over the Nexus . In these games, in addition to the several Speed Spells carried over from the anime that were exclusive cards only for Turbo Duels, a number of Speed Spells were created. Some of them were directly based off of existing cards from normal Duels, such as " Speed Spell - Harpie's Feather Duster ", " Speed Spell - The Shallow Grave ", " Speed Spell - Monster Reborn " and " Speed Spell - Raigeki ", while others were directly new (neither based off of existing cards nor used in the anime), such as " Speed Spell - Slowdown Machine ". Some of the mentioned first group of Speed Spells were based off of  Forbidden  cards, like " Speed Spell - Brain Control ", and require a large or very large number of Speed Counters (between 6 and 12) to be removed. No Speed Spell versions of already existing cards were ever seen in the anime. In these games, Speed Spell cards cannot be put in a normal (non-Turbo Duel) Deck, though the Traps that support Turbo Duels can still be used (but will have no effect).
