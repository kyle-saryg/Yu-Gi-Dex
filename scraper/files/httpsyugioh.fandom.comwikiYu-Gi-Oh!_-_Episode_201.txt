 Summary 
 Arrival in Cairo & the "Cartouche" 
 Yugi, Joey, Tristan, and Téa arrive in Cairo, Egypt. They are greeted at the airport by  Marik ,  Ishizu , and  Odion .
 The Ishtars take Yugi & his friends to an ancient tomb holding the  Tablet of Lost Memories  (the same one Ishizu brought to Domino City during the  Battle City  arc). Yugi looks at the Pharaoh's image on the tablet and starts thinking quietly. Téa then takes out a piece of jewelry she just bought at the airport as they arrived, and gives it to him. It's a  Cartouche  pendant. She explains that ancient Egyptian Pharaohs usually engraved their royal names inside cartouches, just like this Pharaoh did on the  Tablet of Lost Memories  (except the cartouche part has been worn off so the name cannot be read). 
 Once the Pharaoh rediscovers his real name he can then engrave it on the pendant, so that he may never forget it again.  Yami Yugi  is touched by Téa's gift, and puts the pendant around his neck.
 
 
 Blast to the Past: The Sacred Court of the Pharaoh 
 Yami then holds his God Cards against the tablet, and the spirit of the  Pharaoh  is transported inside the tablet. At the same time,  Yami Bakura  enters the room and has himself transported along with the Pharaoh, leaving the body of  Bakura Ryou  behind, who immediately collapses to the ground. Bakura's evil spirit merges with the part he had left inside Yugi's  Millennium Puzzle , and the  spirit of  Yami Bakura  is now once again complete.
 The  Pharaoh  and  Bakura  arrive in the "World of Memories". The Pharaoh is transported to his coronation ceremony. His vizier  Shimon Muran  (striking a very close resemblance to Grandpa) guides him through the Royal Palace. The Pharaoh meets the six members of his Royal court, " Sacred Guardians " (Six Priests, in the manga and Japanese anime), who also strike a resemblance to Yugi's present-time friends ( Seto ,  Ishizu , etc.). Each one has been entrusted with a  Millennium Item 
 
 Aknadin  wields the  Millennium Eye . 
 Priest Seto  wields the  Millennium Rod . 
 Isis  wields the  Millennium Necklace . 
 Karim  wields the  Millennium Scale . 
 Mahad  wields the  Millennium Ring . 
 Shada  wields the  Millennium Key . 
 The Pharaoh himself has his  Millennium Puzzle  around his neck, as usual. 
 The Millennium Trial 
 An intruder manages to sneak inside the Royal chamber, and makes an attempt on the Pharaoh's life. He is stopped & caught, initiating a "Millennium Trial".
 Shada  uses the  Millennium Key  to read the assassin's mind, and finds out there is an evil creature (" Dark Spirit of Chaos " in the manga) lurking inside his heart. 
 Aknadin  uses the  Millennium Eye , to reveal & extract the monster dwelling inside the heart of assassin. 
 Priest Seto  uses the  Millennium Rod  to seal the monster inside a Stone Tablet. 
 Now that the darkness in his soul has been banished, the assassin is set free.   Meanwhile, Bakura is transported to his real ancient identity:  Thief King Bakura . In chains to be carried back to the city, he is freed by his followers and led back to his camp. 
 He then endeavors to disguise himself and confront the Pharaoh in the city.  In the present,  Yugi  & his friends are met by  Shadi , who reveals himself to be a century-old spirit gravekeeper.   He admits that  Bakura  destroyed his body an unspecified amount of time ago. 
 He also reveals the fate that awaits the Pharaoh: he must relive his ancient past and fate. He must also play the "Ultimate Dark Game" ( Yami No Game  in Japanese). Yugi & his friends want to help.   Meanwhile,  Thief King Bakura  has ransacked a tomb and gotten a tunic and some treasures. He also has found a sarcophagus in there. He tells his accomplices to go greet the Pharaoh together. 
 Isis feels something approaching: Thief King Bakura and co. are overlooking the city from a hill and Bakura suggests to begin the Dark Game. 
 Trivia 
 Téa keeps the  Cartouche  within her pocket without her friends knowing. 
 Errors 
 From a side-view, when Yami Yugi and his friends start to enter the tomb, Ishizu is seen with a white burqa veil covering her black hair, but then when the scene changes to show the Ishtars, she is no longer wearing it.
