 Summary 
 As  Yami Bakura  demands  Mokuba 's body,  Tristan  knocks him out, takes his  Millennium Ring , and throws it off the  castle  roof into the woods. He then carries Bakura and Mokuba back to the balcony, where  Joey  and  Téa  are witnessing the beginning of a  Shadow Duel . 
 Contact between them and  Yugi  has been cut off and they cannot enter the shadow cloud - they either walk straight through it or return where they started.  
 Inside the shadow, the  Duel  continues. Each monster is maintained by one's life energy and regular Yugi cannot handle the force of the  Shadow Realm .  Yami Yugi  takes over for a time, protesting that Yugi will not survive in such conditions, but Yugi convinces him to switch back and he manages to  Set  a card. But just then,  Pegasus   destroys  Yugi's  defending   monster  and Yugi collapses. Despite Yami Yugi's frantic calls, Yugi is gone. This leaves just Yami Yugi to Duel Pegasus, who can once more read his mind and know all his moves. 
 
 Featured Duel: Yugi Muto/Yami Yugi vs. Maximillion Pegasus 
 
 This Duel uses  Duelist Kingdom  gameplay. Rules and  card effects  may differ from that of the  TCG / OCG . See the individual card articles for more information.     
 Duel continues from the previous episode . 
 Yugi  has 900  LP  remaining and  controls  " Dark Magician " (2500/2100) in  Attack Position  and no  Set  cards. 
 Pegasus  has 600 LP remaining and controls no cards.
 Turn 21: Yugi/Yami Yugi 
Pegasus has just turned the  Duel  into a  Shadow Game . Yugi realizes that he is having difficulties handling the force of the  Shadow Realm , so  Yami Yugi  takes over. Yami Yugi  draws , then passes his turn.
 Turn 22: Pegasus 
Pegasus draws " Dark-Eyes Illusionist " and subsequently  Normal Summons  it (0/0) in Attack Position.
 Turn 23: Yugi/Yami Yugi 
Yami Yugi draws. He then Normal Summons " Curse of Dragon " (2000/1500) in Attack Position. He switches back to Yugi. Yugi again seems to have a hard time handling the force of the  Shadow Realm .
 Turn 24: Pegasus 
Pegasus draws. He then Sets a card.
 Turn 25: Yugi/Yami Yugi 
Yugi draws. Yami Yugi, at this point, fears that Yugi won't be able to handle the stress of the Shadow Realm, so he takes over. "Curse of Dragon"  attacks  "Dark-Eyes Illusionist", but this  activates  the  effect  of "Dark-Eyes Illusionist", which  negates  the attack and forbids "Curse of Dragon" from attacking.
 Turn 26: Pegasus 
Pegasus draws. He then activates his  face-down  " Black Illusion Ritual " to  Tribute  "Dark-Eyes Illusionist" and  Ritual Summon  " Relinquished " (0/0) in Attack Position. Pegasus activates "Relinquished's" effect,  equipping  "Curse of Dragon" to itself and increasing its  ATK  and  DEF  by the ATK and DEF of "Curse of Dragon" ("Relinquished": 0 → 2000/0 → 1500).
 Turn 27: Yugi/Yami Yugi 
Yami Yugi draws. "Dark Magician" attacks "Relinquished", but due to the effect of "Relinquished", "Curse of Dragon" is  destroyed  instead and the  battle damage  that Pegasus would have taken is inflicted to Yami Yugi instead (Yami Yugi: 900 → 400 LP) ("Relinquished": 2000 → 0/1500 → 0).
 Turn 28: Pegasus 
Pegasus draws. He then activates the effect of "Relinquished", equipping "Dark Magician" to itself and increasing its ATK and DEF by the ATK and DEF of "Dark Magician" ("Relinquished": 0 → 2500/0 → 2100).
 Turn 29: Yugi/Yami Yugi 
Yami Yugi switches back to Yugi. Yugi draws a card and subsequently Sets it. He then Normal Summons " Feral Imp " (1300/1400) in  Defense Position .
 Turn 30: Pegasus 
Pegasus draws. "Relinquished" attacks and destroys "Feral Imp". This causes Yugi to collapse under the strain of the Shadow Realm. With Yugi unconscious, Yami Yugi is left to Duel by himself, allowing Pegasus to once more read his mind.
 Turn 31: Yami Yugi 
Yami Yugi draws " Winged Dragon, Guardian of the Fortress " and subsequently Normal Summons it (1400/1200) in Defense Position.
 Turn 32: Pegasus 
Pegasus draws. "Relinquished" attacks and destroys "Winged Dragon". Pegasus then Normal Summons " Jigen Bakudan " (200/1000) in Attack Position. Due to its effect, "Jigen Bakudan" cannot be selected as an  attack target , and it will self-destruct and destroy every  monster  on Pegasus's side of the  field  during Yami Yugi's second  End Phase  after "Jigen Bakudan" was  Summoned . After that, both players will take  damage  equal to the  original ATK  of the monsters they owned. This would be 0 damage to Pegasus and 2500 damage to Yami. 
 Yami Yugi's  hand  contains " Makiu, the Magical Mist ", " Multiply ", " Burning Land ", " Kuriboh " and " Monster Recovery ".
 Duel continues in the next episode . 
 
 Trivia 
 When the Duel continues in the Shadow Realm, Pegasus's  Trap Card  "Gorgon's Eye" disappears, presumably destroyed by "Magical Neutralizing Force". If it had still been active, Pegasus would have won the Duel many times since Yugi defends numerous times once "Relinquished" is Summoned. 
 In the dub, despite possessing the Millennium Eye and the ability to read people's minds, it is hinted (by the quote "whoever you are, perhaps Yugi would've been better off without your interference") that Pegasus is unable to discern the spirit's identity, implying that the latter doesn't even know himself (this is also explained further on throughout the series). 
 Differences in adaptations 
 A shot of Yugi collapsing at the Duel station is cut from the US version. 
 At the end of the episode, when it shows Yugi's hand, every card except for " Kuriboh " is redesigned. 
 In the Japanese version, Bakura desires Mokuba's body as he wants to attain the keys to the Kaiba Corporation. In the US version, Bakura desires Mokuba as a new host. 
 Errors 
 In the last episode, Yugi had two cards in his hand before the episode ended. At the start of this episode, he has three cards in his hand. 
 In the dub, when  Maximillion Pegasus   Normal Summons  " Dark-Eyes Illusionist ", the card is shown as a Level 1 monster with 1400 DEF instead of being a Level 2 monster with 0 ATK and DEF like in the Japanese.
