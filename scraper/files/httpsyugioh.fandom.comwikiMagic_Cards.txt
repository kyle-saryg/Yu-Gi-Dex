 Spell Cards  (Japanese:  魔 法 カード  Mahō Kādo , or  魔法 カード  Majikku Kādo  "Magic Card" in early releases of the  OCG Series 3  and in the anime; Japanese symbol text:  魔   Ma  or  魔   Majikku ), called  Magic Card  in the  TCG  until the release of  Magician's Force , are cards with green-colored borders that have various effects to alter the play of the game. Often, a Spell Card has a single effect to provide a bonus to the user or a weakness to the opponent. Unlike  Trap Cards , Spell Cards have the advantage of being able to be played without having to be  Set  first. Spell Cards, except  Quick-Play Spell Cards , may be activated during the same turn it was  Set .
 A player may activate and Set as many Spell Cards as they wish during their turn. All Spell Cards are  Spell Speed 1  (meaning they can only be activated as  Chain  Link 1), with the exception of  Quick-Play Spell Cards  which are  Spell Speed 2  (meaning they can be activated in  response  to Spell Speed 1 and 2  Chain Links ). Spell Cards, except Quick-Play Spell Cards, can only be activated during their possessor's  Main Phase  (except " Curse of Fiend "); Quick-Play Spell Cards can be activated from their possessor's hand during their turn, or while Set on the field during either player's turn.
 After activation, Spell Cards (with the exception of  Continuous ,  Field  and  Equip Spell Cards ) are sent to the Graveyard.
 Some very powerful Spell Cards have been  Forbidden  from  Advanced Format  tournament play, such as " Pot of Greed ". In many cases,  Konami  has released similar cards with less powerful or more restrictive effects to serve as replacements for some of these Forbidden cards. For instance, "Pot of Greed" has been replaced by the weaker " Pot of Desires ", which provides the same bonus as "Pot of Greed" but comes with a considerable activation cost (whereas " Pot of Greed " has no activation cost at all).
 Used properly, a single Spell Card can significantly alter the game in the user's favor, or even cause them to win the  Duel .

 Layout 
 The layout of Spell Cards is noticeably different from Monster Cards, but quite similar to that of Trap Cards (except the border color).
 
 Border 
 The most noticeable difference between Spell Cards and Monster Cards is the border color. While most Monster Cards are yellow or orange, Spell Cards are blue-green.
 
 Card name 
 
This part of the card contains only one significant difference from Monster Cards—the  Attribute  symbol is replaced by a Spell symbol due to the fact that Spell (and Trap) Cards do not have Attributes.
 
 Card type 
 
The  card type  is located below the name, where the Level is normally found on Monster Cards. This piece of text indicates that the card is a Spell Card. An icon next to the "Spell Card" text inside the brackets indicates the card's type (refer to the symbols above).
 
 Card artwork 
   " Monster Reborn ", original Japanese artwork.   " Monster Reborn ", edited international artwork. 1/2 
 The card artwork is also present here and shows the player a visual interpretation of the used card. The artwork of a given card may be different between its  OCG  and  TCG  printings. For example, in the case of "Monster Reborn", its artwork is that of an  ankh  symbol in the OCG but was redone when it was brought over to the TCG in order to avoid religious connotations.
 
 Card text box 
 
Unlike the Monster Card text box (which provide the monster's  Type ,  ATK  and  DEF ), Spell cards' text boxes serve only one purpose - providing the card effect.
 
 Other elements 
 All other basic card elements can also be seen in Spells. These include the Edition text,  Set Number ,  passcode , copyright text and the  Eye of Anubis Hologram .
