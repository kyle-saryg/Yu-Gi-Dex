A  field-unique  card is a card that has a  condition  that prevents more than 1 card being on the field with its name. This means that if a field-unique card is face-up on any player's field, and a new one is placed on the field face-up or flipped face-up, then all new copies are sent to the Graveyard by  game mechanics  instead. Furthermore, if there is already a field-unique card face-up on the field, another card with the same name cannot be Summoned face-up (even if the Summon would cause the copy already on the field to be removed).
 Additional copies can exist face-down (so they can be Set/Special Summoned face-down), but as soon as they are flipped face-up the restriction applies and sends them to the Graveyard. Furthermore, they cannot be Flip Summoned if another copy is already face-up on the field. If another copy of a face-up field-unique monster is attempted to be Summoned from Graveyard or  Banished  Zone, such by the effect of " Return from the Different Dimension ", then all illegal Summons will simply fail at resolution. [1] 
 All " Earthbound Immortal " and most " Malefic " monsters are field-unique with other cards of that same archetype.

 Side-Unique 
 
 Side-Unique cards are essentially the same rule as Field-Unique, except that they apply only to a single player's field. ie: Both players can have the same card on their field without either being destroyed as a State-Based Action; however a given player may still only have one on their field, treated the same way as Field-Unique.
