 It included the tarot card,  The High Priestess , featuring  Ishizu Ishtar  in its design.
 
 Afterword 
 Kazuki Takahashi  says that he took a trip to Egypt to gather information on mystery and occult, which he could incorporate into his stories, but reading back over " The Man from Egypt ", he finds it surreal and abstract. He tried to make character  Shadi  wrapped in mystery and questionable as to whether he was even alive, but since thinks that it may have been hard to introduce that to the readers. Shadi's storylines took a nose dive in popularity, and resulted in talk of a discontinuation. This was problematic for Takahashi, as he had intended to further explore his relationship with  the Pharaoh . Mixed between whether to stick with his policies or discontinue it, he felt like he had gone astray in the  labyrinth of his mind .
 Takahashi also speaks about " The Cards with Teeth ", which is the story that first featured  Duel Monsters  and its associated character,  Seto Kaiba . "The Cards with Teeth" gained strange popularity, with reader inquiries flooding the editorial department the week it was first featured in  Weekly Shonen Jump . The name Seto was derived from the Egyptian deity  Set . Takahashi had originally considered making Kaiba the heir to a gaming company and have him challenge Yugi using strange games he continuously comes up with, but on short notice, ended up having him play  Duel Monsters  a second time. He also reconstructed Kaiba to make him a semi-lead character and rival to  Yugi . Takahashi commented that he was surprised that several years later, this developed into a record-breaking real world card game.
