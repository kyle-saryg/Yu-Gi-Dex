As with the previous three spin-off series ( 5D's ,  ZEXAL , and  ARC-V ),  VRAINS  introduces and focuses on a new type of Summoning:  Link Summoning .

 Story

 The series is based in a world roughly 10 years from now where a massive Virtual Reality Network called LINK VRAINS has been established. It’s a suspense thriller style story where Yusaku fights in order to learn the truth of events in the past. 
 The sixth series focuses on  Yusaku Fujiki , a high-schooler and a hacker who doesn't like standing out. However, he gets drawn into encounters with people as he tries out  Dueling  for once. 
 There is a city where network systems have evolved:  Den City . In this city, with the advanced network technology developed by the corporation  SOL Technologies , a Virtual Reality space called  LINK VRAINS  (Link Virtual Reality Artificial Intelligence Network System) has been developed. By using LINK VRAINS which was built inside the Network System, Duels unfold where Duelists change their appearance separate from their real life identities, and in this VR Space people became excited over the latest way to Duel.

 However, in LINK VRAINS, a mysterious hacker group that hacks via Dueling has appeared:  The Knights of Hanoi . Their goal is to destroy the AI World known as Cyberse that exists somewhere in the depths of the Network.
 However, there is one Duelist who stands against the threat to LINK VRAINS. His name is Playmaker. He has become famous in the Network World for crushing the Knights of Hanoi in fierce Duels, without mentioning his name. But the true identity of Playmaker is ordinary high school student Yusaku Fujiki, who pursues the Knights of Hanoi that appear in VRAINS in order to find out the truth of an incident that happened in his past.
 The show's theme is "Take a step forward, and try!", on the premise that kids should start to try things out instead of just giving up at the first try due to being overwhelmed by information. [6]

 Development 
 As of episode 14, Masahiro Hosoda, due to unknown reasons, stepped down as Director and was replaced by Asano Katsuya. It is to be noted that as of this episode, the backgrounds of LINK VRAINS and the Link Summoning methods were changed and more detail was added, possibly due to the change. Even the point gauge for the Link Monsters, included Link Markers. [1]  In addition, since the same episode, the series was under the supervision of Satou Tatsuo (best known as director of  Martian Successor Nadesico  series), who oversaw Asano's direction of the series.

 Trivia 
 This is the second spin-off series, after  ZEXAL , where the new type of monster introduced (in this case,  Link Monsters ) does not have a  Level  (instead, they have a  Link Rating ).
 It is also the first where the new monster type does not have a  DEF . 
 Similar to  ZEXAL , the previous series'  summoning method  is not used. 
 The English dub of  VRAINS  is the first series with an instrumental theme song since the  original series . 
 This series has the only English dub where:
 Death and death threats aren't rare. 
 The monster Attributes and Spell & Trap icons are translated. 
 The opening theme song lacks any vocals. (The original theme song contains distorted "lyrics" of the phrases "Your move", "Yu-Gi-Oh!", and Yugi's famous dub quote; "It's Time to Duel!"). 
 This is the last series to:
 Air in the 2010s. 
 Be produced by Gallop Studios, as the  succeeding series  is animated by Bridge. 
 This is the only series so far:
 That does not have canon manga material, a tournament arc, a  Battle Royal , or 2 vs. 2  Tag Duels . 
 To have an uneven amount of openings and endings (3 of the former and 5 of the latter). 
 This series has seven clip shows, which make up 5.83% of the series' runtime. 
 Unlike  other   series  to introduce new  duel   categories , this series' final battle does not use its introduced  duel format . 
 VRAINS  is the first series not to reuse sound effects from previous  Yu-Gi-Oh!  series.
