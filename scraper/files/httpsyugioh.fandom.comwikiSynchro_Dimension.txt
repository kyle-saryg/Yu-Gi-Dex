      The Four Dimensions. (Click on one of the dimensions to go to its page.)     
 The  Synchro Dimension  (シンクロ 次 元   Shinkuro Jigen ) is one of the  Four Dimensions  in the  Yu-Gi-Oh! ARC-V  anime, where nearly all  Duelists  use  Synchro Monsters . [1]  This dimension is where  New Domino City ,  Yugo 's homeland, is located. Alternate versions of numerous characters in the  Yu-Gi-Oh! 5D's  anime such as  Jack Atlas ,  Crow Hogan ,  Hunter Pace ,  Rathie ,  Sayer ,  Hippies ,  Don Piero ,  Dobocle ,  Lazar , and  Dexter  also reside in this dimension.  Duel Runners  and  Turbo Duels  also exist in this dimension. [2] 
 Unlike the other dimensions, the Synchro Dimension does not seem to be affected by  Duel Academy 's invasion and are unaware of the existence of the other dimensions as shown when  Zuzu  and Yugo tried to give warnings to the residents of New Domino of the possible invasion of Duel Academy and were passed off as weird, with the residents assuming that the information they gave was a hoax. Synchro Dimension was only introduced to  Real Solid Vision  technology after the arrival of  Jean-Michel Roget  some time after the arrest of  Chojiro Tokumatsu . Additionally, most of its inhabitants were unaware of the existence of  Fusion ,  Xyz , and  Pendulum Monsters  until  Celina ,  Shay Obsidian ,  Yuya Sakaki , and  Dennis McField  performed their Summons in the dimension.  Double Tuning  is also used in this dimension by  Jack Atlas . It is implied that this is unique to this dimension as Yuya was unaware of it during his Duel with Jack.

 Trivia 
 In this dimension, the  Zero Reverse  event never occurred and thus the creation of the  Satellite  was never formed, however there was still a huge segregation between the upper and lower classes. 
 Unlike normal Japanese names, the names of most residents of the Synchro Dimension are spoken first name to last name, as opposed to the other way around. This is because, like most  Yu-Gi-Oh! 5D's  characters, most of its inhabitants have English, German, Spanish, French, and Russian names, with Chojiro Tokumatsu being the sole exception. 
 The Synchro Dimension has the most alternate characters from a previous series (Yu-Gi-Oh! 5D's) to appear in Yu-Gi-Oh! ARC-V.
