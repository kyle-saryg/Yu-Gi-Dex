 Summary 
       Astral  detects the energy emitted from a  crest .     
 Mr. Heartland  urges the crowd to congratulate  Kite  on his victory. He says that along with  Vetrix , Kite has reached the semifinals. Their names are shown on the  Duel Coaster Stadium  screen and Heartland continues that there are only two slots left, while the other finalists are shown -  Quattro ,  Yuma ,  Shark  and  Nistro . He wonders who will survive and says that he's sure Duel fans around the world are excited for the conclusion and tells them all to yell "Heart Burning!". Yuma is back on his  Duel Coaster  and yells that he'll go all the way to defeat Vetrix and  Dr. Faker . He says he won't forgive them for using their children as tools of revenge.  Astral  says he feels a strong pulse coming from the left side - the same one given off by the  crests  of  Trey  and  Quinton . Yuma asks if that means Vetrix is there and Astral says that could be it and Yuma speeds off in that direction.
 Heartland displays the  Duel Field , " Magma Field ", on the monitor and wonders who will arrive at that battlefield. Shark steps onto the field.  Summer  is excited, saying Shark is so cool.  Cathy  pops up in front of her and says she doesn't care if it's not Yuma  Dueling . Shark faces Quattro, saying he finally caught him and he won't let him escape this time. Quattro says that's bothersome and insists he didn't run away - he lured him here. He says that in this world of fire and heat, Shark will be at a disadvantage. Since Shark's Deck is full of  WATER - Attribute   monsters , he won't be able to survive here. Now  Jen  is excited, urging Quattro to give them his fanservice today.  Bronk  realizes they don't know of Quattro's true persona and  Caswell  says his true identity is that of a devil.
 The Duel begins, with Shark taking the first  turn . Shark tells Quattro not to underestimate him and  activates  " Plate Salvage ", which will  negate  the  effects  of  face-up   Field Spell Cards  until the end of Quattro's next turn. Ice covers the volcanoes and lava pools, with Shark smirking. Yuma,  Tori  and Astral arrive at the field; Shark seems surprised to see Yuma, but Quattro does not. Tori asks if this is really the Magma Field and Yuma says its not hot at all. Yuma sneezes and Astral says that's expected of Shark - he must have negated the effects with a  Spell Card . Vetrix appears in the form of what seems to be a hologram, saying its finally begun. He declares that its an important fight for both of them and urges them to fight their hardest as he watches. His crest's power radiates outward. 
 
       The  effect  of " Submersible Carrier Aero Shark ".     
 Shark  Normal Summons  " Tripod Fish " and announces that since he  controls  a face-up  Fish - Type  monster, he can  Special Summon  " Shark Stickers " from his  hand  via its own effect. Yuma says there are two  Level  3 monsters and Astral says " Xyz Summon ". Shark  overlays  his monsters to Xyz Summon " Submersible Carrier Aero Shark " in  Attack Position . He activates its effect,  detaching  an  Overlay Unit  to inflict  damage  to Quattro equal to the number of cards in his hand times 400. "Aero Shark" fires three missiles, which hit Quattro, knocking him onto his back and dropping his  Life Points  to 2800. Yuma says Shark is so cool, inflicting effect damage on his first turn. Bronk and Caswell cheer and Shark  Sets  two cards, ending his turn.
 Quattro chuckles, saying they've only just started and he's already Xyz Summoned. He compliments Shark, but says it gives him the urge to break him. As Shark controls an  Xyz Monster  and Quattro controls no monsters, he is able to Special Summon " Gimmick Puppet Magnet Doll " from his hand via its own effect. He Normal Summons " Gimmick Puppet Gear Changer ", explaining he can make it have the same Level as another " Gimmick Puppet " he controls. He says its time for a gear change and "Gear Changer" becomes Level 8. Tori says that now Quattro has two monsters of the same Level as well. Yuma says he's coming and Quattro overlays his two monsters to Xyz Summon " Number 15: Gimmick Puppet Giant Grinder " in Attack Position. Yuma says its appeared - the " Number " that devastated Bronk and Caswell. Quattro announces that if Shark is coming at him all the way, he must do the same. He says he'll give Shark the ultimate fanservice. 
 
       " Number 15: Gimmick Puppet Giant Grinder " fires.     
 Summer wonders what that monster is and Jen doesn't appear to know either. Suddenly, the feed is cut and Heartland wonders what happened. He says its unfortunate that complications occurred again in such an important Duel. However, this time he is being sincere and he wonders if it was "their" work. Vetrix appears at the field again, giggling and saying he felt that the rest of the Duel shouldn't be shown, so he broke the cameras. He tells Quattro to send Shark all the way into the darkness. Quattro activates the effect of "Giant Grinder", destroying "Aero Shark" since it is an Xyz Monster. Its devoured by the hole in the chest of "Giant Grinder". A cannon then emerges from the hole, firing, knocking Shark off his feet and dropping his Life Points to 2100. (cut from the dub is "Aero Shark" being absorbed and grinded by "Giant Grinder". The cannon-like object of "Giant Grinder" is also made less realistic).
 Yuma yells Shark's name and Quattro declares a  direct attack . "Giant Grinder" attacks with its whip, but Shark activates his  face-down  " Bubble Bringer ", negating the attack. Yuma says Shark is safe, but Quattro says it doesn't matter - the effects of "Magma Field" will return now, adding that it will be a scorching hell. He ends his turn and the volcanoes erupt, melting the ice. Yuma says its really hot and Tori says it really is a scorching hell. Shark tells Quattro to save the bravado for the when the Duel is over. He Normal Summons " Hammer Shark " and activates another effect of "Bubble Bringer",  sending  it to the Graveyard to Special Summon "Tripod Fish" from the Graveyard. The effect of "Tripod Fish" activates as it was Special Summoned, so its Level increases by 1, to 4. 
 
         The " Solar Flare Dragons " of " Magma Field " attempt to  destroy   Shark 's  monsters .     
 Quattro calls Shark an idiot, explaining that "Magma Field" will destroy all WATER-Attribute monsters when they are Summoned. He says Shark's monsters cannot live in this environment. Two " Solar Flare Dragons " spring from the lava and jump at Shark's monsters, but an energy shield is suddenly erected in front of Shark. Quattro and Yuma are confused and Astral says its a  Trap Card . Shark has activated a  Continuous Trap , " Adapt to Adversity ". He explains that it prevents monsters from being destroyed by effects that activate upon their Summoning. He says that now his monsters can survive the scorching hell. Yuma cheers and Astral again says that's to be expected of Shark - you cannot underestimate him. 
 
         " Hammer Shark " and " Tripod Fish ".     
 Shark remembers falling into Quattro's trap at the  National Duel Circuit  and knows that Quattro hurt his  sister , who had nothing to do with that match. He says he won't forgive him and no matter what, he will defeat him. Shark reveals that the monster Summoned with "Bubble Bringer" can be treated as two Overlay Units for an Xyz Summon. Shark overlays his now-three Level 4 monsters to Xyz Summon " Number 32: Shark Drake " in Attack Position. Yuma remembers that card and Vetrix says that's right - its the card Trey gave to Shark, by Vetrix's command, that is. Vetrix says he was waiting for this moment, which would increase the darkness in Shark's heart. Quattro is shocked, saying that card was Trey's.
 
         Vetrix  explains  Quattro 's role to him.     
 Quattro says he knew Quinton and Vetrix were planning something, but he never imagined they'd use Trey to give Shark a "Number". Vetrix appears behind him and says there's a reason he didn't tell him. Quattro asks what that is and Vetrix responds that Quattro would have ruined the plan with his loose tongue. Vetrix's hologram begins to randomly teleport around and he says that everyone has their own role. Quinton had his and Trey had his. Quattro asks what his role is and Vetrix responds that it is to send Shark's heart into darkness. He adds that its gone according to plan so far and that Quattro has done well. Quattro didn't know all of it was part of Vetrix's plan and Vetrix says it should have been obvious. He adds that Quattro won't get away safely if he underestimates Shark but says he should know the powers of both Shark and "Shark Drake" well.
 Shark orders "Shark Drake" to attack "Giant Grinder", who explodes as Quattro's Life Points drop to 1500. Shark declares the effect of "Shark Drake", detaching an Overlay Unit to Special Summon the destroyed "Giant Grinder" with 1000 less  ATK . Tori asks why's he reviving his opponent's monster and Astral says that "Shark Drake" can now attack it again. Yuma realizes Quattro has only 1500 Life Points left, so Shark has won. "Giant Grinder" rises from the lava with 500 ATK, but Quattro says he won't let Shark do that. He activates the effect of the " Gimmick Puppet Twilight Joker " in his hand,  banishing  "Giant Grinder" from his Graveyard to Special Summon itself. "Twilight Joker" appears and cuts the strings of "Giant Grinder", who falls back into the lava. Vetrix says Shark made a strong move, but Quattro did counter it - with that Quattro can continue fighting and push Shark even more. Shark says he narrowly escaped and ends his turn. Vetrix says Quattro must fight harder - Shark is still alive and kicking. Quattro turns and yells that he knows that. No one but Quattro can see Vetrix, so they wonder what's going on. Quattro says he understands - his role is to push Shark into the darkness. In order to fulfill that, he had hurt his younger sister and set a trap at the Duel Circuit. 
 
         Vetrix's holograms split and explain his plan.     
 He yells he did it all for Vetrix, by Vetrix's command. Tori asks what that means and Shark tells Vetrix to come out if he's here. He appears before Shark, who rushes at him, but the hologram just flickers and reappears elsewhere. Yuma asks if Vetrix is here and Astral says they must be able to see him through some strange power. Vetrix says that's correct and he expected that of Astral. Astral asks what Vetrix's end goal is - what is the point of all this? Vetrix says there's no use in hiding it from anyone here. Three holograms of Vetrix appear, one each in front of Yuma, Tori and Astral. They say the reason that Shark must be pushed into darkness is for Vetrix to control him - as an assassin to defeat Dr. Faker. Shark says he has no reason to do anything like that, while Vetrix insists he'll have no choice - he will become his puppet. Quattro says he and his brothers fought hard for Vetrix - why were they not chosen? He says he won't accept it and Vetrix again responds that everyone has their own role - and Shark fits the role of assassin better than Quattro. Enraged, Quattro says he will be the one to take down Faker. First, he will prove he's stronger than Shark.
 Quattro begins his turn, playing " Gimmick Puppet Ritual ". He explains it will Special Summon a "Gimmick Puppet" from his Graveyard, put it may not attack this turn. He tells "Magnet Doll" to return and overlays it with "Twilight Joker" to Xyz Summon " Number 40: Gimmick Puppet of Strings " in Attack Position. He  equips  it with " String of Destiny ", which augments its sword. He explains that it sends the top card of his Deck to the Graveyard and if its a monster, "Gimmick Puppet of Strings" will be able to attack a number of times equal to that monster's Level, but the attacked monster will not be  destroyed by battle . The card is " Gimmick Puppet Dreary Doll , so Quattro may now attack "Shark Drake" eight times. He orders his first attack with  "Heaven's Blade"  ("Celestial Slash" in the dub) dropping Shark to 1900 Life Points. Astral says that with "String of Destiny", the damage will pile up quickly. Quattro tells "Gimmick Puppet of Strings" to make Shark suffer more and it attacks again. It attacks a third time, with Tori looking away in horror and Yuma telling Quattro to stop, insisting that this isn't Dueling. He says Dueling isn't for anger and revenge. 
 
         Vetrix ensnares  Yuma .     
 Vetrix reappears in front of him, saying he won't allow him to interfere. His crest activates and Yuma is tied in chains, now unable to move. Vetrix says this is the climax and tells Yuma to watch quietly. Shark's Life Points are now 1300. Tori yells for Quattro to stop and Yuma says that Dueling is to make people happy, not make them suffer. Quattro tells Shark to suffer more and then land in hell, ordering his sixth attack (fifth in the dub). Yuma continues to rant, saying that those who Duel become friends - it shouldn't be used to hurt people. Vetrix appears to Yuma again, saying he really is just like  Kazuma . Vetrix says Kazuma always talked of Yuma, of bonds and of making people happy. He says it was Vetrix that involved Kazuma and Vetrix responds that the one who took Yuma's father from him is Dr. Faker. If Yuma must hate someone, it should be Faker. 
 
         The effects of the  Duel  take their toll on Shark.     
 Vetrix continues that if that happens, darkness will be born from Yuma's heart and then spread. Vetrix says he did promise Yuma he would eat his heart next time. Yuma tells to shut up and says he won't forgive him for hurting  Dextra  like that and used his own sons for revenge. Vetrix says that's very good - darkness is being born in his heart from his anger. Vetrix urges Yuma to hate both him and Faker. He yells for Vetrix to shut up and Quattro declares his last attack, dropping Shark to 500 Life Points. Quattro continues that its not the end and activates the effect of "Gimmick Puppet of Strings", detaching an Overlay Unit to place a  String Counter  on "Shark Drake". It is ensnared in crimson strings, and Quattro says that at Shark's End Phase, "Shark Drake" will be destroyed and Shark will take damage equal to its ATK. Quattro ends his turn and Yuma yells to Shark, telling him to speak. Shark does not respond.
 
 Featured Duel: Shark vs. Quattro 
         Shark  vs.  Quattro .     
 This  Duel  takes place at a  Duel Field , " Magma Field ". It is treated as a  face-up   Field Spell Card . Its  effect  will  destroy  any  WATER - Attribute   monster  that is Summoned. The  Duelists  begin with the amount of  Life Points  they had at the end of the  Duel Coaster . In this case, both players have 4000.
 
         " Tripod Fish " and " Shark Stickers ".     
 Turn 1: Shark 
 Shark  draws. He then  activates  " Plate Salvage " to  negate  the effects of all face-up Field Spell Cards. He then  Normal Summons  " Tripod Fish " ( 3/300/1300) in Attack Position. As he Summoned a  Fish - Type  monster, Shark  Special Summons  " Shark Stickers " ( 3/200/1000) in  Attack Position  via its own effect. Shark  overlays  "Tripod Fish" and "Shark Stickers" in order to  Xyz Summon  " Submersible Carrier Aero Shark " ( 3/1900/1000, ORU: 2) in Attack Position. Shark activates the effect of "Submersible Carrier Aero Shark" to  detach  an Overlay Unit ("Submersible Carrier Aero Shark": 2 → 1 ORU) and inflict 400  damage  to Quattro for each card in his hand. Shark has three cards (Quattro: 4000 → 2800 LP). Shark  Sets  two cards.
 
         " Gimmick Puppet Gear Changer " and " Gimmick Puppet Magnet Doll ".     
 Turn 2: Quattro 
Quattro draws. As Shark  controls  an  Xyz Monster  and Quattro controls no monsters, Quattro Special Summons " Gimmick Puppet Magnet Doll " ( 8/1000/1000) in Attack Position via its own effect. He Normal Summons " Gimmick Puppet Gear Changer " ( 1/100/100) in Attack Position. Quattro then activates the effect of "Gimmick Puppet Gear Changer" to  target  "Gimmick Puppet Magnet Doll" and change the Level of "Gimmick Puppet Gear Changer" to that of "Gimmick Puppet Magnet Doll" ("Gimmick Puppet Gear Changer":   1 → 8). Quattro overlays "Gimmick Puppet Magnet Doll" and "Gimmick Puppet Gear Changer" in order to Xyz Summon " Number 15: Gimmick Puppet Giant Grinder " ( 8/1500/2500, ORU: 2) in Attack Position. 
 Quattro activates the effect of "Gimmick Puppet Giant Grinder" to detach an Overlay Unit ("Gimmick Puppet Giant Grinder": 2 → 1 ORU) to  destroy  all other face-up Xyz Monsters on the field and inflict damage to their  controllers  equal to their  ATK ; "Submerisble Carrier Aero Shark" is destroyed (Shark: 4000 → 2100 LP). "Gimmick Puppet Giant Grinder" attacks  directly , but Shark activates his  face-down  " Bubble Bringer " to negate the attack. On Quattro's End Phase, the effect of "Plate Salvage" expires.
 Turn 3: Shark 
Shark draws " Hammer Shark " and subsequently Normal Summons it ( 4/1700/1500) in Attack Position. He then activates the second effect of "Bubble Bringer" to send it to the  Graveyard  and revive "Tripod Fish" ( 3/300/1300) in Attack Position as well as treat "Tripod Fish" as two monsters for an Xyz Summon. As "Tripod Fish" was revived, Shark activates its effect to increase its Level by one ("Tripod Fish":   3 → 4). The effect of "Magma Field" activates, but Shark activates his face-down " Adapt to Adversity ", which will prevent his WATER monsters from being destroyed by the effects of  Spell / Trap Cards  when they are Summoned. 
 Shark overlays "Hammer Shark" and "Tripod Fish" in order to Xyz Summon " Number 32: Shark Drake " ( 4/2800/2100, ORU: 2) in Attack Position. "Shark Drake" attacks and destroys "Gimmick Puppet Giant Grinder" (Quattro: 2800 → 1500 LP). Shark activates the effect of "Shark Drake" to  detach  an Overlay Unit ("Shark Drake": 2 → 1 ORU) and revive "Gimmick Puppet Giant Grinder" with 1000 less ATK under Quattro's control in order to let "Shark Drake" attack it again, but Quattro activates the effect of " Gimmick Puppet Twilight Joker " to Special Summon it ( 8/800/1600) in Attack Position by  banishing  "Gimmick Puppet Giant Grinder" from his Graveyard (as a " Gimmick Puppet " monster was  destroyed by battle ). This makes the effect of "Shark Drake" resolve without effect.
 Turn 4: Quattro 
Quattro draws. As he has less than 2000 Life Points, Quattro activates " Gimmick Puppet Ritual " to revive "Gimmick Puppet Magnet Doll" ( 8/1000/1000) in Attack Position, though it may not attack this turn. He then overlays "Gimmick Puppet Twilight Joker" and "Gimmick Puppet Magnet Doll" in order to Xyz Summon " Number 40: Gimmick Puppet of Strings " ( 8/3000/2000, ORU: 2) in Attack Position. 
 Quattro  equips  "Gimmick Puppet of Strings" with " String of Destiny ". "Gimmick Puppet of Strings" attacks "Shark Drake" and Quattro activates the effect of "String of Destiny" to send the top card of his Deck to the Graveyard. If it is a monster, then "Gimmick Puppet of Strings" will be able to attack a number of times equal to the sent monster's Level, but "Shark Drake" will not be  destroyed by battle  this turn. If it is not a monster, the attack will be negated and the  Battle Phase  will end. The sent card is " Gimmick Puppet Dreary Doll ", which is Level 8. "Gimmick Puppet of Strings" attacks "Shark Drake" eight times, but none of the attacks destroy "Shark Drake" (Shark: 2100 → 1900 → 1700 → 1500 → 1300 → 1100 → 900 → 700 → 500 LP). Quattro activates the effect of "Gimmick Puppet of Strings" to detach an Overlay Unit ("Gimmick Puppet of Strings": 2 → 1 ORU) and place a  String Counter  on all other monsters on the field. During Shark's next End Phase, all monsters with String Counters will be destroyed and the destroyed monsters' controllers will take damage equal to the  original ATK  of each of their destroyed monsters. 
 Duel continues in  the next episode .
