 Transporter 
         Vector  traveling through the "Overlay Network".     
 The  Barian  race is able to use an Overlay Network to instantly teleport themselves to another place. [1]  The  crests  utilized by the  Vetrix Family  are able to do the same. [2]  Later in the series, the  Different Dimension Airship  uses an Overlay Network to travel as well. [3] 
 An Overlay Network can be used for communication, as sound can travel through them. When used this way, the portal stays open until the message or conversation is finished transmitting. [4] 
 
 Xyz Summon 
         An Overlay Network during a  Duel .     
 According to  Konami ,  Xyz Monsters  have traveled to  Yuma's dimension  from the other side of a black hole. [5]  When a  Duelist  performs an  Xyz Summon , the  Xyz Material  monsters transform into streaks of energy, and an Overlay Network appears in the form of a portal that the energy streaks enter. The portal then explodes, and the newly Summoned Xyz Monster unveils itself. [6]  In  Yu-Gi-Oh! ARC-V , instead of exploding, a column of blue light emerges from the center of the portal. Most  Xyz Monsters  are Xyz Summoned through a red, spiral-shaped portal. [7]  After being Summoned, the Xyz Materials then become  Overlay Units  that orbit the Xyz Monster as orbs of light. [6] 
 The " Number " monsters all use a yellow, galaxy-like portal, though " Neo Galaxy-Eyes Photon Dragon " utilizes a pink one [2]  and " Shark Fortress " a blue, despite neither being "Number" monsters. [8] [9]  In addition, the sealed form of the Summoned "Number" appears out of the portal first, before transforming itself into its true form (some "Number" monsters such as " Number 88: Gimmick Puppet of Leo " [10]  and " Number 33: Chronomaly Machu Mech " [11]  do not have sealed forms and simply emerge complete from the Overlay Network; others such as " Number 9: Dyson Sphere " are too large to ever fit in an Overlay Network and instead materialize in space [12] ). 
 When a Duelist performs an  Xyz Evolution  (whether through a " Rank-Up-Magic " card or otherwise), the Xyz Monster re-enters the Overlay Network before emerging from it in its upgraded form (usually but not always a " Chaos Xyz " or " Chaos Number " monster). [13] [1] [14] [15]  Once the monster re-enters the Network, the Network explodes, often taking the form of a large green orb before the monster reforms.
 In  Yu-Gi-Oh! 5D's Tag Force 6 , all Xyz Monsters are depicted as using the standard red spiral portal.
 " Galaxy Stealth Dragon " [16]  and all Xyz Monsters featured in  Yu-Gi-Oh! ARC-V  use the "Number" Overlay Network. [17] 
 In  Yu-Gi-Oh! VRAINS , the Overlay Network no longer appears as a galaxy-like portal, rather it appears as a large blue "X" with a square in the middle and four small red nodes at the tips. Once the Xyz Materials enter the nodes, they light up and manifest two red bars as a red circle forms behind the "X". The blue tips of the "X" then emit blue beams of light that come together to form a blue galaxy-like portal containing numerous stars and galaxies within, from which the Xyz Monster manifests itself (first appearing as a silver gray double helix made up of numerous small cubes before dispersing, then coming together to form the Monster itself).
