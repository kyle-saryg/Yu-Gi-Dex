 Pharaoh  was  Lyman Banner 's cat. When Banner was alive, he had a relationship with Pharaoh. He was rarely seen without him, even at official school meetings.
 Vellian Crowler  had a great dislike and fear of Pharaoh, often claiming that the cat had rabies or other diseases.
 After Banner's spirit was freed, it began to live inside Pharaoh. Banner's spirit emerges to support Jaden several times throughout the series, but each time Pharaoh eventually swallows his soul again. 
 In the  last episode  Pharaoh is the one who gives  Jaden Yuki  the note that was given to him from his friends before going out to his adventure.
 Currently, Pharaoh, along with  Lyman Banner 's spirit, is travelling with Jaden.
 In  Yu-Gi-Oh! 3D Bonds Beyond Time , Pharaoh and Banner's spirit accompany Jaden during his search for  Paradox . He is transported to the past and watches the Duel. Later he returns to his own time with Jaden.
 
       Banner and Pharaoh watching the Duel of Jaden, Yusei and Yugi.
