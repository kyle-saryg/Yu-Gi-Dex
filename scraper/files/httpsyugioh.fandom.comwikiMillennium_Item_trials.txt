 Trials 
 Thief 
       The thief  fails the  Millennium Ring  trial.     
 A thief  attempted to steal the  Millennium Ring , but was captured by Tomb Guardians and brought to the shrine. He pleaded for his life and apologized for stealing the Ring. Shadi explained that he was not going to condemn him for the theft, but rather test him to see if he was a chosen bearer of the Ring. The Millennium Ring was placed around the man's neck, but its prongs jabbed into his torso, cutting him deeply. Fire then burst out of his eyes and mouth, killing him. [1] 
 
 Maximillion J. Pegasus 
       Pegasus  passes the  Millennium Eye  trial.     
 Maximillion J. Pegasus  had witnessed the thief being taken captive. Fearing the thief's safety, Pegasus attempted to buy the ring, hoping the Tomb Guardians would let the man go. However Shadi explained that the theft was not the pressing matter and either way the ring was priceless. [1] 
 Pegasus secretly followed the Tomb Guardians to the shrine and witnessed the  thief's failed trial . He was caught spying and brought before Shadi. He begged to be let go and promised not to tell anyone what he had seen. However Shadi would only permit him to leave if he became bearer of a Millennium Item, so he was to be tested by the  Millennium Eye . If he would deemed worthy, Shadi said he would be granted his dearest wish. The other Tomb Keepers cut out Pegasus' left eye and inserted the Millennium Eye into its socket. Pegasus passed the test and for a moment was embraced by an apparition of Cecelia. [1] 
 
 Bakura's father 
         Bakura's father  tries on the Millennium Ring.     
 Bakura's father  spent years searching for the  Millennium Ring  and was driven to the point of obsession. He tracked its location to the Shrine of the Underworld. On seeing it, he disregarded  Shadi 's warnings of the ring's danger and pleaded with him to sell it, offering a rucksack of money. Shadi explained that the ring could not be purchased, but if Bakura wanted to take it, he must put it on and allow the ring to decide if he is worthy. Bakura complied and announced that wearing the ring felt amazing; like nothing he had ever experienced. However, the ring then began to reject him. Ghosts emerged from it and threw him backwards, causing him to drop the ring. [2] 
 
 Ryo Bakura 
         Bakura  picks up the Millennium Ring.

Ryo picked up the Millennium Ring and was accepted as its owner. The ring fused into his torso, as  Dark Bakura  made him his new host. Dark Bakura took control of Ryo's body and proceeded to kill Shadi and attack the  Prana  children. [2]
