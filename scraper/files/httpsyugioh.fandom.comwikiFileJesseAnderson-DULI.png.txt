 Jesse Anderson , spelled  Jesse Andersen  in some video games and called  Johan Andersen  in the Japanese version, is a transfer student hailing from  North Academy  who enters  Duel Academy  in the third year. Jesse is Scandinavian in the Japanese version while he seems to be from the Southern United States in the English version. Sometimes, people call him 'Jess' as a nickname. Jesse is kind, thoughtful, and sometimes shy.
 Excitable and energetic much like  Jaden  (similarities between him and Jaden are noted in both versions, from their personalities to their ability to see Duel Spirits), he serves as one of Jaden's allies. Although a close friend, his disappearance serves a catalyst for Jaden's descent into darkness as  The Supreme King  of the alternate dimension. Jesse is later possessed by the spirit of  Yubel , Jaden's favorite card in childhood, using him and his " Crystal Beasts " as mediators to act through.

 Design 
 Appearance 
         Jesse's design incorporates multiple layers of clothing and a wide range of expressions. Depicted here is the  Duelist  in full regalia from the front, side, and rear alongside views of his head from different angles.     
 Jesse's usual outfit consists of a blue above-waist-length jacket with dark blue outlines, a lavender shirt with frilled cuffs at the wrists of his sleeves, and black pants which are held up with a white belt. His teal hair juts in backward and down directions. He carries an  Academy-issued Duel Disk  on his left wrist. His outfit when possessed by Yubel, was a dark blue vest with belts strapped onto the front, and a black tank top underneath.
 
 Personality 
 Much like Jaden, Jesse is a passionate duelist who likes to duel for fun. He is very nice, friendly and generous. Just like Jaden, Jesse has a strong link with his cards, he considers it like his family. He will go to great lengths to protect it. He doesn't want it to fall in the wrong hands. However, unlike Jaden he is more serious and mature and a little bit shy.
 
 Voice and mannerisms 
 In the dub, Jesse speaks with a Southern American accent (which becomes more pronounced over time, During a time at a convention in 2021 Jesse's Voice actor Clay Adams confirmed that voice was loosely based off Owen Wilson.) and utilizes southern vocal mannerisms such as "y'all". While possessed by  Yubel , it is much thinner and his voice is much deeper and darker. At first, his voice went back and forth between electronic effect and no effect, but as of  episode 149 , when speaking with his own voice he uses the one with effects exclusively. It's also worth noting that Yubel doesn't usually use her own voice while controlling him in the original, but in the dub she uses it a fair amount. At one point, when she told  Adrian Gecko  about what  Jaden  did to her, she used her voice and Jesse's added together. When she did, his body glowed purple. By contrast the Japanese version does not use electronic effects and he has no accent; but his voice is darker while possessed.
 In addition, he tends to say "Come out!" when Summoning his monsters during the Japanese Duels. In the Japanese version, Jesse claims that his purpose for Dueling is to Duel for people who believe in their Decks and have strong bonds with their cards.
 
 Abilities 
 Similar to  Jaden , Jesse possesses the ability to communicate with Duel Monster spirits since he was a child. His spirit partner is  Crystal Beast Ruby Carbuncle , whom he affectionately nicknames, "Ruby". Although Ruby is seen most frequently by his side, Jesse considers all his monsters a part of his "family", for they themselves selected him as their master.
 Wielding the power of the  Rainbow Dragon , Jesse can open a dimensional gateway and even purify Jaden of the power of  Nightshroud  that tainted his " Polymerization " card.
 
 
 Biography 
 Dimension World 
 Invited along with his fellow  Overseas Champions  from around the world by  Chancellor Sheppard , Jesse is the most secretive of his identity even with those he's traveling with. Although he doesn't board the ship that's supposed to take the champions to their final destination,  Adrian Gecko  expects that Jesse would appear once they reached  Duel Academy . He's known as a "ghost" or the "mystery man" until officially introduced during the school's year-opening ceremony. Before this he had already met  Jaden Yuki  and the two had already become good friends due to their ability to see Duel Spirits. Even so,  Syrus  and  Hassleberry  interrupt the two before Jesse has a chance to reveal his name. He turned up late at the opening ceremony, where he had already being labelled missing, claiming he had got lost and apologizes to Jaden for not telling his name. Jaden doesn't seem to mind and the two remain friends.
 
         Jesse alongside his  Spirit Partner ,  Crystal Beast Ruby Carbuncle .     
 He is chosen by  Thelonious Viper  to Duel Jaden in the first exhibition match of the third year and the two are unknowingly fitted with  Bio-Bands . Just as Jesse is about to be defeated by Jaden he suddenly reveals the name of his most powerful monster: " Rainbow Dragon ". However, he later confesses that "Rainbow Dragon" has not yet been made into a card by  Industrial Illusions  and that he wishes to find the Roman lithograph from which the concept of his " Crystal Beasts " was derived in order for  Pegasus  to finally create it. He spends time with Jaden looking though cards.  Syrus Truesdale  starts to get jealous. 
 In  episode 115  it is introduced that Jesse has been looking for a Duelist called  Trapper  whose name is derived from the fact that he takes opponent's cards after  winning a Duel , and in the same episode Jesse Duels Trapper and defeats him.
 After being drawn into an  alternate dimension , Jesse and the rest of Duel Academy are contacted by  Dr. Eisenstein , who tells them that the lithograph has finally been found. Securing the lithograph's excavation site, Pegasus has the "Rainbow Dragon" card made and sent to the other world via a Duel Energy-powered wormhole which opened in a battle between Jesse and  Zane Truesdale . Jesse later uses the "Rainbow Dragon" when Jaden fought  Marcel  only to learn their real opponent is  Yubel , the Duel spirit that took control of Marcel. Jesse uses "Rainbow Dragon" to get Jaden and the others out while he remains in the alternate dimension to face Yubel, prompting Jaden and his friends to dive back into a rift left open between the worlds to get him back.
 
         Jesse while possessed by  Yubel     
 Although labeled dead by many, he later appears as merely a shadow standing on a cliff near Syrus and  Ojama Yellow , but it's later confirmed that the shadow was Jesse in Ojama Yellow's flashback where it spots him. He later reappears in front of Zane and it is revealed that he is possessed by Yubel. After defeating Zane using " Advanced Crystal Beasts " ( DARK  versions of his regular "Crystal Beasts"), Yubel challenges Adrian to a Duel in order to restore its lost energy. Jesse is able to easily destroy  Exodia  in the first turn and Summon the  Sacred Beasts  one after the other in quick succession before fusing them to form " Chaos Phantasm Armityle ". When his Sacred Beast strategy fails after they are all  removed from play , he switches to survival tactics, keeping Adrian's " Fog King " away from his life points before being able to destroy it. After Adrian suddenly places most of Exodia in his hand with the last piece on top of his Deck, Jesse pulls out all the stops and Summons " Yubel ", his second ace card, defeating Adrian and draining  Echo 's darkness and spirit to restore himself to full strength.
 
         Jesse/Yubel alongside the " Advanced Crystal Beasts "     
 When Jaden Duels Yubel to save Jesse it is revealed that Yubel actually removed Jesse's soul from his body and placed him inside the " Rainbow Dark Dragon " before taking over. However, when Jaden activates the " Super Polymerization "  Spell Card , "Rainbow Dark Dragon" is returned to normal and Jesse is set free, returning to his body. Using its last two cards, Yubel takes "Super Polymerization" using " Last Trick " and ends the Duel in a  DRAW  with " Thousand Buster ". The explosion caused by that card nearly kills Jesse as Yubel leaves his body, but Jaden gets him out in time. Jesse gives Jaden his Deck to help him against Yubel, as he is too weak to Duel himself at the point. Jaden uses "Rainbow Dragon" in order to use " Rainbow Neos ".
 
 Darkness 
         Jesse's soul trapped in the " Rainbow Dark Dragon " card     
 At the beginning of Season 4, Jesse returns to  North Academy  but he comes back when  Jaden  is about to leave  Domino City . Jaden's " Polymerization " card was tainted in darkness by  Sartorius  putting his " Arcana Force 0 - The Fool " in Jaden's Deck and he thought Jesse was  Trueman . The darkness only lifted once "Polymerization" flew out of Jaden's  Graveyard   and Jaden saw that Jesse was really the one he was Dueling. Afterward they return to  Duel Academy  to fight the Trueman army in time to witness the defeat of  Atticus Rhodes  at the hands of  Nightshroud . The two of them then Duel Nightshroud and although Jesse is beaten during the Duel, Jaden continues and is able to use " Rainbow Neos " during it because Jesse was around. Jesse keeps guarding  Yusuke Fujiwara  while Jaden searches for the source of the darkness that still covers the world and when he comes back to the Duel place it is strongly insinuated that Jesse was assimilated by Nightshroud. However, he is revived with the antagonist's demise.
 He then makes a small appearance during the graduation party noting that his graduation at North Academy is held at a different time than at Duel Academy. He,  Alexis  and  Axel  stand by the lake and wonder where Jaden went and talk about how they will all see each other again.
 
 
 Yu-Gi-Oh! Bonds Beyond Time 
 Although Jesse does not appear in  Yu-Gi-Oh! 3D Bonds Beyond Time ,  Paradox  stole his " Rainbow Dragon ", which he used to create " Malefic Rainbow Dragon ".  Jaden , furious at this, cursed Paradox for this action.
 
 Other appearances 
 In the  Yu-Gi-Oh! GX  manga , he and the rest of the  Overseas Champions  are from the American Duel Academy. Jesse has an interest in bugs and he first meets  Jaden Yuki  and  Syrus Truesdale  when he is chasing a rare beetle. He also plays an  Insect  Deck to reflect his interest.

 Decks 
 Crystal Beast 
 Jesse uses a  " Crystal Beast " Deck . His  monsters  are based on seven precious gemstones collected from around the globe for the construction of a lithograph as evidence of  Julius Caesar 's reign during the time of the Roman Empire. On its return trip, the ship carrying the stones was battered by a storm, and the treasures disappeared into the depths of the ocean. Employing this concept,  Pegasus  specially designed and created the "Crystal Beasts", which have the unique ability to retreat in a crystallized  Continuous Spell  form to their  controller 's  Spell & Trap Card Zone  when  destroyed  as means of avoiding complete annihilation.
 Due to the exclusivity of the cards, the Princeton family once attempted to purchase them using all its assets, but were rejected. Instead, Pegasus awarded them to Jesse at the end of a European tournament (in the dub, it was a Southern Tournament). The only "Crystal Beast"-related card not given to Jesse at that time was " Rainbow Dragon ", which wasn't even found until  Duel Academy  was sucked into the  alternate dimension . However, when he gets the card, Jesse focuses his strategies around gathering all the "Crystal Beasts" together to Summon it.

 While under  Yubel's  control, Jesse used two Decks. One was an  " Advanced Crystal Beast " Deck , which, like Jaden's " Evil HERO " Deck, included darker versions of the original " Crystal Beasts " he owned, as well as a  darker version  of his " Rainbow Dragon ".

 This Deck was only revealed when Jesse  Dueled   Adrian Gecko , but while under  Yubel 's control, he also ran another variation of the  Sacred Beast  Deck , which was very different from  the version Yubel had used  while possessing  Marcel Bonaparte . This Deck included cards that could duplicate themselves upon  activation  or being Summoned to the field (such as " Triangle Force ", " Delta Barrier ", and " Illusion Brigadier "). With these cards, he could meet the requirements for Summoning each of the Sacred Beasts easily. As with Marcel, several of his cards went by different names in the dub from the  TCG . In this Deck, his ace card was " Yubel ".
