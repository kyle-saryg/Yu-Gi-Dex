 Biography 
       The powered-up U2     
 Yugi and  Katsuya Jonouchi  interacted their pets. Jonouchi's pet,  Joe , initially bullied U2, but they became friends afterwards. [1] 
 Kujirada  linked his pet,  Devil Master , with other Digital Pets and had it eat them, including  Sumomo-chan  and Joe. He tried to let it eat U2, but  Hiroto Honda  arrived, after spending three sleepless nights taking care of  Super Strawberry , which he used to defeat Devil Master, saving U2. [1] 
 Haiyama  later attacked Yugi, causing  Dark Yugi  to emerge. Dark Yugi connected U2 to  Haiyama's Digital Pet . Using the data it incorporated from its connection with Joe, U2 turned into a more powerful form and defeated Haiyama's pet. [1]
