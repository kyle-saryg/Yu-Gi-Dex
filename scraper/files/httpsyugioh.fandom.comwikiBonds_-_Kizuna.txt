 Japanese 
 Donna ni hanaretatte togireru koto wa nai sa                                             
 Yori fukaku e kizamareteyuku 
 Dakara kizutsuku koto o osorezu ni 
 Motto kakenukete yuke 
 Shinjiteru mono sono mune ni dakishimete 
 Shinjitsu wa itsu datte 
 Hitotsu dakara kokoro no koe o kanjite 
 Yuruginai kimochi o kakagete ashita e no kizashi o tsukame
 
 
 English translation 
 No matter how far we are apart, I'll still go on
 I'm going to engrave it even deeper
 So, don't be afraid of getting hurt and...
 Go forth, race through even harder
 and take all of your beliefs into your embrace
 The truth always comes in ones
 so sense the voice inside your heart
 Hoist your firm sentiments
 and seize the signs for tomorrow
 
 
 Japnese Full Version 
 Donna ni harareta'tte togireru koto wa nai sa
 Yori fukaku e kizamareteyuku
 Donna sekai ni ita'tte donna basho ni ita'tte
 Mata sorezore no unmei ga motsureatteyuku
 Hikareau you ni
 Bokura wa kono hoshi de deau tameni umaretekita no darou
 Kono saki ni matsu donna konan o mo koeteyuku tame ni
 Donna ni harareta'tte togireru koto wa nai sa
 Yori fukaku e kizamareteyuku
 Dakara kizutsuku koto o osorezu ni
 Bokura wa kono hoshi de deau tameni umaretekita no darou
 Kujikesou'na toki mo te o sashinobeaeru futari de aru youni
 Motto kakenuketeyuku shinjiteru mono sono mune ni dakishimete
