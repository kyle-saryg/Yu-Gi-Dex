 This section, or a part of it, has been transcluded from  Yu-Gi-Oh! GX - Volume 001 ; any changes involving it should be made  there  instead.  /  
 Years after Yugi's legendary battles, the game is so popular that special institutions dedicated to the art of the Duel have sprung up all over the world. Join Jaden Yuki and his pals at the Academy for the adventures of the next generation of "Yu-Gi-Oh!" [1] 
 The Power of Kaiser! 
 Chazz Princeton, the rising star of Duel Academy, faces the champion Ryo Kaiser in a fiery duel atop an active volcano! While his classmates' eyes are riveted on the big match, Jaden fights alone against Reggie Mackenzie, a duelist possessed by an evil entity. If Jaden wins, he might save the soul of his teacher, Miss Hibiki. If Jaden loses, Reggie will steal his precious "Winged Kuriboh" card…and Jaden's soul in the bargain! [2] 
 
 The Story So Far 
 On an island in the southern sea there is an academy that trains the next generation of duelists—the Duel Academy! 
 Jaden Yuki learned about the excitement of dueling through an encounter with the World Dueling Champion, Koyo Hibiki. Entrusted with Hibiki's deck, Jaden takes on all challengers at the Academy in order to become a true duelist! 
 Syrus's older brother Zane, aka Kaiser, the top-ranked duelist, has returned from America and a tournament is being held at the Academy to win the right to challenge him. After losing a duel against Chazz, Jaden is led by Winged Kuriboh to where Ms. Hibiki is fighting a "Shadow Game". But Ms. Hibiki loses to Reggie… Meanwhile, a special duel begins! Chazz has taken the initiative, summoning the strongest monster card he has…! [2] 
 
 In the Next Volume… 
 James "Crocodile" Cook, one of the four Duelists from America, eagerly challenges Atticus Rhodes to a Duel. Elsewhere Jaden and Chazz unlock more secrets of their spirit cards, Winged Kuriboh and Light and Darkness Dragon. But their confrontation could lead to a Shadow Game that only one Duelist may survive!

 Yugi's 13th anniversary is coming up next year. And some think we should make a website for Studio Dice to commemorate it. So we might. We'll give it a good try. [2]
