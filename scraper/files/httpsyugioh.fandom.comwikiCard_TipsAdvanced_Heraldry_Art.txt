 " Heraldic Beast Leo " and either " Heraldic Beast Amphisbaena " or " Charged-Up Heraldry " in hand sets up this card's effect with as few cards as possible, with the first  Xyz Monster  summoned only needing to detach one material for its effect, so that this card can revive "Leo" and that material in order to set up the relevant  Xyz Summon .
 If you use "Charged-Up Heraldry", you are limited to  Psychic  and  Machine  Xyz Monsters. 
 " Summon Limit " can be used to block this card's Xyz Summon, provided that you have already summoned once before activating this card on the same turn.
