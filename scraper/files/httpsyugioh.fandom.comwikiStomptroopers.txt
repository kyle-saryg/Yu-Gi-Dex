 History 
   This summary is currently incomplete. 
 Friendship Cup 
 When the  Lancers ,  Crow ,  Shinji ,  Damon , and  Chojiro  escaped from the  Facility , the Stomptroopers cornered Yuya,  Sylvio , and Chojiro on the roof. They challenged them to a Duel and were defeated after  Gong  and  Shay  joined the Duel. [1] 
 
 Friendship Cup Finals 
 When the Lancers, Crow, Shinji, Damon, Chojiro, and  other inmates  were causing a riot in the  Underground Labor Facility , the Stomptroopers arrived and aimed their net guns at the prisoners from the conveyor belts. The commander gave the order to prepare the shot, but Shinji started up the conveyor belts again, dislodging them and causing them to drop their weapons. [2]  The Stomptroopers also ended up being  controlled  by Roget and Dueled  Sora  and  Moon Shadow  in  Sector Security 's Main Bureau but were defeated. [3] 
 
 Deck 
 The Stomptroopers use  " Goyo " Decks . Similar to the  Obelisk Force , they rely on numbers, rather than brute force, in order to overwhelm their opponents. Their ace card, " Goyo King ", allows them to use their opponents' monsters against them, with its cost being easily covered by the  swarming  capabilities of " Goyo Defender ".
