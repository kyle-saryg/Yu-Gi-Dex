 Events 
 Prior 
 The prisoner   escaped  from  Domino City Jail  and ran towards  Domino City . While running he became thirsty. Discovering he was near  Burger World , he went inside to get drinks and a cigarette. At the door, he grabbed the waitress,  Anzu  and held a gun to her head. He warned everyone to be quiet, or he would kill her. Anzu was forced to blindfold herself with the ribbon from her uniform and the customer,  Yugi , was forced to serve him vodka and  Lucky Stripe  cigarettes.
 Yugi switched to  Dark Yugi , who gave the convict what he ordered, but then sat down across from him and challenged him to a game. The convict put his cigarette in his mouth and began pouring his drink as Dark Yugi explained the rules.
 
 Game 
 The convict chose to use his right index finger, thinking he could just shoot Dark Yugi. Dark Yugi chose his thumb.
 As the convict was about to pull the trigger, Dark Yugi used his thumb to switch on a cigarette lighter. The convict allowed Dark Yugi to light his cigarette as the last thing he did before dying. However after doing so, Dark Yugi placed the lighter on the convict's left arm, which was still pouring the vodka. The vodka in the glass began to overflow and spill on the convict. Dark Yugi warned him that by shooting, he would knock the lighter and set the vodka on fire.
 Dark Yugi stood up and escorted Anzu away, who was still blindfolded. The convict eventually dropped his cigarette, setting himself ablaze.
 
 Aftermath 
 Dark Yugi switched back to Yugi, who had no recollection of what happened. After Anzu removed her blindfold, she looked around for the man who saved her and could not believe it was Yugi, as he had no knowledge of what happened. She thought to herself that she had fallen in love with the man who saved her.
