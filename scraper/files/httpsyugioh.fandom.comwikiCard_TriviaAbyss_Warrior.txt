 This card is a counterpart of " Abyss Soldier ": they both have the same  Attribute ,  Type ,  ATK ,  DEF , similar weapons, their effects are activated by  discarding  a  WATER  monster and both are  whales . 
 This monster is based on  Physeteroidea whales . 
 Interestingly, this card does not share the same naming pattern as the other " Abyss- " cards despite being part of that archetype by its Japanese name and being released in  Abyss Rising , the same pack as the "Abyss-" support cards.
