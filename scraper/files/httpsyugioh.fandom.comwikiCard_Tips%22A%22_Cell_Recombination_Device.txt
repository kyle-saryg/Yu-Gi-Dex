 This card can be  searched  by " Cosmic Slicer Zer'oll ", " Spell Calling ", " Quick Booster " and " Mecha Phantom Beast Jaculuslan ". 
 Activate this card when a monster declares an attack on your " Alien Skull ", " Alien Warrior ", " Alien Kid ", " Alien Telepath ", or " Alien Overlord " to potentially destroy the attacker and deal damage to your opponent.
 Send " Alien Stealthbuster " in order to add another two  A-Counters . 
 Use " Code A Ancient Ruins " to Special Summon the monster sent from Deck to Graveyard by this card, as long as it's Level 2 or higher.
 This allows for the quick summoning of " Alien Hypno " from your Deck with its Gemini effect active, while leaving the opposing monster with enough A-Counters for "Alien Hypno" to take control of after applying the effect of "Code A Ancient Ruins". If your opponent controls multiple face-up monsters, " Alien Overlord " can be Special Summoned from the hand first, then "Alien Hypno" will be able to take control of up to three monsters. 
 " Alien Mother " can be summoned from the Deck this way, and be followed up by easily summoning "Alien Overlord" from your hand to make a  Rank 6   Xyz Monster .  Rank 3  and  Rank 4  monsters can similarly be made, but use up your Normal Summon. 
 Use this card during your opponent's turn to send a Level 4 " Alien " to your Graveyard, then during your next turn banish this card to search " Alien Ammonite " to help you Synchro Summon a Level 5  Synchro Monster .
