 The  ZTV announcer  was the presenter of the  ZTV  game show,  The Get the Million Game . [1] 
 He introduced the games and announced the players' results. [1] 
 He was surprised when  Jonouchi  stopped the wheel in  The Wheel of Fate  on "¥1,000,000", since he'd never seen that happen before, which is because the game was normally rigged for the player to lose. After Jonouchi's win, he noticed the  producer  acting crazy in front of the camera and sighed, saying that they were done for. [1]
