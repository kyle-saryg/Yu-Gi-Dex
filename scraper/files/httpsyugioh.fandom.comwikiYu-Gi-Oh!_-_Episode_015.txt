 Summary 
 Back at the  Duel ,  Yami Yugi  and  PaniK  continue to exchange words. PaniK, trembling in fear,  Summons  " King of Yamimakai " and  attacks , but the attack is redirected to " Reaper of the Cards " and takes a huge chunk of PaniK's own  Life Points . 
 Yami Yugi  activates  " Swords of Revealing Light ", revealing all of PaniK's  monsters  and preventing them from attacking for three  turns . PaniK counters with " Chaos Shield ",  switching  all of his monsters to  Defense Position  and raising their  DEF , combining it with the  Castle of Dark Illusions  to create an impenetrable barrier.
 Knowing that most of Yami Yugi's monsters are too weak to  destroy  his shield, PaniK demands he gives up, but Yami Yugi is not intimidated, claiming he knew PaniK's strategies the second he met him and that he walked right into his trap. PaniK threatens to burn Yugi to a cinder but Yugi rebuttles claiming that burning him to death will prove he is a coward. PaniK strengthens his defense with  Metal Guardian .
 Yami Yugi summons " Catapult Turtle ", uses it's effect to raise the ATK of " Gaia the Dragon Champion ", then tributes the latter for the former to attack " Castle of Dark Illusions ", destroying the flotation ring. However, the castle is still standing.
 Still unintimidated, Yami Yugi says the only reason why his castle is still standing is because the "Swords of Revealing Light" are holding it up. Once they disappear, the castle comes crashing down. 
 Since PaniK has trapped his monsters inside the "Chaos Shield", all but "Metal Guardian" are destroyed and PaniK loses the duel. PaniK tries to kill Yami Yugi by firing flames towards him, but his  Millennium Puzzle  protects him. 
 PaniK is then destroyed by Yami's  magical powers . After the duel, Yugi offers  Mai  her  Star Chips  back, but Mai refuses to take them as she believes she does not deserve them. After  Joey  plays around and tries to steal the chips, Mai demands that he give them back, and he does. As Yugi and the group leave, Mai thanks Yugi for his effort, saying that when they meet again, she will repay him and face him in an honorable duel.
 
 Featured Duel: Yami Yugi vs. PaniK 
 
 This Duel uses  Duelist Kingdom  gameplay. Rules and  card effects  may differ from that of the  TCG / OCG . See the individual card articles for more information.     
 Duel continues from the previous episode . 
 Yugi  has 1606  LP  remaining, and  controls  " Curse of Dragon " (2000/1500) in  Defense Position , " Spellbinding Circle " and 2  Set  cards. 
 PaniK  has 2000 LP remaining, and  controls  " Castle of Dark Illusions " (920 → 1196/1930 → 2509) in Defense Position, " Barox " (1380 → 1794/1530 → 1989), " Dark Chimera " (1610 → 2093/1460 → 1898) and "Reaper of the Cards" (1380 → 1094/1930 → 2509) all in  Attack Position , and no Set cards.
 Turn 11: PaniK 
PaniK has four  turns  remaining. PaniK  draws  " King of Yamimakai " and subsequently Normal Summons it (2000 → 2600/1530 → 1989) in Attack Position. "King of Yamimakai"  attacks  "Curse of Dragon", but the light from "Spellbinding Circle" redirects the attack to "Reaper of the Cards",  destroying  the latter (PaniK: 2000 → 494 LP). Yugi then  activates  his  face-down  " Swords of Revealing Light ". Now for three turns, all  monsters  PaniK controls must be  face-up  and cannot attack.
 Turn 12: Yami Yugi 
Yugi passes. The effect of "Swords of Revealing Light" will expire in two turns.
 Turn 13: PaniK 
PaniK has three turns remaining. PaniK draws " Chaos Shield " and subsequently activates it to increase the  DEF  of all his monsters ("Castle of Dark Illusions": 1196/2509 → 3200, "Barox": 1794/1998 → 2600, "Dark Chimera": 2093/1898 → 2600, "King of Yamimakai": 2600/1989 → 2600) and  switch  them to Defense Position.
 Turn 14: Yami Yugi 
Yugi draws " Gaia The Fierce Knight " and subsequently Normal Summons it (2300/2100) in Attack Position. He then activates his face-down " Polymerization " to  fuse  "Curse of Dragon" with "Gaia The Fierce Knight" in order to  Fusion Summon  " Gaia the Dragon Champion " (2600/2100) in Attack Position. The effect of "Swords of Revealing Light" will expire in one turn.
 Turn 15: PaniK 
PaniK has two turns remaining. PaniK draws " Metal Guardian " and subsequently Normal Summons it (1150 → 1495/2150 → 2795) in Defense Position. Since "Metal Guardian" is in Defense Position, Yugi cannot attack any monster PaniK controls, except "Metal Guardian".
 Turn 16: Yami Yugi 
Yugi draws. He then Normal Summons " Catapult Turtle " (1000/2000) in  Defense Position . Yugi then activates the effect of "Catapult Turtle", increasing the  ATK  of "Gaia the Dragon Champion" by 600 ("Gaia the Dragon Champion": 2600 → 3200/2100) and  Tributing  it to destroy the floatation ring of "Castle of Dark Illusions". Shortly after doing this, Yami Yugi takes damage (Yugi: 1606 → 300 LP). However, "Castle of Dark Illusions" remains floating. Yugi explains that the only reason "Castle of Dark Illusions" is still floating is because of the effect of "Swords of Revealing Light". At the  End Phase , the effect of "Swords of Revealing Light" expires.
 Turn 17: PaniK 
PaniK has one turn remaining. On PaniK's turn, "Castle of Dark Illusions" falls and crashes down on PaniK's monsters, who are unable to escape because of "Chaos Shield". This wipes out the rest of PaniK's Life Points (PaniK: 494 → 0 LP).
 
 Aftermath 
 PaniK, angry that he lost, attempts to kill Yugi with fire, but he gets killed instead (in the dub, Yugi sends him to the  Shadow Realm , though they're little different).
 
 Differences in adaptations 
 The countdown is cut out from the Dub, until this episode and the one prior were aired as their respective episodes, without being spliced together.
 Even then, the numbers are not shown on screen, though Yami still counts down himself. 
 " Chaos Shield " is given a slight redesign in the US Version. 
 The Japanese Player Killer has the kanji for "yami" or "darkness" on his cap, which is removed in the US Version. 
 Before  Yami Yugi  sends PaniK to the  Shadow Realm , the letters P and K can be seen on either side of PaniK's jacket, presumably a reference to his Japanese nickname, Player Killer. 
 As before, "Barox" has the purple background of a Fusion Monster in the US version, but it's a  Normal Monster  in the Japanese version. 
 After Yami Yugi sacrifices Gaia the Dragon Champion, he has a concerned look on his face in the English version, but in the Japanese version he doesn't have one. 
 Errors 
 When PaniK is becoming nervous after playing "Yellow Luster Shield", "Metal Guardian" can be seen on the field, even though PaniK hasn't played it yet. 
 Yugi's Life Point total is briefly shown as 1606 on the side of his podium before it is actually reduced to that number. 
 When Joey is holding Mai's Star Chips it looks like there are seven instead of eight. 
 The "Swords of Revealing Light" disappeared after two of PaniK's turns, even though Yugi said that it lasts for three of his turns.

 Trivia 
 Yugi wins through what some fans have come to call the " Catapult Turtle Flying Castle Gambit ", which is impossible in a Duel mainly because it disregards "Catapult Turtle's" actual effect and relies on a mechanic probability that would be incalculable in the real card game.
 However, if "Catapult Turtle's"  anime  effect applies, then Yugi's victory can be considered legitimate, as PaniK actually lost because of that particular anime-only effect of "Catapult Turtle" which states that a player could increase the ATK of a monster by 600, then Tribute it, to inflict damage equal to half of its ATK to their opponent. Since "Gaia the Dragon Champion" had 3200 ATK, PaniK would have lost 1600 LP going down to 0. 
 In this episode, many of the changes to ATK, DEF and Life Points are obviously intended to round to the nearest 100, in stark contrast to the previous episode, where all of PaniK's monsters ended up having uneven numbers of ATK and DEF.
