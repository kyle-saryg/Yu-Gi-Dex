 Yugi and Mai's Duel'  is a  Duel  that occurred during the  Yu-Gi-Oh!  anime between  Yami Yugi  and  Mai Valentine  in the  Duelist Kingdom  finals.
 This Duel is based on  Yugi and Mai's Duel  in the  manga series .
 
 Prior Events 
 The first round of the  Duelist Kingdom  finals is set to begin between Yugi Muto and Mai Valentine. Mai is ready to both duel and win. However, Yugi finds himself distracted, and a little disturbed, by the lengths his  alter ego  was willing to go to win against Kaiba earlier on the castle, and is determined to keep him out of this Duel. Or, depending on the version, perhaps he's just thinking about what he'll do once he reaches  Pegasus .
 
 The Duel 
 Turn 1: Mai 
Mai  Normal Summons  " Harpie Lady " (1300/1400) in  Attack Position , then  Sets  a card.
 Turn 2: Yami Yugi 
Yugi Summons " Gaia The Fierce Knight " (2300/2100) in Attack Position. Yugi  attacks  "Harpie Lady" with "Gaia", but Mai  activates  her face-down " Mirror Wall " to  negate  the attack and halve the  ATK  of "Gaia The Fierce Knight" (2300 → 1150/2100).
 Turn 3: Mai 
Mai  equips  "Harpie Lady" with " Cyber Shield ", increasing its ATK and  DEF  by 500 (1300 → 1800/1400 → 1900). Mai attacks and  destroys  "Gaia The Fierce Knight" with "Harpie Lady" (Yugi: 2000 → 1350).
 Turn 4: Yami Yugi 
Yugi Summons " Summoned Skull " (2500/1200) in Attack Position. "Summoned Skull" attacks "Harpie Lady", with Yugi not knowing that "Mirror Wall" is a  Continuous Trap Card , and thus can be used again. The  effect  of "Mirror Wall" then activates, which negates the attack and halves the ATK of "Summoned Skull" (2500 → 1250/1200). Yugi Sets a card.
 Turn 5: Mai 
Mai activates "Harpie's Feather Duster" to destroy Yugi's Set " Spellbinding Circle ".
 Turn 6: Yami Yugi 
Yugi  changes  "Summoned Skull" to  Defense Position  and Sets a monster face-down.
 Turn 7: Mai 
Mai equips "Harpie Lady" with " Rose Whip ", increasing its ATK and DEF by 300 (1800 → 2100/1900 → 2200). "Harpie Lady" attacks and destroys Yugi's Set " Feral Imp " (1300/1400).
 Turn 8: Yami Yugi 
Yugi passes his turn.
 Turn 9: Mai 
Mai Summons " Harpie's Pet Dragon " (2000/2500) in Attack Position. "Harpie's Pet Dragon" gains 300 ATK and DEF for each "Harpie Lady" on the field, and there is currently one (2000 → 2300/2500 → 2800). Mai attacks and destroys "Summoned Skull" with "Harpie's Pet Dragon".
 Turn 10: Yami Yugi 
Yugi Summons " Dark Magician " (2500/2100) in Defense Position, then Sets a card.
 Turn 11: Mai 
Mai activates " Shadow of Eyes ". Now all male monsters that Yugi controls that are in Defense Position are switched to Attack Position. Any monsters that have been affected by this effect must attack the turn they have been switched to Attack Position. "Dark Magician" is switched to Attack Position and is forced to attack "Harpie Lady". The effect of "Mirror Wall" then activates, negating the attack and halving the ATK of "Dark Magician" (2500 → 1250/2100). Mai then activates another "Harpie's Feather Duster" to destroy Yugi's Set " Mirror Force ". Mai attacks and destroys "Dark Magician" with "Harpie's Pet Dragon" (Yugi: 1350 → 300).
 Turn 12: Yami Yugi 
At this point, after a brief pep talk from Mai, and the  Spirit 's assurance he will not go against Yugi's wishes, Yugi begins focusing seriously on the Duel. Yugi activates " Brain Control ", allowing him to take control of "Harpie's Pet Dragon". Yugi then Sets a card and Summons " Catapult Turtle " (1000/2000) in Attack Position. Yugi then activates the effect of "Catapult Turtle",  Tributing  "Harpie's Pet Dragon" to  destroy  "Mirror Wall" and inflict  damage  to Mai equal to half the  ATK  of "Harpie's Pet Dragon" on the  field  (Mai: 2000 → 850).
 Turn 13: Mai 
Mai draws. She then activates " Elegant Egotist " to turn her one "Harpie Lady" into three "Harpie Ladies" (2450/2100 each) in Attack Position. Mai decides not to  attack  as she believes Yugi's Set card is a  Trap Card .
 Turn 14: Yami Yugi 
Yugi reveals his bluff by activating his  face-down  " Monster Recovery ", which allows him to shuffle "Catapult Turtle" and the remaining cards in his  hand  to his  Deck  and draw five new cards. Yugi's new hand contains " Kuriboh ", " Celtic Guardian ", " Mystical Elf ", " Monster Reborn ", and " Horn Imp ". Yugi Normal Summons " Mystical Elf " (800/2000) in  Defense Position . This monster is  unaffected  by the effect of "Shadow of Eyes" since it is a  female  monster.
 Turn 15: Mai 
Mai activates "Monster Reborn" to  Special Summon  " Harpie's Pet Dragon " from her  Graveyard  in Attack Position. This time, there are three "Harpie Ladies" on the field (2000 → 2900/2500 → 3400). Mai attacks and destroys "Mystical Elf" with her "Harpie Ladies".
 Turn 16: Yami Yugi 
Yugi draws and activates " Swords of Revealing Light ". Mai's monsters cannot attack for three  turns  and all of her monsters must be  face-up . Yugi then Summons " Kuriboh " (300/200) in Attack Position.
 Turn 17: Mai 
Mai passes her turn. "Swords of Revealing Light" has two turns remaining.
 Turn 18: Yami Yugi 
Yugi draws " Polymerization ". Yugi activates "Monster Reborn" to Special Summon "Gaia The Fierce Knight" from his Graveyard in Attack Position.
 Turn 19: Mai 
Mai passes her turn. "Swords of Revealing Light" has one turn remaining.
 Turn 20: Yami Yugi 
Yugi draws " Winged Dragon, Guardian of the Fortress 1 " and passes his turn.
 Turn 21: Mai 
Mai draws another "Harpie Lady" card but decides not to play it as "Harpie's Pet Dragon" has enough ATK to destory Yugi's monster and win the duel. Mai passes her turn. "Swords of Revealing Light" expires, and Mai is now free to attack.
 Turn 22: Yami Yugi 
Yugi tries to draw but the spirit is hesitant to do so, fearing for what might happen if he fails, but Yugi assures him he is not alone, as he has his friends and the Heart of the Cards. Finally, he draws. He compliments Mai on a well played duel but informs her it's over. He reveals and activates " Black Luster Ritual ". He uses "Gaia The Fierce Knight" and "Kuriboh" as Tributes to Ritual Summon " Black Luster Soldier " (3000/2500) in Attack Position. Yugi attacks and destroys "Harpie's Pet Dragon" with "Black Luster Soldier" (Mai: 850 → 750).
 Turn 23: Mai 
At this point, Mai realizes that she has nothing left in her Deck that can destroy "Black Luster Soldier". Not wanting to see her "Harpie Ladies" destroyed, Mai surrenders the Duel.
 Yugi wins.
 
 Aftermath 
 Mai is eliminated from the tournament. Before she leaves, Yugi thanks her not just for the duel, but for talking some sense into him. The next round between  Joey Wheeler  and  Bandit Keith  starts soon.
