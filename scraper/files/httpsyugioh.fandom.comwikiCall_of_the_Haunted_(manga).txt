 Notes 
 
 ↑   In terms of its effect on gameplay, this card continually revived any monsters from its controller's Graveyard that were destroyed by battle. In  Yu-Gi-Oh! Duelist  Duel 31: " Call of the Grave " ,  Bonz  explained that a monster that had "received the power of the Undead" gained a 10% ATK boost each time it was "killed and revived", with the ATK boost based on its current ATK (not its original ATK). In  Yu-Gi-Oh! Duelist  Duel 32: " Death to the Undead! " , it was also explained that the revived monsters had a DEF of 0 (unknown if original DEF) and that monsters that were originally "undead" could not be revived by this card.
