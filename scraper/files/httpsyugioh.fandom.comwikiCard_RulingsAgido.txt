 OCG Rulings 
 This card's effect does not  target . [1] 
 Previously Official Rulings 
   These TCG rulings were issued by  Upper Deck Entertainment  and have since been deemed unofficial by Konami. [2]  They were previously considered official and can still be correct, as long as they follow the official gameplay rules, or unless Konami has issued a ruling that says otherwise. References:  [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] 
 
 " Agido " can  Special Summon  itself. 
 " Agido "'s effect does not  target . 
 While " Necrovalley " is active, the effect of " Agido " will activate, but will be  negated . 
 Mentions in Other Rulings 
 Necrovalley : " Necrovalley " negates any effect that targets a card or cards in the  Graveyard . So "Necrovalley" WILL negate the effect of:..." Agido ". [Notes 1] 
 
 
 
 Notes 
 
 ↑   The latest print of "Necrovalley" has  Problem-Solving Card Text  which states that it negates the effects of cards that move cards in the Graveyard to other locations, regardless of whether or not they target. Despite this effect not targeting, this ruling is correct that it is negated by "Necrovalley".
