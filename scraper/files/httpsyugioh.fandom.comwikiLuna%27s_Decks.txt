Luna  plays an  Ancient Fairy Deck , consisting of folkloric creatures and enchantments, mostly in the form of  Fairy ,  Plant  and  Beast - Type   monsters . Several of them are based on the spirits that Luna befriended in the  Duel Monsters Spirit World , notably her  Spirit Partner ; " Kuribon ", " Regulus ", and her  Signer Dragon ; " Ancient Fairy Dragon ". She carries many support cards that protects them from harm, including the field spell,  Ancient Forest , which prevents any monster from switching to  Defense Position  and destroys them after they  attack . Although Luna rarely Dueled in the anime, she is available to Duel in every  Yu-Gi-Oh! 5D's  game to date.
