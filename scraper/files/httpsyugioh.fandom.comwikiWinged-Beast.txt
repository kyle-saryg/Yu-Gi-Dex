 Winged Beast  ( 鳥 獣   Chōjū  "Avian Beast")  monsters  represent creatures of flight such as birds or bats. The " Harpie "  archetype , one of the most renowned, is comprised primarily of Winged Beasts. The " Blackwing " archetype is composed of  DARK  Winged Beast- Type  monsters that were first released in  Crimson Crisis , with further support in  Raging Battle  and  Ancient Prophecy . Winged Beasts commonly have effects related to removing cards from the field, especially cards in the  Spell & Trap Card Zone , although some are designed instead to take advantage of an opponent without any cards in their Spell & Trap Card Zone once it has been cleared by the others. One fine example of a card making use of Winged Beast monsters is " Icarus Attack ", being extremely popular in the aforementioned "Blackwing" Decks. 
 Few Winged Beasts are considered to be powerful cards although some of the best are " Sacred Phoenix of Nephthys ", " Simorgh, Bird of Sovereignty ", " Earthbound Immortal Aslla Piscu ", " Earthbound Immortal Wiraqocha Rasca ", " Dark Simorgh ", " D.D. Crow ", " Blackwing Full Armor Master ", " Raiza the Storm Monarch ", " The Atmosphere ", " Windrose the Elemental Lord ", " Simorgh, Lord of the Storm ", and " Raidraptor - Ultimate Falcon ". Interestingly enough, very few of the strongest Winged Beasts are of the  WIND   Attribute .
 Many Winged Beasts are  WIND   Attribute , for instance the  Harpie  monsters, or are  DARK Attribute , including most monsters of the " Blackwing " archetype and all the monsters of the " Raidraptor " archetype as well as " Dark Simorgh ", " D.D. Crow ", and " Battlestorm ". There are also some notable  FIRE Attribute  monsters such as " Firebird ", " Fushi No Tori ", " Fire King Avatar Garunix ", " Fire King High Avatar Garunix " and others like them. A number of  LIGHT Attribute  Winged Beasts also exist, for example the Winged Beasts that comprise part of the " Bujin " archetype. Until  Lord of the Tachyon Galaxy , there were no  WATER  Winged Beasts. To date, only 7 exist: 6 of them were used by the  Yu-Gi-Oh! ZEXAL  character  Rio Kastle  (who also introduced the first Winged Beast-Type  Xyz Monster : " Ice Beast Zerofyne "), and are characterized by an Ice motif; while the other one (" Sirenorca ") was released in  Legacy of the Valiant  to aid her Deck work in the OCG/TCG. This means there are now Winged Beasts of every Attribute, even  EARTH .
 Winged Beasts are most notably used by  Mai Valentine ,  Atticus Rhodes  in the  Yu-Gi-Oh! GX  manga,  all   incarnations  of  Crow Hogan ,  Rio Kastle , and the Obsidian siblings  Shay  &  Lulu .
 Winged Beasts feature in  Structure Deck: Lord of the Storm  and a number of them are present in  Dragunity Legion Structure Deck .
 In  Yu-Gi-Oh! The Falsebound Kingdom , Winged Beasts are treated as  Beast  Monsters.
