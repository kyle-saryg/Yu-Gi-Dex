 Don Thousand's Emblem  is an emblem that is held by  Don Thousand  and is his own variation of the  Barian Emblem . It was an emblem which symbolized the  Barian World  before Don Thousand's defeat against  Astral . 
 
 History 
       Don Thousand's Emblem activating in a duel.     
 It has thus far been seen when he has used his powers in other ways such as healing  Alito  and  Girag ; resulting in them having developed a malicious disposition. [1] [2]  It appears as a  crest  like image of this version of the Barian Emblem and has also been seen being used by members of the  Fearsome Four of the Dark Dueling World  to halve the opponent's  Life Points  and add it to their own at the very beginning of the Duel, effectively cheating. [3] [4] [5] 
 This emblem appears on a wall behind  Vector  while he dueled Nash (in their past lives). [6]  It also appears on his chest, similar to how the regular Barian Emblem appears on Nash's chest in Barian form. [7] [8] 
 The emblem is also on Don Thousand's chest. As he absorbed the energy of the  Seven Barian Emperors , the gems on the emblem glowed with that Emperor's respective color, giving the completed emblem the appearance of a rainbow. [9] 
 The emblem makes an appearance on the card " Rank-Up-Magic Admiration of the Thousands ". [10] 
 This emblem could be based on Michael Moorcock's "Symbol of Chaos", as their designs are similar.
