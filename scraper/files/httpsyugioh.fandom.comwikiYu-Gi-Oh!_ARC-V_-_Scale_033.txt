 Summary 
 To take the G.O.D. card from  Eve ,  Yuya  initiates a  Duel  with her. However, Eve immediately summons famous, but powerful monsters to push Yuya into a corner.
 
 Featured Duel: Yuya Sakaki/Yuto vs. Eve 
 Turn 1: Yuya Sakaki 
Yuya places " Enter-Mate Odd-Eyes Valet " ( PS : 8) and " Enter-Mate Odd-Eyes Butler " (PS: 2) in his  Pendulum Zones . He  Pendulum Summons  " Odd-Eyes Phantom Dragon " (2500/2000) and " Enter-Mate Miss Director " (0/2000). "Enter-Mate Miss Director" cannot be selected as an  attack target  if there is another monster on Yuya's field, also Yuya's " Odd-Eyes " monsters cannot be  destroyed in battle , nor does Yuya take any  Battle Damage  involving those monsters.
 Turn 2: Eve 
Eve places " Mystic Hell Gate " (PS: 1) and " Mystic Heaven Gate " (PS: 12) in her Pendulum Zones. She Pendulum Summons  Level 10  monsters " Mystic Factor Balthazar " (0/0), " Mystic Factor Melchior " (0/0) and " Mystic Factor Caspar " (0/0). Eve activates the effect of "Melchior", using it, "Caspar" and "Balthazar" as  Fusion Materials  to  Fusion Summon  " Phantasm Emperor Trilojig " (4000/4000). Eve activates the effect of "Balthazar", halving her  LP  to  Special Summon  it, "Caspar" and "Melchior", which were used as  Fusion Materials , from her  Graveyard  (Eve: 4000 → 2000 LP). Eve activates the effect of "Caspar", reducing its  Level  by 2 to make the levels of "Balthazar" and "Melchior" become 1. Eve tunes "Caspar" with "Balthazar" and "Melchior" to  Synchro Summon  " Timelord Progenitor Vorpgate " (0/0). Eve activates the effect of "Balthazar", halving her LP to Special Summon it, "Caspar" and "Melchior", which were used as  Synchro Materials , from her Graveyard (Eve: 2000 → 1000 LP). Eve overlays "Melchior", "Caspar" and "Balthazar" to  Xyz Summon  " No. XX Infinity Dark Hope " (4000/4000).
 Eve activates the effect of her "Dark Hope", targeting itself to gain LP equal to its ATK at the End Phase. "Vorpgate" attacks "Odd-Eyes Phantom Dragon", and the former's effect prevents destruction by battle and makes all  Battle Damage  zero. At the end of the battle, "Vorpgate"  banishes  all of Yuya's monsters until the End Phase. "Trilojig" attacks Yuya directly, but Yuya activates the effect of " Smoke Mosquito " (0/0) in his hand, Special Summoning it in  Defense Position , halving the damage Yuya receives (Yuya: 4000 → 2000 LP), and ending the  Battle Phase . At the End Phase, the effect of Eve's "Dark Hope" restores her LP, equal to its  ATK  (Eve: 1000 → 5000 LP), and Yuya's "Odd-Eyes Phantom Dragon" and "Enter-Mate Miss Director" return to the field due to the effect of "Vorpgate".
 At this point,  Yuto  takes over the Duel for Yuya.
 Duel continues in the next Scale .
