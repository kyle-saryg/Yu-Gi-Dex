 Funimation , (formerly known as  Funimation Productions  and  Funimation Entertainment , and usually stylized as  FUNimation ) is an American entertainment company specializing in the licensing and dubbing of anime. 
 They were responsible for producing an "uncut" English dub of the  second series anime , which was more faithful and consistent with the original Japanese version. The uncut DVDs were later pulled from solicitation after Volume 3 "Stolen - Blue-Eyes White Dragon" for no apparent reason, with a variety of explanations coming from, upon cross-examination, invalid sources with little elaboration. Lance Heiskell, a Funimation representative, has noted legal rights as the reason for cancellation, although he was unable to expand on it. This appears to be the most likely possibility, given the DVDs' reportedly successful run.
