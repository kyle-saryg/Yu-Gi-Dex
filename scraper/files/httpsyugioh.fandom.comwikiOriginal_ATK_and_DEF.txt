 Original ATK  ( 元 々 の 攻 撃 力   Motomoto no Kōgekiryoku ) and  original DEF  ( 元 々 の 守 備 力   Motomoto no Shubiryoku ) refer to the  ATK  and  DEF  values of a  Monster Card  before any monster,  Spell , or  Trap Cards  alter the value. They are the ATK and DEF values listed on the card.
 Certain monsters only have well-defined original ATK and DEF while they are on the field. For example, when " Chimeratech Overdragon " is  Fusion Summoned , its original ATK and DEF become a specific value dependent on the number of Materials used to Summon it. Cards with effects that change their own original ATK/DEF normally have a printed ATK/DEF of  ?  or 0. Monsters with an original ATK/DEF of ? are not treated as having an ATK/DEF value that is less than or greater than any value; consequently, cards with an original ATK of ? in the  hand  will not be destroyed by either " Crush Card Virus " or " Deck Devastation Virus ". However, such cards are supported by " Catoblepas and the Witch of Fate ". If a monster on the field has original ATK/DEF of ? and no effect has changed its ATK/DEF, its ATK/DEF is treated as 0; for example, " The Winged Dragon of Ra - Sphere Mode " has ? ATK and DEF but no effect to change its own ATK or DEF, so they will be treated as 0 on the field by default.
