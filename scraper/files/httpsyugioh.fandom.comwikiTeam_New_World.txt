 Team New World  is a team participating in the  WRGP  finals.
 This team is composed by the  Three Pure Nobles . On  episode 117  using their powers to  falsify history , they make people believe that they are a team from this tournament instead of being the directors of  Sector Security . They also took the place that  Team Sherry  was in during the WRGP.
 This was proven because at the time  Team Ragnarok  are looking at a magazine which initially features them on the cover page. However after the Trio used their powers, Team New World has taken their place in the picture. Since the trio used their powers to enter the WRGP it is presumed by the public that their duel record is the same as  Sherry 's teams record, thus 2 wins against unknown WRGP teams.
 In  Episode 134 , it's revealed that the 3 of them were originally one; Aporia. During the duel with Yusei, the 3 combine back into their original form.
 In the dub, they are implied to have always been part of the WRGP, as their alterations to history episodes are not dubbed. Instead an implied timeskip between  Team 5D's  duels against  Team Unicorn  and  Team Ragnarok  takes place.
