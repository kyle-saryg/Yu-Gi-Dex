 "Challenge the Legends!"  is the thirty-forth chapter of the  Yu-Gi-Oh! ARC-V  manga .
 This chapter was first printed in May in the July 2018 issue of  V Jump , released on May 21, 2018.
 
 Summary 
 Yuto  carries on the battle in  Yuya 's stead, but has a difficult time battling  Eve 's  monsters . Yuya, however, remembers the truth behind his "personalities".
 
 Featured Duel: Yuya Sakaki/Yuto vs. Eve 
 Duel continues from the previous Scale . 
 Turn 3: Yuto 
 Yuto   activates  the  effect  of " Smoke Mosquito ", targeting a  monster  on the  field  to make its  Level  equal to the target's. He targets " Odd-Eyes Phantom Dragon " ("Smoke Mosquito" Level: 1 → 7). Yuto overlays "Smoke Mosquito" and "Odd-Eyes Phantom Dragon" to  Xyz Summon  " Dark Anthelion Dragon " (3000/2500). He equips the latter with " XYZ Wings ", which lets "Dark Anthelion Dragon" activate its  Overlay Unit  detaching effect an additional time. Yuto detaches an Overlay Unit of "Dark Anthelion Dragon", halving the ATK of " Phantasm Emperor Trilojig ", increasing the ATK of "Dark Anthelion Dragon" by that amount and increasing Yuto's LP by that amount ("Phantasm Emperor Trilojig": 4000 → 2000; "Dark Anthelion Dragon": 3000 → 5000 ATK; Yuto: 2000 → 4000 LP). Due to "XYZ Wings", Yuto activates the effect of "Dark Anthelion Dragon" once more, and targets " No. XX Infinity Dark Hope " ("No. XX Infinity Dark Hope": 4000 → 2000; "Dark Anthelion Dragon": 5000 → 7000 ATK; Yuto: 4000 → 6000 LP).
 "Dark Anthelion Dragon" attacks "Phantasm Emperor Trilojig", but  Eve  activates the effect of "No. XX Infinity Dark Hope", detaching an Overlay Unit to halve the  Battle Damage  she would take (Eve: 5000 → 2500 LP). "XYZ Wings" then inflicts 500 LP damage to Eve since the equipped monster destroyed an opponent's monster in battle (Eve: 2500 → 2000 LP). The effect of "No. XX Infinity Dark Hope" resolves,  Special Summoning  "Phantasm Emperor Trilojig" that was  destroyed  by that battle. The effect of "Phantasm Emperor Trilojig" activates when a monster is Special Summoned from the Graveyard, inflcting  Effect Damage  to Yuto equal to half the ATK of a monster on the field, with Eve choosing "Dark Anthelion Dragon" (Yuto: 6000 → 2500 LP). In addition, Eve uses the other effect of "No. XX Infinity Dark Hope", targeting a monster that has been Special Summoned - "Phantasm Emperor Trilojig" - and gaining LP equal to its ATK (Eve: 2000 → 6000 LP). At the end of the turn, the effect of "Dark Anthelion Dragon" expires ("Dark Anthelion Dragon": 7000 → 3000 ATK; "No. XX Infinity Dark Hope": 2000 → 4000 ATK).
 At this point,  Yuya  returns to switch sides with Yuto.
 Duel continues in Scale 36.
