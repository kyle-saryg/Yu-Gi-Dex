 A  Duel  (Japanese: デュエル [Notes 1]   Dyueru ) is a single game between two opposing  players  or  teams , who use a variety of  Monster ,  Spell , and  Trap Cards  to defeat their opponent and  win  the game.
 A Duel progresses in a series of  turns  which passes between players as the  Priority  does to organize the play.
 
 Items needed 
 All one need to Duel is a  Main Deck  and an opponent to Duel with. One may also have an  Extra Deck , and also a  Side Deck  in case of a  Match .  Game Mat  and  card sleeves  can also be used to protect cards. If needed, six-sided  die , coins,  counters  and  Tokens  should be prepared if usingcards that involve the said items.
 To keep track of the game, one may also use pencil/pen and a paper to keep track of  LP  and other notes, and a calculator to quickly calculate values.
 
 Preparing to Duel 
 Before starting a Duel, follow these 5 steps.
 
 Shuffle  your Main Deck with all its cards  face-down .
 You may then shuffle and cut your opponent's Deck (be careful when touching your opponent’s cards). 
 After shuffling, place the Decks  face-down  in  Deck Zones .
 If using an Extra Deck, place it in the  Extra Deck Zone  with all its cards face-down. 
 If you are playing a  Match , Duelists show each other their  Side Decks  if they have them without revealing the cards, and record the number of cards in it, also confirming that they have 15 or fewer cards.
 If you exchange cards between the Side and Main/Extra Decks, count the cards of your Side Deck for your opponent again to show that the number of your cards remain the same. 
 Use a random method to choose a player who will chose who to go first.
 Duelists may roll a die, play  rock-paper-scissors , or other methods as long as it is agreed upon and clearly understood by all Duelists beforehand. 
 The Duelist chosen by the random method chooses who goes first. 
 For subsequent Duels in a Match, the losing Duelist of the previous game chooses who goes first. 
 In case of a Duel ending in a  DRAW , another random method should be employed to choose the deciding Duelist. 
 After deciding who go first, both Duelists  draw   five  cards from their Main Deck to form their starting  hands .
 If the deciding Duelist does not announce his or her choice of who will go first prior to drawing cards, they must automatically go first. 
 With these five steps taken, a Duel commences.
