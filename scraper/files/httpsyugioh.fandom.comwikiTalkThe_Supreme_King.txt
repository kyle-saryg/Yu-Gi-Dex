 Image 
 Can someone please get an image that can change sizes because the current image ruins the caption? - DGameBoy21  06:07, 1 July 2007 (UTC)
 
 Couldn't we just take the current image out of the thumb box? Like so? --  Huajun Chen  13:10, 1 July 2007 (UTC) 
 Character Design 
 Can someone please get a design of Haou?  After, that you can delete or correct the appearance? - DGameBoy21  06:07, 1 July 2007 (UTC)
 
 You'll have to wait till September for that, or later depending on the creators' moods. Linework is distrubted as new seasons arrive; it's not all complete and sitting mellow in some file somewhere. --  Huajun Chen  13:10, 1 July 2007 (UTC) 
 Haou's True Identity 
 Haou is revealed to be the embodiment of Jaden's negative feelings brought to life by Yubel.  This confirmed by recent Janime summaries. DGameBoy21  15:03, 18 August 2007 (UTC)
 The somewhat confusing link from episode 154 is implying that Haou (how do pronounce this guy's name?) makes a reappearance during Jaden's duel Yubel. Does he?  —This unsigned comment was made by  76.28.67.168  ( talk  •  contribs ) 21:46, September 16, 2007 
 Never mind, I just answered that for myself from looking the summery again.  —This unsigned comment was made by  76.28.67.168  ( talk  •  contribs ) 21:49, September 16, 2007 
 
 Change of Heart? 
 According to Haou's biography it seems as though because of his past he had a change of heart. Please explain. -- Dark Yugi  12:41, 12 October 2007 (UTC) 
 Move to Supreme King 
 Should we change the page's name to "The Supreme King", because that's what he's called in the dub. He doesn't go by Haou.  —This unsigned comment was made by  RikoTheFoxKid  ( talk  •  contribs ) 19:14, February 18, 2008 
 
 reference of his name 
 in the anime shaman king there is a character named asakura hao -- Sartorias  14:42, December 18, 2009 (UTC)
 
 "Possession"? 
 Yeah, so um, I'd like to know who wrote in that the Supreme King "possesses" Jaden all over the place in this article. Even in the English dub, if you listen to the dialogue, it says repeatedly that the Supreme King and Jaden are the same person, and he's just basically Jaden actively shutting his emotions down. He's not an evil possessing demon in either version.
 ...Therefore, can I please remove those references? They bug the hell out of me because they're blatantly incorrect. -- Qu-ko  01:37, January 21, 2010 (UTC)
 
 Possession isn't entirely accurate, but it's an apt comparison. Judai essentially has a split personality. Judai doesn't so much shut down his emotions as allow his negative emotions to rule his decisions. Hauo is explicitly a separate entity though, since Judai is a reincarnation of him. You know what? As I type this, I'm not sure I get I even get it myself. Nevermind.  Cheesedude  02:10, January 21, 2010 (UTC) 
 I think that that Prince (e.d. Jaden's past life) of Neo Space (or whatever) and The Supreme King aren't exactly the same thing. This could be explained using the concept of " avatar ". The Supreme King would be a mighty spirit bending the power of the Darkness of Justice, and that Prince and Jaden would be his incarnations. -- Aged Goblin  ( talk  •  contribs ) 19:55, January 23, 2011 (UTC) 
 So are the supreme king and jaden the same person in different incarnations, or is it like yugi and atem with two spirits and one body?  —This unsigned comment was made by  67.184.236.116  ( talk  •  contribs ) 00:07, February 18, 2011 
 In truth, Haou is Judai's former life, and Judai reborn with that kind of evil spirit. Haou only emerge once when Judai's best part is broken and gone, like Johan had gone bad under Yubel's control. So I am pretty sure that Haou only possessing Judai's body when Judai himself is losing in the darkness as from losing the hope to save his friend. -- F r e d C a t  00:53, February 18, 2011 (UTC) 
 It's very difficult to really tell. I always took it as a possession - but one that Judai could fight off. But he chooses not to. You see him in his own mind, going "It's all my fault" over and over again. He doesn't fight from within like you would expect him to. A native Japanese speaker may have an easier time telling us. Most YGO sites go with the possession bit, including Janime, for what it's worth. Cheesedude  ( talk  •  contribs ) 01:30, February 18, 2011 (UTC) 
 I thought the spirit of Haou was originally good, but was corrupted by Judai's darkness in heart and took possession over him in the alternate dimension. I don't see him as Judai's evil side - he is something like a spirutal embodient of the power of  Gentle Darkness  rather than an evil alternate pesonality. This also confirms episode 155. I don't know whether it means he is Judai's soul (like Atem and Yami) or another soul which inhabits his body (like Yugi and Yami). I still can't get how Birdman, and possibly other spirits, knew him as an evil tyrant instead of a good guy who saves the universe from the Light. -- Aged Goblin  ( talk  •  contribs ) 02:31, July 25, 2011 (UTC) 
 Foreshadowing in episode 103 
 During episode 103, Judai has a vision during his duel with Saiou. He's standing a desert, and is attacked by a shadowed armored figure. It's unclear what it means at the point, but the shadow greatly resembles The Supreme King's armor, and it also foreshadows the desert dimension. I don't really want to add speculation without discussion, so I thought I'd bring it up here.  Cheesedude  03:01, April 4, 2010 (UTC)
 
 You're totally right. Even Sartorius claimed he showed him a vision of  his  (Jaden's) future. Besides, that wasn't the only vision of future in GX series. That vision and Jaden's daydream in Ep 106 are clearly showing the events of Ep 120 and onwards; In Ep 178, Nightshroud showed Jaden a vision of apocalyptic future of 5D's series and 3D. -- Aged Goblin  ( talk  •  contribs ) 20:39, January 23, 2011 (UTC) 
 i was under the impression the shadowed creature was actually Yubel Das Extremer Traurig Drachen, especially since she was the one who sent them to the desert world, and it had nothing to do with Haou.-- RexGodwin  ( talk  •  contribs ) 00:58, December 4, 2012 (UTC)
 
 Possible father 
 Only in the English version of  Episode 155 ,  King  tells Yubel that the Young Prince (actually the future  Supreme King ) is his son. -- 93.87.166.65  ( talk ) 21:19, January 13, 2011 (UTC)
 
 Neo-Spacians? 
 Is he shown dueling using Neos and Neo-Spacians in Jaden's flashback during  episode 178 ? E-Hero Neos and Neo-Spacian Dark Panther are shown on his side of the field  [1] . I don't know whether this screenshot is really part of the flashback or Jaden imagined himself as the S-King (note: Jaden has the mentioned monsters on his side of the filed at that moment  [2] .) -- 178.223.189.118  ( talk ) 19:20, March 21, 2011 (UTC)
 
 O_O, wow that's bizarre. Interesting catch. I think the animators simply didn't bother to change the monsters on his Duel Disk when they did that scene. I'll check the episode to be sure.  Cheesedude  ( talk  •  contribs ) 20:43, March 21, 2011 (UTC)
 Nope, it just was Jaden's dark speech, a shot of the Supreme King, saying what actually Jaden is saying. I hope you understand, I mean, I think Nightsroud referenced him about the Supreme King and Jaden replies, and the animators just changed Jaden's image for Haou's for a little. It is not a merely flashback.  Siguiendo la luna   no llegare lejos ,  tan lejos como se pueda llegar ♫  20:56, March 21, 2011 (UTC)
 Well, from what I see, the position and card's set are exact same from the past and in that time he is explaining (as Haou) to Darkness. -- F r e d C a t  21:08, March 21, 2011 (UTC)
 It's definitely not a flashback, they do just superimpose the image over him, so to speak. I don't think we need to note it anywhere (maybe in the episode article). That said, had it been a flashback, it would have made his origin story make a little more sense.  Cheesedude  ( talk  •  contribs ) 21:13, March 21, 2011 (UTC) 
 Polymerization 
 Although I put that card in his decklist, I doubt whether he really used it. In episode 146, during Jaden's flashback, The Supreme King said the name of that card ("yuugo"=Fusion in the Japanese version, "Polymerization" in the English dub), Summoning " Evil Hero Inferno Wing ". Even the solid vision indicates resemblance to " Dark Fusion " rather than "Polymerization" itself. Should that card remain in the decklist or not. -- 178.223.144.152  ( talk ) 22:40, March 23, 2011 (UTC)
 
 It's rather ambiguous. He kept insisting that the couldn't play " Polymerization ", but I think they really meant Fusion cards in general. I'm not even sure which way the Japanese version meant it. When they say "yuugo", it's unclear if they mean the card or the action. He was never explicitly shown to play it while he was The Supreme King. Having said that, if you approach it from the logic that his Deck was corrupted, it makes sense. " Dark Fusion " no longer exists after the King is gone, since it was a corrupted regular "Fusion" to begin with. However, that's not ever explicitly stated either.  Cheesedude  ( talk  •  contribs ) 00:03, March 24, 2011 (UTC) 
 Just like the fortuneteller dude's card that corrupted Judai's Polymerization just before Judai challenged Johan who was "Mr. T" at that time. It maybe make a sense since that was before the whole chaos in alternate dimension happened. -- F r e d C a t  00:13, March 24, 2011 (UTC) 
 It would surely make sence that the Deck was corrupted. As for pronunciation of fusion cards, "Fusion" (OCG name, in TCG "Polymerization") is pronounced as "yuugo", "Dark Fusion" has its English naming and pronunciation, while "Super Polymerization" is pronounced as "su yuugo". It seems that the King refered to fusion summoning. However, in the English dub it's obvious the card not the action. If you don't mind, I would remove "Polymerization" from decklist. -- 178.223.144.152  ( talk ) 00:25, March 24, 2011 (UTC)
 Go right ahead and remove it. And "Super Polymerization" is "Cho Yuugo", actually (not that it really matters).  Cheesedude  ( talk  •  contribs ) 00:36, March 24, 2011 (UTC) 
 Deck 
 I believe that the "Roar of the Supreme King" is basically 'Jaden Yuki 10' and the former name was not used as the name of his second Evil HERO deck in Tag Force 3. OrbAdventures  ( talk  •  contribs ) 13:39, May 1, 2013 (UTC)
