 Featured Duels 
 Declan Akaba vs. Riley Akaba 
       Riley  vs.  Declan .     
 At the start of the  Duel , the  Field Spell Card  " Crossover " is  activated , as per the rules of an  Action Duel . It will allow the players to use  Action Cards , but they may only have one in their  hand  at a time.
 Turn 1: Declan 
 Declan   activates  " D/D Brownie " (   2) and " D/D Savant Thomas " (   6) in his  Pendulum Zones . Declan  Pendulum Summons  " D/D Lilith " (100/2100) and " D/D Nighthowl " (300/600) from his  hand  in  Attack Position . He then activates the  Continuous Spell Card  " Dark Contract with Summoning Surplus ", allowing him to Fusion Summon a " D/D/D " monster using monsters on his field. He  fuses  "Lilith" and "Nighthowl" on his field to  Fusion Summon  " D/D/D Flame King Genghis " (2000/1500). As Declan  Special Summoned  a  monster  from his  Extra Deck , he activates the  effect  of "D/D Brownie", Special Summoning it from his Pendulum Zone (0/0) in Attack Position. Since another " D/D " monster was Special Summoned to Declan's  field , the effect of "Genghis" activates, allowing Declan to Special Summon a "D/D" monster from his  Graveyard . He Special Summons "Lilith" (100/2100). As "Lilith" was Normal or Special Summoned, Declan activates its effect, allowing him to add a "D/D" monster from his Graveyard to his hand. He adds "Nighthowl". Declan  tunes  the  Level  3  Tuner monster  "Brownie" with the Level 4 "Lilith" to  Synchro Summon  " D/D/D Gust King Alexander " (2500/2000). Declan  Normal Summons  "Nighthowl" (300/600). Its effect activates, allowing Declan to Special Summon a "D/D" monster from his Graveyard with its  ATK  and  DEF  reduced to 0. He Special Summons "Lilith" (100/2100 → 0/0). Declan activates the second effect of "Summoning Surplus", reducing the Level of a "D/D" monster he controls by 1 until the End Phase. He reduces the Level of "Lilith" to 3. Declan overlays his two Level 3 monsters to  Xyz Summon  " D/D/D Stone King Darius " (1900/1000). He activates the effect of "Darius",  detaching  an  Overlay Unit  to  destroy  a " Dark Contract " card he controls and  add  another "Dark Contract" card from his  Deck  to his hand. [Notes 1]  He destroys "Summoning Surplus" to add " Dark Contract with the Eternal Darkness ", which he immediately  Sets .
 Turn 2: Riley 
Riley's hand contains " Nightmare Critical Loop ", " Re-Fusion ", " Photo Frame ", " Montage Fusion ", and " C/C Critical Eye ". Riley draws " Film Magician ". Declan activates the  Continuous Trap Card  "Dark Contract with the Eternal Darkness". While active, it prevents players who do not control a "Dark Contract with the Eternal Darkness" from activating  Spell / Trap Cards  that  target  monsters, as well as using monsters on the field for  Tribute ,  Fusion ,  Synchro , or  Xyz Summons . However, Declan will take 1000  damage  during each of his  Standby Phases . Riley Normal Summons "Film Magician" (0/0) and Sets a card.
 Turn 3: Declan 
During his Standby Phase, the effect of "Eternal Darkness" inflicts 1000 damage to Declan (Declan 4000 → 3000). "Darius" attacks "Film Magician". As "Film Magician" was attacked, its effect activates, making its ATK/DEF equal to the ATK of "Darius" during  damage calculation  only, while its other effect prevents "Film Magician" from being  destroyed by battle . Since "Darius" would be destroyed by battle, Declan activates its effect, detaching an Overlay Unit to prevent its  destruction , destroy the monster it battled, and inflict 500 damage to Riley (Riley 4000 → 3500). "Alexander" attacks Riley  directly  (Riley 3500 → 1000). Riley obtains an  Action Card . "Genghis" attacks Riley directly, but Riley activates the Action Card " Damage Banish ", reducing the  battle damage  to zero.
 Turn 4: Riley 
Riley  draws  " Pure Ray ". He activates his  face-down  "Photo Frame", which lets him copy the name and effects of a face-up Spell/Trap his opponent controls. He targets "Eternal Darkness". Riley activates "Pure Ray", which lets him destroy a card on both players' fields with the same name and decrease the ATK of all monsters on the field by 100 for each monster on the field. He destroys Declan's "Dark Contract with the Eternal Darkness" and his own "Photo Frame", treated as "Dark Contract with the Eternal Darkness" ("Alexander": ATK 2500 → 2200) ("Darius": ATK 1900 → 1600) ("Genghis": ATK 2000 → 1700). Riley Normal Summons " C/C Critical Eye " (1400/1000). Riley then activates "Montage Fusion", allowing him to Fusion Summon a Fusion Monster as long as both him and his opponent control the required Fusion Material Monsters by using only his monster as a Material. He fuses "Critical Eye" and "Montage Fusion" to Fusion Summon " C/C/C Sonic Halberd of Battle " (3000/0). It can attack twice during the same Battle Phase, but since Declan  controls  a  WIND  monster, "Sonic Halberd" can attack three times. "Sonic Halberd" attacks and destroys "Alexander" (Declan 3000 → 2200) and "Genghis" (Declan 2200 → 900). As "Genghis" was destroyed, its effect activates, allowing Declan to add a "Dark Contract" card from his Graveyard to his hand. He adds "Eternal Darkness". "Sonic Halberd" attacks "Darius".

 Yugo vs. Yuri 
 Duel continues from the previous episode . 
 Turn 6: Yuri 
As a " Greedy Venom Fusion Dragon " was  destroyed  and  sent  to the  Graveyard ,  Yuri   activates  the  effect  of " Predaplant Sarraceniant " granted by "Greedy Venom". He can  banish  that "Sarraceniant" from his Graveyard to  Special Summon  "Greedy Venom" from there. He does so and Special Summons it (3300/2500) in Attack Position. Yuri  Sets  a card. During the  End Phase , the effect of " Crystal Wing Synchro Dragon " wears off, and its ATK returns to its original value ("Crystal Wing": ATK 6300 → 3000).
 Turn 7: Yugo 
"Crystal Wing"  attacks  and destroys "Greedy Venom", with "Crystal Wing" gaining  ATK  equal to the ATK of the  Level  10 "Greedy Venom" during  damage calculation  only ("Crystal Wing": 3000 → 6300) (Yuri 4000 → 1000). As "Greedy Venom" was destroyed, Yuri activates its effect, destroying all  monsters  on the  field , and inflicting  damage  to their  controllers  equal to those monsters'  original ATK . "Crystal Wing" is destroyed (Yugo 4000 → 1000). As "Greedy Venom" was destroyed, Yuri activates the effect of " Starving Venom Fusion Dragon ", granted by "Greedy Venom", in his Graveyard, banishing itself to Special Summon "Greedy Venom" again. As an  Extra Deck  monster was destroyed,  Yugo  activates his  face-down  " Extra Shave Reborn " to Special Summon an Extra Deck monster with a lower Level than the destroyed monster from the Graveyard. Yugo Special Summons " Clear Wing Synchro Dragon ".
 As a monster was Special Summoned to his field, Yugo Special Summons " Speedroid Rubberband Plane " from his hand via its own effect, and activates its effect, which would decrease the ATK of an opponent's monster by 600. As a Level 5 or higher monster on the field activated its effect, Yugo activates the effect of "Clear Wing" to  negate  that effect, destroy that monster, and increase the ATK of "Clear Wing" by that of the destroyed monster until the End Phase ("Clear Wing": ATK 2500 → 4300). "Clear Wing" attacks and destroys "Greedy Venom", but Yuri activates the effect of " Predaplant Drosophyllum Hydra " in his Graveyard, banishing a " Predaplant " monster from his Graveyard and returning another banished monster to his Graveyard to halve the  battle damage  he would take. He banishes " Predaplant Flytrap " from his Graveyard and returns the banished "Starving Venom" (Yuri 1000 → 500). "Greedy Venom" is destroyed. As a monster Special Summoned from his Extra Deck was destroyed Yuri activates his face-down "Extra Shave Reborn" to Special Summon an Extra Deck monster with a lower Level than the destroyed monster. He Special Summons "Starving Venom" (2800/2000) in Attack Position.
 Turn 8: Yuri 
Yuri activates the effect of "Starving Venom", negating the effects of a monster his opponent controls and granting its effects to "Starving Venom" until the End Phase. He negates the effects of "Clear Wing" and has "Starving Venom" gain its effects. Yuri activates " Predapruning ", which lets him Special Summon a "Predaplant" monster from his Graveyard and equip itself to the Summoned monster. He Special Summons "Drosophyllum Hydra" (800/2300). Yuri activates the effect of "Drosophyllum Hydra" to banish a "Predaplant" monster from his Graveyard to decrease the ATK of an opponent's monster by 500. He banishes " Predaplant Moray Nepenthes " and targets "Clear Wing". As a Level 5 or higher monster activated its effect, Yuri activates the effect that "Starving Venom" inherited from "Clear Wing", negating that effect, destroying that monster, and increasing its ATK by the destroyed monster's ATK until the End Phase ("Starving Venom": 2800 → 3600). "Starving Venom" attacks and destroys "Clear Wing" (Yugo 1000 → 0).

 Differences in the dub 
 Ray is given a more glowing appearance around her body in the dub. In additional she does not speak in this episode unlike the original version. 
 Notes 
 
 ↑   Despite Declan doing so, the written lore of "Darius" states that he should have drawn a card instead of searching. 
 
 ↑  2.0   2.1   2.2   This card can be seen in  Yugo 's  Graveyard .
